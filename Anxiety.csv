Gabapentin,"Hey, gabapentin has done wonders for me. I can clearly feel the difference between not taking it and taking it. In school my anxiety is a big problem, I couldnt even look at my classmates, it felt like my body was locked and I couldnt speak or look elsewhere than my pc. When using gabapentin these problems is just gone, Im happy, concentrated and very energetic. It is the best",10,12
Gabapentin,"I am someone who has a whole laundry list of problems (bipolar II with psychotic features, depression, generalized anxiety, ADHD, panic disorder, and dpdr) so that means I have to take a ton of medication and have been in therapy since I was 13. I just started gabapentin at 300 mg 3x a day and my anxiety is almost nonexistent. I used to be absolutely paralyzed by fear at random points during the day for seemingly no reason. To the point that all of my muscles would tense and I would feel like they are on fire. This is the only medication that has helped.",10,14
Gabapentin,Works amazing combined with venlafaxine. It seemed to help overall but taking the two medicines together created amazing clarity and concentration,10,20
Gabapentin,Helps tremendously with anxiety as well as depression.,10,49
Gabapentin,I am just now learning gabapentin helps people for so many different issues. Me personally I call it (My little miracle pill)!,10,35
Gabapentin,"I too went through the awful nightmare  when I quit gabapentin.  In the past I have quit xanax, alcohol, cocaine and a few others and those drugs were a cake walk compared to gabapentin.  I have never felt such anxiety and hopelessness.",3,25
Gabapentin,I am prescribed 300mg a day but can take up to 600mg. I noticed mood stabilization and anxiety riddance by day 4 or 5. The first week I was extremely high on this medication I even left my phone in a Chinese tea shop and had to turn around no joke. I am now enjoying living on campus at ASU and am getting out more by myself. It is helping me more than my benzo script ever did and Im in a low dosage! I got a fever as a side effect when I first started but now it is gone.,10,44
Gabapentin,"No bad side effects. The best drug for anxiety next to Ativan. The only weird, but enjoyable side effect was Closed Eye Visuals or CEVs.  I would wake in the middle of the night and with my eyes closed, I would see beautiful brightly colored patterns, which I would enjoy until I drifted off to sleep again.  I take 600mg 3x per day.",10,33
Gabapentin,"On gabapentin 1 month now.  300 mgs 3 x a day,  off label for anxiety.  So many side effects!!  Blurred and double vision, falling, memory gaps, diarrhea, way too hungry, 12 hour sleeps, ears ringing, and now hands and feet tingling and numb.  Horrible!  Dropped to two doses a day 10 days ago.  Felt better but the tingling had started last 4 days.  Dropped to one dose as of yesterday and going to stop altogether in a couple of days.  Only been a month so not worried about withdrawal, and its been gradual enough.  Yes, it knocked out anxiety, but the side effects arent worth it.",3,22
Gabapentin,"I've struggled with moderate to severe generalized anxiety for all of my life - mostly related to social and performance situations. I've tried many different drugs and have never been sure that they worked. Then I was prescribed Neurontin, and I can 100% feel the difference. My anxiety has decreased significantly on this drug. It sedates me nicely to the point that I'm still completely alert and myself, but I'm so much more easygoing and relaxed. My physical symptoms related to anxiety are still there but I feel less anxious about them, if that makes sense. It just makes the world much more bearable. There are some negative side effects - such as low sex drive, dizziness (which went away after taking for a few weeks), and sometimes I get extra teary. But it's not much of a price to pay if it helps with the main demon of anxiety!  Drugs affect everyone differently, but if you think your life is negatively affected by anxiety, it's definitely worth trying.",8,67
Gabapentin,"My doctor put me on Gabapentin due to daily headaches. I felt absolutely wasted for the first 3 weeks. Once that had worn off I cant say it helped my symptoms at all. I had awful nightmares, night sweats and the most intense anxiety Ive ever felt. Im now coming off the drug and its tough. I wouldnt recommend this for a long term fix or at all to be honest. It is different for everyone though.",1,20
Gabapentin,"I was rediagnosed after suicidal behavior had me on a hold. I was placed on 400mg 3x daily. The sleeping medication my doctor wished to have me on was denied by insurance and I began to take an extra dose before bed, making sure my psychiatrist knew I'd improvised. She agreed to change my script since it was working. The difference in my life has been incredible. I feel very little anxiety, my behavior is much less problematic interpersonally, and my productivity is through the roof. I'm also on bupropion 300mg XR. I've had almost no side effects. My cravings for alcohol are gone. I'm actually living for the first time in my adult life. The only thing that worries me is the possibility of withdrawal symptoms but it's worth the risk considering the effect it's had.",10,55
Gabapentin,"Took 300mg gabapentin one time for panic attacks and anxiety. My psychiatrist prescribes this to use when anxious symptoms became severe. After several hours I do feel that it helped my anxiety briefly, however I became very drowsy. Once falling asleep I slept very well! Better than most nights. I did wake up around 3am with tremors and hot flashes. My anxiety was full blown and I debated whether to take a Xanax to calm myself down because it was so severe. Made me feel very dizzy, hot, anxious, and made my muscles tense. The rest of the morning I had increased anxiety compared to normal. I will not be taking again. Many reviews state it helped people and wish I could have been so lucky.",1,25
Gabapentin,"I was prescribed neurontin for pudendal neuralgia. I gradually increased from 100 mg three times daily to 300 mg 3x a day. I also take 60 mg duloxetine and 20 mg buspar 2x daily. While my neuralgia didnt improve, it left me feeling great from reduced anxiety. However, I had to discontinue using it because it significantly impaired my ability to drive safely- I had two near car accidents in two days; and it caused major abdominal bloating in the evening. I am extremely disappointed as I felt better emotionally than I have in years.",3,14
Gabapentin,"I started taking gabapentin, 300 mg 3 times a day, about a month ago.  At first it did a lot for my anxiety, although I experienced a lot of side effects:  dizziness, bloating, weight gain.  I was able to cut way back on my ativan use.  However, the last week my anxiety has shot through the roof and I have had to take gabapentin about every two hours instead of four.  The side effects have subsided, though.  I am going to ask my therapist this Friday whether I should increase my dose or try to get off this drug.",5,17
Gabapentin,"I just started Gabapentin 600mg per day. Not sure if the dosage is low but not experiencing the relief I expected. I don't feel dizzy or nauseous like other medications but I still need my Klonopin to ease the panic attacks. I look forward to this new medication. I'll keep you updated in the near future. By the way, the optimal dose for anxiety is 900 to 1,800mg. But if a lower dose helps you then stick with it. Good Luck to everyone. I hope you find relief from anxiety.",9,37
Gabapentin,"gabapentin works differently for everyone. I took it for anxiety but only  temporarily because of concentration issues. I took 100mg every 6 hours and it helped me for a while. Currently, my anxiety is under control, but my mood is down. A combo of an antidepressant and gabapentin is a perfect match, but it doesn't work for everyone. It will either work or won't. The great thing about this medication is that you don't have to wait several weeks for it to work. It usually works immediately but if your anxiety is high then give it at least a week and at the right dosage for it to work. Some people can handle 300mg and some people need 1,800mg to be effective. Give it a chance before quitting.",8,44
Gabapentin,I wasted time with talk therapy and antidepressants.  Then by chance  I took gabapentin for pain when I got shingles.  I noticed that my generalized anxiety went away.  I also sleep a lot better.  I take 200 mg in the morning and 200mg at night.  I had to get used to it - it made me feel fuzzy brained at first. Before gabapentin  I used to like to have a cocktail to calm my nerves.  Now drinking alcohol doesn't even sound good.  I feel calm.  Why isn't this prescribed more?  I had to ask for it.,9,84
Gabapentin,"This definitely helps my social anxiety. Sometimes I don't want to shut up! (lol) However, I don't believe that this will help people with SEVERE anxiety and depression. Anti-depressants would probably work better. I think Gabapentin is more for people who have social anxiety disorder, at least through my experience. It also helps me with my alcohol cravings. My psychiatrist in rehab prescribed me Gaba 2 years ago and I've been on it ever since. I take 600-900mg a day.",9,40
Gabapentin,gabapentin has been excellent for anxiety,10,33
Gabapentin,"Started off at 300mg 3 x a day for anxiety, depression and insomnia. Didnt really do much at that level so the psychiatrist increased it to 400mg 3x a day and then upped it to 400mg 4x a day. I used to be on lorazepam for anxiety but stopped taking that because of the side effects. I can tell you with 100% confidence that Im feeling better on Gabapentin than anything Ive ever been prescribed for anxiety and depression. Ive also been sleeping through the night uninterrupted, which I havent been able to do for the past 20 years. This stuff works people, as long as its at the right dose for your personal needs.",10,108
Gabapentin,Gabapentin is fantastic for anxiety,9,53
Gabapentin,"This medication gabapentin has been AMAZING for my panic disorder. Within two days of starting gabapentin 300mg x 3 daily I saw incredible improvement. I have had my middle of the day dosage upped to 900mg only because that is when I experience the most anxiety. Only downfall is withdrawal symptoms. I went a couple of days without due to not being able to get my prescription filled and the withdrawal was awful. Shaking, chills, confusion, etc. If you do choose to get off of the medication, follow your doctor's directions and taper off gradually.",10,54
Gabapentin,"Tried gabapentin at several doses for anxiety. Felt nothing from the 100mg/3x day that my doctor started me at, so we upped it 200mg/3x day. I couldn't tell for certain whether it was making anxiety worse or still having no effect until we upped it to 300mg/3x day when I knew that it was making me feel spacey, disconnected and overall more anxious and unable to focus and think straight.",5,41
Gabapentin,"I'll give gabapentin a 5 because it works insanely good for my neuropathic pain, but for my anxiety I don't know. I just can't find the right dosage. I've been on everything from 1200mg to 600mg. 600mg worked well for about three months, but suddenly 600mg stopped working and is now giving me anxiety. I tried to up the dose, but it didn't work. Now I'm trying to lower the dosage, but it also gives me anxiety. I'm tired of not getting the right dose. It is a lot of anxiety and it feels pretty hopeless. I'm now gonna try to taper down slowly to about 300mg's because I see a lot of people that use it for anxiety at that dose. I just want minimal pain and to be calm...",5,26
Gabapentin,"I had a nervous breakdown (lots of anxiety and depression), ended up in the ER and was given gabapentin three X 100 mg a day (about 2 months ago). It worked immediately; with in an hour of my first dose I had a big appetite (had lost 10 pounds), a big mood lift and a boost in energy. The side effects (grogginess and confusion) were gone in less than a week.  It worked really well for about a month and then I felt it starting to wear off. My pdoc doesn't believe higher doses will benefit me so need to find something else.  I agree with others that the effects wear off after a while and bigger doses may be needed, but I really liked it and it worked very well for depression where my other meds (ativan and propanolol) did not.  Even though I feel it's worn off, I am still not as bad as I was (I believe it is still helping somewhat). Overall, it worked well for me but it may not be a good option if something long-term is needed.",9,48
Gabapentin,"Eh. I tell myself it works, so I think that helps. Psych scared of anti-anxiety meds so he scripts anticonvulsants off label. Seems to work better PRN. If I take it on a regular basis I get fatigued and shaky. This drug relieves my anxiety as much as Benadryl, without causing the sleepiness so that's a plus. Seems to help in acute social situations to take the edge off. I think it helps my chronic back pain a bit, but that could be my imagination. I give it a 6 because side-effects are mild, the drug is cheap, safe, and at my disposal.",6,27
Gabapentin,"Gabapentin was prescribed for my anxiety, was also suffering from depression at the time. Experienced near instant  relief after first 100 mg dose kicked in. Good stuff.",10,66
Gabapentin,"After several years of taking increasing doses of several other anti-depressants with diminishing results, my psychiatrist diagnosed me with treatment-resistant/atypical depression (along with the anxiety). I was kept on Wellbutrin, and gabapentin and remeron were added in. It was one wild ride. I felt so loopy and out of it, but I felt completely emotionally dead and empty. It was quite scary. I spent an hour once just slowly pacing my hallway and then staring into space. They cut my dosage, but the side effects were still just too much. Once I cut the gabapentin completely, the side effects were gone.",0,28
Gabapentin,"Gabapentin is great! 300mg x2 daily All my anxiety is gone, the pain on my neck, shoulders and legs as well. Finally, I found the right medication after trying so many different prescription's for my anxiety. I give it a solid 10!",10,90
Gabapentin,It only kinda worked the first time I used it but I must say that I think it worked better that time due to the fact that I didn't sleep the night before (as in 0 hours of sleep). I took it again the next day and I didn't feel any different. I was still as tense and as anxious as ever. I wish people would quit demonizing the other pills. Maybe then people like me who really need them could get our hands on them BUT nooo people keep abusing those pills so now you've got all these hurdles people like me gotta get over in order to get a medicine that actually works. Gabapentin isn't very effective at all. For me it did absolutely nothing.,1,43
Gabapentin,"Been on 3600mg past couple years. I read notes of everyone's personal experience with it for anxiety, but I see it's so different for everyone. I have schizoeffective disorder. It helps with the anxiety part and the depressive part, but I can tell it must be noticeable to other's if i'm on it because some acquaintance I've known thru my wife really have dramatically different interaction with me now compared to before I was on this. Very distant to me now. On other hand, it's more important for mySELF. But it has worn off a lot if i take it every day. I'm so depressed during those periods. It's a trough. Would be even less depressed if I wasn't on it at all, but then I would not have the up swings with it either. It's very difficult to manage it.",0,18
Gabapentin,"If there is one word to describe this drug, it would be 'HORRIBLE'! I am taking 100 mg of this gabapentin poison twice a day and the side effects are not like anything that I have EVER experienced before. Insomnia, anxiety, visual disturbances and nightmares when I do sleep. I just stay in my room on the bed night and day. Concentration loss and have lost all interest in everything. I attempted to stop taking it and the withdrawal started 14 hours after my last dose. When I call the DR, he tells me these symptoms are not from the poison. WHAT! They started a few days after I started it. Some how, some way, I must stop this vile substance.",1,29
Gabapentin,"Been on gabapentin for over 10 years.  It helps with certain parts of anxiety, mainly tension and irritability.  However, and I swear some Psychs don't get this, you have to take it religiously every 4-5 hours for it to work.  If I got past that mark, my shoulders and back tense up, everything annoys me, and I start to hate everything.  Sounds tough, but it hasn't affected my organs negatively, and when taken properly, it works.",9,64
Gabapentin,"I think its helping. Hard to say, as I am on a lot of other meds that are helping me feel better. Either way, Im not vomiting from anxiety anymore and I can eat  so it mustve done something!",8,24
Gabapentin,"I first started Gabapentin to address severe anxiety and depression as well as a drinking problem. At first this drug was a miracle. for about a year-and-a-half I told everybody that this drug saved my life. I wasn't drinking, it had reduced depression, and almost no anxiety. However, over time I started to notice that if I didn't take the medication within four or five hours of my last dose I would have temporary withdrawal. This includes sweats, extreme irritability and anxiety, and an inability to focus. As mentioned in many other posts, it does very noticeably affect your memory. So while immediately helpful, in the long-term I have developed a dependency on this drug and experience withdrawal symptoms on a day-to-day basis which is difficult to manage. I've been on this drug for over 2 years, with all different dosages, and I want to get off it now. It is an amazing temporary fix but leads to dependency and other mental stress.",6,53
Gabapentin,"I have been originally on only 300mg to help me sleep about 3 years ago. I did help a bit. But since then, I've been on about 3200mg per day past couple years. I usually end up taking most of that if I have to go somewhere, like a public place such as a house event etc..almost anything really. It doesn't last nearly as long as it did in the beginning. Now, about 2 hours or slightly more and it seems done. After that I start feeling depression and anxiety creep in. I take the other remainder at night but even that's not enough now to help me sleep. I get zero sleep. Probably an hour per WEEK past many years actually. Sounds impossible but it's true. I'm wide awake all night. I have always had that though, but the anxiety caused by the temporary withdrawal of the Gabapentin doesn't help I'm sure.",0,25
Gabapentin,Took them to feel good at first really helped me. Being in recovery it got me threw a lot of hard times thinking about getting high on heroin it pushed me threw to stay off dope another day. But recently I took them one sat night as usual and I started getting these weird jolts and uncontrollable movements ultimately ended up having a seizure in the hospital. Now I cant take them any more the make me feel weird and uncomfortable to the point where it puts me in a anxiety attack. I do not recommend them for anyone horrible drug used for the wrong reasons. One 300mg a day is it nothing more. .....just my experience,0,18
Gabapentin,"I would give gabapentin a higher rating when it comes to nerve damage but for anxiety, I dont notice it doing a single thing. Ive been taking  this along with opioids for chronic pain for awhile and we tried upping it and decreasing benzos for anxiety but it never helped me with anxiety. Ill stick to the benzos. But try this before a benzo please!",2,16
Gabapentin,"I have just started taking gabapentin for anxiety.  It took less than a week for me to start feeling better on this drug. It seems to have completely removed my anxiety. Here is the weird part... I am only using gabapentin at a 100 mg dose and it works for anxiety.   I have to state though, I take high dose of Cymbalta (90mg dose) and Adderall (40mg dose) Those two drugs take care of my depression and lack of focus. So maybe that is why I am responding so well to such a small dose of gabapentin. I am supposed to go up another  100 mg in a few days. I may wait stay at this dosage for a while and see if it continues to work for me.",0,27
Gabapentin,"My doctor tried gabapentin along with 60 mg Cymbalta for my severe anxiety/panic disorder. On 300 mg per day, I could not keep my eyes open and kept nodding off. It did not help my anxiety it just made me feel sleepy and spaced out like I was on morphine or heroin. I could not work, drive, or function at all on this drug. I nearly wrecked my car and people thought I was on drugs. However, the same combination helped my mom tremendously with her depression and neuropathy. She had no side effects.",1,24
Gabapentin,"I have been on gabapentin for roughly 2 years and it has helped me, I have bipolar disorder and nothing had worked. I was constantly depressed. So my doctor put me on this. I also take Pristiq which is also good. I am also on lamatrigine. This is a great combination. At the beginning I was loopy but after my body got used to it I was living my life like everyone else.",10,30
Gabapentin,"Id been on Gabapentin a few times in the past for anxiety. This time they gave it to me for bipolar?!! Im struggling with this, taking 2400mg (top dose) mg/day. My memory is gone. Long term memory fine, short term gone. I cant sit and watch TV without extreme anxiety, getting up every 10 min, crossing and uncrossing legs, squirming. I had to get an excuse from jury duty saying I was unfit. .. all I can do is wager this time against the last times and remember how hard it was for me to even cook a meal, how it would take me 3 hours. Now I dont cook at all. Im too exhausted all the time. But coming off of it I feel extremely depressed (lay in bed ALL day) unable to sleep, etc. This drug also causes pancreatic cancer. Which my father in law died from. Help me get off this mess!!!! Im trapped.",1,22
Gabapentin,"Gabapenin let's me LIVE LIFE!! I have HORRIBLE social anxiety, it has made me miss many important moments in my sons life because I get too scared and nervous to leave the house.  Xanax and klonopin both helped to a small degree, but it was still hard for me to do simple things like go to a store.  Then my doctor prescribed me gabapentin and all I can say is it is AMAZING for social anxiety!   I highly, highly recommend to anyone with social anxiety.  It changed my life.",10,89
Gabapentin,"I was prescribed 100mg 4x per day for anxiety and  it worked at first. Then needed higher dosages, then came the side effects  of loss of memory, confusion, suicidal ideations and physical dependency.  I lost my job because I can't keep up with the pace of work and the increased depression. The withdrawals trying to taper off it are horrible. If there is another option rather than gabapentin I would consider it.",3,22
Gabapentin,"At first I thought gabapentin was great, it seemed like it was helping with my anxiety and I had zero urge to drink alcohol for the first time in forever.  Only problem is that after a few months I turned into a ZOMBIE!  I felt foggy all the time.  I had trouble waking up in the morning and always felt like I had this nasty headache.  It got hard for me to remember things; I could have conversation with someone and not remember what it was about an hour later.  I had to stop taking it because it was affecting my work; I was constantly spacing things and forgetting to, y'know, do my job.  The withdrawal was BAD. I experienced increased anxiety and feeling creepy-crawly sensation on my skin for several days.  Wish it worked out better for me because the original effects were great.",0,26
Gabapentin,"I have been on gabapentin for almost a month now. I am clinically diagnosed with PTSD, and major depressive disorder. I have had a very traumatic child so of course I suffer with anxiety related to PTSD. I cannot function in my day to day life without medication and I have to accept that.  Along with gabapentin 100mg 3 times daily for anxiety, I also take celexa for depression, Prazosin, and Trazodone for nightmares and sleep. My doctor is resistant to benzodiapenes, though I feel I need them, never been an addict. I have tried Busbar and vistaril with no luck. Doc suggestion gabapentin. When I take it within the hour I feel relaxed and my thought process slows down. I had had racing thoughts daily before this. I am not crippled in my day to day life with anxiety that prevents me from functioning. I do feel like I could benefit from higher dose as I feel like my body is adjusting to the medication and not giving me the effect it originally had the first week. But all in all, I have no complaints.",0,35
Gabapentin,"Gabapentin has really helped my anxiety and alcohol over use, and not addictive like Xanax. Helps my insomnia as well",10,31
Gabapentin,"Weak orgasms and loss of self. I was given 200mg for anxiety, depression, and partial seizures. For two weeks I felt like I was in a dark place and felt dull. I wouldn't recommend.",1,22
Gabapentin,"Gabapentin made me cry uncontrollably - I was on it for my anxiety. It gave me dark  thoughts and I felt buzzed,  weak, drained, and a worthless feeling. I almost ended up in the psychiatric hospital.",1,36
Gabapentin,"I was originally put in this drug to get off of benzodiazepines. I realized it was helpful with my anxiety somewhat as well. My doctor decided it may be in my best interest to continue taking this medication for a while. Unfortunately I started to have severe swelling in the abdomen and insane water retention in my hands, face, and neck. I put on about 15 lbs in a matter of two and a half months, which ultimately led to me coming off of this medication. Within the first 24 to 48 hours my body was in full blown water ridden.",3,19
Gabapentin,"I usually rate medications low because of side effects and non-ease of use. However, I am very impressed with this medication.  It goes in, does what it is needed for and didnt impair me to where I was non functional which has been the case with a lot of other medications for me. Gabawesome!",9,43
Gabapentin,"My doctor suggested I get off Klonopin and he put me on Gabapentin. It has helped tremendously with anxiety before bedtime. The best way I can describe it is I suddenly feel calm and dreamy and like I can turn my mind off and finally stop over thinking. Much in the way a benzodiazepine would make me feel, but without feeling too dizzy or like I'm losing my memory. Another thing it has helped with is to slow down my drinking. I use to drink before bedtime to help me fall asleep (which has its side effects, but I felt it was better than tossing and turning all night)... The Gabapentin actually turns off that craving somehow and I don't desire any sort of drink before bed. I also somehow quit smoking. The one thing I can tell you Gabapentin does NOT work with are things like panic attacks. Taking a Gabapentin during a panic attack will probably do nothing, in comparison to a benzodiazepine. It will reduce anxiety in a more general sense though.",9,60
Gabapentin,"This drug changed my life . I have had terrible anxiety my whole life which was followed by depression. SSRI's had little effect. I finished my degree and actually got a job.  For anxiety you need a higher dose , I started with 100mg x 3 and worked up to 1800mg a day, the sweet spot.  Few things I will warn others , the withdraw is pretty bad . I ran out 3 days before refill and begged the pharamacist to refill it 2 days early. As well , sometimes its difficult to get a good erection. My  psychiatrist gave me wellbrutin to counter that effect.  Genertic brand warning - auro gabapentin is a terrible , low effectiveness.  Apo is what I'm on.",9,26
Gabapentin,"I have taken many SSRIs, tricyclics, etc. that didnt help depression or anxiety.  Cognitive behavioral helped and  klonopin worked moderately, and thats all that worked.  I started Gabapentin at 100 mg 3 x a day.  I immediately noticed improvement and it also helped me feel more like not staying up late like I always do.  Klonopin is very helpful if you cant find relief in SSRIs &amp; you dont have addictions, but for the first time Im hopeful that this Gabapentin might work. If it works even better at a higher dose Ill give it 10 stars. The only other thing that helped me a lot was l-methyl-folate.  I have the MTHFR gene mutation and the l-metal folate worked, but I had a side affect every time I took it.  I found a doctor that might be able to get rid of the side effect.  So after 40 years I now have 2 drugs other than klonopin that give me some hope.   SSRIs give me bad side effects but no positive results.",7,25
Gabapentin,"Completely ended my depression.  Also lets me sleep soundly.  Taking 600mg x3 a day.  Only slight side effects for the first two days - felt tired and a little loopy, but nothing that concerned me.  The depression I had was absolutely crippling.  No other medicine I tried even touched it.  Gabapentin completely took it away.  I feel incredible!",10,66
Gabapentin,"I tried this several years ago. 300mg, then 600mg, then 900mg a day in divided doses. I helps with nerve pain, but I had horrible dreams that led to anxiety which I was already having problems with, so it got worse. The dreams became so vivid I started wondering if they were dreams or actually happened and I just thought they were a dream. I'm not Bipolar, don't suffer from clinical depression, but do have GAD from chronic pain. Maybe I can try it again at lower doses, say start at 100mg once a day, then twice, then three times. I'm on clonazepam now 2mg X 2 a day for atypical facial neuralgia and anxiety due to a crushed trigeminal nerve and other pain issues including arthritis. I have tried EVERY medical pain option out there. Clonazepam works, but I am afraid it will lose it's potency over time. I run, lift weights, cycle, watch my diet and am in excellent general health at 60+.",2,12
Gabapentin,Taking 500mg three times a day.  I was a complete mess before this miracle drug.  Now I no longer have anxiety or depression.  I have my life back.  It's amazing,10,59
Gabapentin,"Diagnosed bipolar and put on Lamictal. 1st panic attack sent me to ER at age 27. Had anxiety for 2 years. Doctor added Lexapro which eliminated all anxiety and panic attacks. In 2017 I had another panic attack that sent me to ER. My panic attacks felt like I was going to pass out and die. Doctor switched me to Paxil (40 mg) &amp; Klonopin (1.5 mg) and continued to take Lamictal (300 mg). I continued to have milder panic attacks and anxiety which felt like I was being choked. I tried Buspar but didn't help. My doctor mentioned gabapentin so I came across this forum and gave it a shot. My doctor started me on 100mg 3 X's a day and I am 260 lbs. It totally eliminated all anxiety and panic. I can drive, live life without fear of having a panic attack or dealing with daily anxiety. There are zero side effects for me. I am off the Klonopin and carry it with me just in case. I eliminated ALL caffeine from my diet. Gabapentin has been a miracle drug for me and I hope it helps you too.",10,74
Gabapentin,"I was on Benzodiazepines for forty years. I found a psychiatrist to help me get off. I was also in pain from a spine injury. I have a good spine doctor and he worked with the psychiatrist. They thought gabapentin would serve a two fold purpose for nerve pain and anxiety and withdrawal. It worked. I took gabapentin for almost a year and I stopped for six months. I can't say I experienced any bad side effects from stopping but the nerve pain was back and withdrawal from Klonapin increased. I got into a funk and low grade depression and had existential crisis and felt detached from everything. I decided to try gabapentin again and I have to say it turned my situation around. It's been eight months and I'm doing much better with both anxiety and nerve pain. For me the benefits far outweigh any side effects which are minimal for me. I am much calmer, feel normal, not emotionally detached and beleaguered. I can't say that I have experienced any of the horror stories I've read.",10,50
Gabapentin,After dealing with anxiety and depression for many years I started taking Gabapentin it is the best medication I have tried yet for anxiety tension and overall pain. I have been able to do so much while taking it.,10,46
Gabapentin,"It seems to be helping somewhat at 900 mg a day. I wish more folks here would specify the dosage. A lot of posts seem to be enthusiastic about this drug but I'd like to know how much to take - beyond the 900 mg's to feel a more profound, lasting effect",7,34
Gabapentin,I started taking gabapentin for anxiety and it changed my life. It gave me a level of control in my life I never experienced before.,10,53
Gabapentin,"Hello Everone, Took forever to find a current forum on this drug  - this one is great. My Dr. prescribed me Gabapentin for about the past 3 months and I've been skipping several days a week because I'm worried to death from what I've read everywhere, that it wears off in time. My days that I don't  take it are very bad. Once I start daily, that's it, no turning back again. I don't want to face withdrawal when the time comes if won't continue working in 5 months, or 3 years etc. Just scared and so worried, that's why I am saving days for it to work well. If anyone here has searched like me, the internet is 95% nothing but very bad news on this medication. I don't know what to do..confused.",0,23
Gabapentin,"Amazing drug for anxiety, especially social anxiety. Whenever I take gabapentin I'm able to go out and socialize without problems. I've been taking this for 6 years. I never had any luck with any other drug, and I've tried so many. The only side affect I get with gabapentin is if you don't take it consistently you will get really depressed and angry. At least I do.",10,58
Gabapentin,"Wow this medication is a lifesaver. It got me off Klonopin instantly. It did something unusual for me. I have Bipolar disorder type 2 and depression has just been my daily thing. This medication not only took away anxiety it completely took the depression away. I am on lamictal too. I have been on so many medications its scary. None of them working. This one has just sucked away my depression as if it never existed. I am amazed and even though I dislike medication, this one is a miracle. I take 1800 mg divided three times a day",10,42
Gabapentin,Saved my life. That's all I can say. I feel human again.,10,53
Gabapentin,"I first starting taking this medicine in summer of 2017 for anxiety and panic disorder to help me from taking so much klonopin.  I took 300mg 4x a day.   To be honest it did help for a while but I think it's just because it was making me high.  I know it doesn't directly affect gaba but it helps you detatch so you of course feel better. Over time it will lose its potency though and I just ended up more depressed  on it because it is a depressive drug.  Since January 2018, I have been tapering down from 4 a day to almost just one 300mg per day and I've lost 20 lbs and my suicidal thoughts have been drastically reduced.  I think this medication is probably good for short term use but overall not healthy to use for psychological reasons alone if you are prone to depressive thoughts or suicidal ideation.",4,29
Gabapentin,Works better for my anxiety than klonopin and xanax.  Also puts me in a generally better mood.,10,50
Gabapentin,"I have been on gabapentin for years. I have severe withdrawals. I stopped taking it for awhile, thinking Im addicted, I went back on it because I wasnt doing anything. Just watching TV All day. Now I swim, walk, take care of dogs, etc. I realized it helps me with anxiety and depression.",0,43
Gabapentin,"Took 300mgs of Gabapentin today at 10:29am. Got really dizzy and my mouth felt a bit puffed up. But, I did not have that much anxiety. My anxiety makes my throat feel like it's going to close but when I took the gabapentin, I felt a lot better and now, at 5pm, my throat feels fine, my pain is gone and you know I feel a lot better. Supposed to be taking it 3 times a day. But, I am VERY scared of taking meds. But, once I found out gabapentin is a neurotransmitter and calms your nervous system, I felt better. Tired too. Maybe might get some sleep finally.",6,29
Gabapentin,I have been on this medicine for 3 year's. I take 3200mg daily in divided doses.  I was put on it after I lost my husband to suicide in front of me.,10,56
Gabapentin,"Hey Im Troy I live in California. I dont know where to start so Ill just tell you what Ive been through and how this medication helped me. Ive been bullied since grade 5 about a multitude of things. My whole life (so far) Ive always felt different. Like I see things a lot differently than other people and I suffer from existential anxiety and severe anxiety. Always wondering why were here how we got here whats the meaning of life blah blah blah. Anyways, you get my point and maybe you even relate to me. Ive tried a bunch of medications to help me like: hydroxyzine, lexapro, abilify, adderall, strattera, Wellbutrin and a lot more I cant remember atm. Anyways Gabapentin - after taking it for two days has already changed my thoughts, and my actions this medication makes me feel extremely happy, outgoing, at ease, and just overall fine. My thoughts no longer take control of me and drive me insane. Thank you Neurontin.",10,114
Gabapentin,"You definitely feel weird and spaced out for a few days but that will go away once your body gets used to it.  I was prescribed 300mg 3X a day for pain. I also take OxyContin and Norco. It changed my whole life. My pain dr didnt know about the years I have suffered with PTSD, GAD and severe tension. To the point where my muscles in my upper back, shoulders, neck and back of my head, including my jaw would tense so much that I had constant headaches. So severe that I would vomit. This went on for years. I tried EVERYTHING! So little did I know that when dr added gabapentin, it would change everything. I got my first 8 hr sleep in over 20 years. It helped with all the pain. I started going for walks, cleaning my house and doing projects again. I feel amazing! So please give it a chance to work. I know it feels weird and icky for a few days but that does go away. Dont give up.",10,67
Gabapentin,"On 400mg three times a day.  Feel wonderful, but not drugged.  I feel normal.  No more anxiety or depression and I sleep 7 to 8 hours a night.  For the people saying gabapentin isn't working for them: it could be because your dose is too low.  I started at 100mg three times a day and it did nothing.  Went up to 300mg three times a day and felt better, but still anxious and wasn't sleeping well.  Went up to 400mg three times a day and it's working wonderfully.  Don't give up.  It's all about finding the right dose for you.  Some people need  a bigger dose three times a day to see results.  Plus, it took about a month before I noticed the full results of the drug.",10,45
Gabapentin,"My psychiatrist put me on it to help me sleep.  I have severe depression, anxiety, OCD and PTSD.  I am a veteran.  I have been on it for almost three months now, and I could not figure out what was wrong with me.  I do have occasional bouts of anger, but my anger issues have gotten out of control.  I find myself screaming and yelling at strangers, not to mention flipping drivers off.  In addition, I am having memory loss that is worse than before, and it does not help me sleep at all.  My depression is also 10 times worse.  I am just waiting to be assigned to a new VA (I just moved), and get off this stuff safely.  I take 900 mg a day (300 mg x 3 a night) for insomnia.",2,20
Gabapentin,"I've had really severe anxiety for over 10 years.  I've been prescribed Xanax,  Klonopin, antihistamines, etc.  The benzos somewhat worked.  Anything else didn't touch it.   When I say severe anxiety I mean tremors through my whole body,  fainting, shortness of breath, the works..  Finally,  someone suggested I try gabapentin.  It was the best decision I have ever made.   Since I've been taking 800mg twice a day  my whole life has changed.  I'm happy all the time, (I also suffer from depression and am currently taking an antidepressant that I can't spell lol), I have 50x more patience with my two young children,  I have motivation to get things done, I keep busy all day rather than moping around and avoiding the world.   This medication has changed my life and I highly recommend it to anyone who is suffering from severe anxiety or depression.",10,53
Gabapentin,"Somewhat effective. I was taking Klonopin for a few years, and was switched over. Gabapentin is very weak compared to Klonopin. I take 300mg 3x a day.",3,8
Gabapentin,I took Gabapentin 300mg at night and found it made me drowsy so l had to go to bed by 9pm. I woke up having after having awful bad dreams and anxiety for hours so I dumped the pills in the trash. What garbage! Don't ever take this before driving or at work!,2,15
Gabapentin,"I absolutely love gabapentin. I was originally prescribed this for generalized anxiety disorder, but actually, it hits a few things on me at once. It calms my anxiety, helps my essential tremor, and soothes my restless legs syndrome. It's an essential and beneficial CNS med that I will happily take forever if need be. I do not experience any side effects whatsoever, although there was some dizziness when I first started taking it. I take 1800 mg per day.",10,41
Gabapentin,"I've had terrible depression and anxiety for over 20 years.  I was prescribed Paxil in 1995 and it worked great until last year.  It just stopped working and I had horrible rebound depression, anxiety, panic attacks and insomnia.  I felt really bad.. My CNP prescribed Gabapentin and I felt better after the first dose.  I take 300mg three times a day and feel wonderful.  No more anxiety, depression, constant worrying and it works great for insomnia.  The first night I took it, I slept 8 hours straight.  I haven't slept that well in over 30 years.  I had a few side effects such as slight dizziness and brain fog , but it passed in a few days. What's so great about it is it doesn't make me feel drugged.  I just feel calm, clear-headed and relaxed.  I can focus on the important things in my life and stop needlessly worrying about things such as what if I can't sleep tonight?  What if I go into Walmart and have a panic attack?. What if, what if.. This drug is truly a life saver for me.",10,77
Gabapentin,I suffer from anxiety and severe PTSD. I was on Benzos for a long time but like so many was taken off due to long term risks. Gabapentin has taken care of my anxiety and traumatic flashbacks. A lot of my trauma was physical so I'll go through days where my entire body is in pain just out of cell memory. Gabapentin relieves the pain for me and helps me to stay in the present. The only side effect for me is extreme paranoia if I take more than 100mgs a day. I'm tiny and very sensitive to medication so low doses are more effective. I also take Lamictal daily which helps to counter any paranoia. This is just me though but I wanted to share my own experience. I was really apprehensive on trying Gabapentin because of all the scary reviews I read but I'm so happy I went on it. Everyone's brain chemistry is different. It's all about finding the right one for you.,10,32
Gabapentin,"I had great results with gabapentin. I am currently only on one drop a day. I am very sensitive to psychotropic drugs. So I asked for the liquid version. I am going to slowly increase my dose over time. It has lessened my anxiety and helped insomnia. Improved mood also.    Im afraid that some start on a big dose, have a reaction, then disregard the drug. It can be a reaction that your body is getting accustomed to the drug. Not that you cannot tolerate the drug. Obviously this wouldnt apply to allergic, anaphylactic reactions.     This wouldnt apply for epilepsy bc you need a standard dose. My issue is anxiety. So I dont absolutely have to have the drug. It helps for anxiety tho.",8,14
Gabapentin,"I was put on gabapentin as a last resort to my anxiety. I have not been able to function in society. I am a disabled veteran. I am in my second week now, and I am getting worried. I am so tired, but I can't sleep. I am not joking, I haven't slept for days now. I have dipped into extreme depression, and now I have uncontrollable shaking and twitching. I guess this is my entry to this med, and it really hurts. I am in contact about this situation with my med profs. They said it will take time for my body to adjust. For now though, I am very worried, this is not me.",5,25
Gabapentin,Fantastic. Felt great and anxiety free the morning after taking it the previous evening.  Loads of energy. Did a lot of things that I previously had not done for a good while. Asked friends if they thought I might be high or euphoric  and they said no.,10,34
Gabapentin,"Been on Gabapentin past couple years for anxiety and social phobia. Recently, increased to 300mg three times per day. I've read everywhere about the withdrawal symptoms of it. It scares me a lot! I have been trying to take it every OTHER day but on the following day after, I really do feel depressed and anxiety is so bad, I can't leave my house.  A day later it lifts, and I start all over again. Does anyone else do it this way? I really am hesitant about taking it every day and having to one day perhaps face serious consequences of quitting it.",0,11
Gabapentin,"I have anxiety, pretty much generalized, that kicks my butt every couple years. It is bad and if it hangs around long enough I get very depressed. Insomnia too. I recently retired to a more rural coastal community and had to find a new Psychiatrist. I did but waited too long to see him. I was a wreck by the time I walked into his office for the first time.  Anyway, I had been taking Ativan prescribed by my GP but it wasnt working much and of course it can cause bounce back anxiety. My New Doc prescribed Gabapentin. He started me on baby doses of 100mg a day. I am now taking 100mg in am. 100mg mid day and 300mg at night. I feel so much better. I have not been taking any Ativan at all. No side effects except maybe a little euphoric. For sleep he prescribed Remeron which also did the trick and is not habit forming.",9,20
Gabapentin,"The only thing Gabapentin did for me was make me a zombie. It gave me horrible problems with balance, memory, and blurred vision. I also had a major problem finding words. My old doc refuses to hear it and would yell at me when I mentioned the gabapentin giving me side effects. I mentioned everything to my new doc and he decided to wean me off of the gabapentin and onto Ativan three times daily as well as a supplement called L-Theanine three times daily. The weaning process took about a week (I was taking 600mg gabapentin 3xD). I have never felt calmer, more sane, and more relaxed!! All of this without any balance, vision, or speech problems! Gabapentin is garbage! So glad to be free at last!",1,17
Gabapentin,First day on Gabapentin first dose felt awesome. On 100mg 3x a day. Took second doing well! I finally hope and pray my feeling awesome continues.,8,23
Gabapentin,Just started  to take for anxiety. No side effects noted.,0,19
Gabapentin,"I take 200 MG three times a day for Social and Generalized anxiety disorder, along with occasional panic. It works very well. I tried SSRI antidepressants before, but couldnt handle the side effects. Gabapentin works great!",10,33
Gabapentin,"I suffer from anxiety and was prescribed this versus my previous medication of Lexapro which didnt work for me at all. Within two days of taking this new medication gabapentin, I was almost in tears because of how spacey and uncomfortable I was. I was prescribed only 100mg to take once per night. I woke up the next morning feeling extremely spaced out and I felt stoned even though I wasnt. I couldnt process my thoughts correctly, I was forgetting how to do simple tasks and even losing short term memory when someone asked me to do job related tasks. I felt my eyes were very sleepy even though I had plenty of rest. While this helped ease my anxiety I noticed I was paranoid and noticed everything around me amplified. I was only on this medication for two days but thats all I needed to make me realize this wasnt helping me whatsoever.",2,10
Gabapentin,"My Doctor took me off a drug I have used for the last 5 years and put me on Gabapentin. This is just terrible made me feel worse  as I had all the side affects. Worst mistake ever to be on this if you have depression, anxiety,  can't sleep - this all intensified in me!!!  My Dr  didn't go over any side affects with me at all and my mistake for not asking  - a Big mistake!!! I was just a mess on this medication  I could not stop shaking, every thing got worse!! This is not something I ever want to go though again or see anyone else go though.",1,12
Gabapentin,"Gabapentin has changed my life! I've suffered from anxiety for over 15 years and have tried everything. I've been to many doctors and tried paxil, effexor, Zoloft, buspar, Attivan, and clonazepam. Antidepressants did not help me at all. The stronger drugs helped at first but my anxiety overwhelmed the drugs unless I was on a high dose and was just out of it. I didn't know what to do until a psychiatrist put me on gabapentin 300mg x3 daily. I can now live and do things almost like a normal person! Not one panic attack since I've started this medication(I was having them 2-3 tines a week.) At first I would get a little dizzy but it went away after a few days. If you are feeling hopeless please ask your doctor to try this medication. I'm so glad I have found it. I believe this drug could help a lot of people with anxiety!!",10,51
Gabapentin,It's the only medication that works for me long term. I've had side effects with every medication besides Neurontin.,10,23
Gabapentin,"I have SEVERE PTSD from finding my Husband dead. Emergency services worked on him for 45 minutes.  This left me with severe anxiety, I was on Xanax for over a year. I've gone on gabapentin for extreme pain in my neck &amp; back. I just looked up gabapentin for anxiety because I've noticed that I haven't been panicked at all since I've started taking it. I thought, if this isn't being prescribed for anxiety, it should be. Low &amp; behold, it is.  My Dr wanted to start me on 300mg 3 times a day, but I asked for the lowest dose due to med sensitivity. I was prescribed 100mg 3 times a day. I've never felt better. I usually don't even take a 3rd pill. Pain I've been dealing w &amp; taking thousands of mgs of other meds to attempt to relieve, is just gone.  As if that wasn't enough, I'm no longer panicked? My mind is just blown. I don't know if I'll have negative side effects, but w this level of quality of life being restored, I assume that any side effect may be well worth it. Miracle drug",10,38
Gabapentin,"Just started this prescription for anxiety. After taking it, it almost felt like a body buzz. I felt great. Zoned in, felt like I was moving at a better pace instead of slow and not engaged. My anxiety was the lowest I have felt in years. It was so relaxing to not feel anxious.",0,25
Gabapentin,"I  had an addiction problem for over 30yrs and when I finally came to my senses and wanted to stop methadone and subutex, I was prescribed Gabapentin,  I suffer from anxiety, depression and have recently been diagnosed as bipolar.  Over the years I have self medicated with everything and anything.  Taking Gabapentin really has been a miracle for me.  I no longer want illicit drugs, I feel relaxed, motivated and for the first time in many years happy.. I take three 300mg three times a day.  It can cause tummy problems and I generally have to take something once a week or so to stop this..  best medication I have ever had.  May not suit everyone",10,29
Gabapentin,"Didnt do much, if anything, for my anxiety. I didnt notice any side effects. I took 300mg 3x a day.",3,7
Gabapentin,"I first took this for nerve pain which worked  awesome but was pleasantly surprised to find  it worked for my anxiety also. About the only drug that ever did anything,  no SSRI's have ever worked for me.",10,29
Gabapentin,"I started taking Gabapentin five years ago for diabetic neuropathy in my feet.  Within a few days it zapped the shooting pains I experienced from the neuropathy.  Little did I realize the amazing effect it had in stablizing my moods.  It was only when I neglected to refill my script for a week (I'm lazy) that I realized what this med does to stablize my moods.  I fell into an absolute funk and couldn't figure out why until I put 2 +2 together.  Got the refill and the world was right again!  I have an overactive brain, and this med calms things down to a manageable pace.  Won't skip that refill again!",10,33
Gabapentin,"Absolutely amazing for dealing with Anxiety altogether, but specifically Social Anxiety. Not to mention Depression. I would have given it 10 stars if it didn't have such a quick tolerance factor. After about 3 consecutive days of taking it, it begins. The symptoms of Anxiety began returning slowly each day until you increase dosage. And that increase is way to frequent. The best way to deal with this down side isn't by increasing dosage every time, as that would take no time to reach unsafe dosages, but to not use it daily. If your going to use it for Anxiety purposes only, then only take it on the days your really struggling. Done this way, then it's a miracle drug for controlling Anxiety. Only side affect I experience is increase appetite",9,31
Gabapentin,"First day taking 300mg finally feel like myself again. After taking Xanax 4mg a day for 5 months, I stopped taking it but suffer from withdraws even after months of not taking Xanax. Ive been dealing with anxiety but this gabapentin made me finally feel like myself again, like before I even took Xanax. I was full of energy and no anxiety and its only first day!",9,21
Gabapentin,"I'm currently taking 3,000mg/day and feel much better about my anxiety. My side effects are minimal but they're there, so be forewarned. I'd recommend this medication to my family and friends for anxiety. My anxiety was uncontrolled with Xanax, ativan, lunesta/Zoloft, etc. I had tried almost everything, even being hospitalized 5 times. Gabapentin is finally what I needed all along.",9,24
Gabapentin,"Tried a bunch of different meds for PTSD and none seemed to work except the few hours Xanax may allow you. When I started GABA I was a bit loopy in the beginning and it was a bit weird. After a couple of weeks it went away and my anxiety went way down, it also seems to be most effective for 8-12 hrs. I take one 300 mg in the morning and one in the latter afternoon. I can see why it might not work for everyone as this is the only one that has worked for me. You have to give it a bit of time and at least for me the only side effect is lower anxiety.",9,14
Gabapentin,I have had varying success with this drug. On one hand it has been a big help. It was able to flick the switch off and bring me out of a very bad GAD and major depressive episode.  But I wonder about the tolerance and how long it will be effective. I use it basically as an emergency tool when Im spiralling down the rabbit hole.,7,10
Gabapentin,Hugely effective for first month. Some tolerance does develop eventually but overall still more effective than anything else I've taken.,10,12
Gabapentin,"I was on Doxepin 100mgs for a year, which worked incredibly for anxiety and insomnia. However, it caused delayed gastric emptying and never ending weight gain, so I ask my psych if I could try gabapentin due to the reviews here. Have been on 200mg/am and 300mg at night for a month, which is a low dose,  but has done nothing for my anxiety. Psych is starting me on Trazodone (again) for the anxiety but wants me to remain on the gabapentin because it does help with hot flashes, RLS, sleep, and surprisingly, controls my agitation. Dr wants to increase it quickly over the next two months to replace the Trileptal that I've been on several years as a mood stabilizer. I definitely think gabapentin has its place as a mood stabilizer for BP patients.",4,4
Gabapentin,"I suffer from depression and anxiety. I have been on Wellbutrin for three years and I love it. It actually helped a little with anxiety as well, but I would have situational panic attacks and although those situations are now past, I do feel low level anxiety most of the time and certain things can send me into a spiral of doomsday thinking, obsessive thoughts and fear. Once one situation passes, its on to something else.  I cant enjoy anything when Im in those cycles. Even a day off from work can be full of anxiety instead of relaxation. My doc prescribed Gabapentin at a low dose (100mg) three times a day. Took first last night and slept ok. Little groggy but coffee solved that. Hoping this works for me like it has for so many here.",0,10
Gabapentin,"This has been the best thing ever for anxiety. I have never been on an anxiety medicine, but my anxiety was getting uncontrollable so my doctor prescribed this. I was a little weary at first, but 3 weeks on this (300 mg/day) has truly changed my life! The little things I used to stress about, I no longer worry about and it also helps with sleep. Wouldn't recommend anything else!",10,32
Gabapentin,"This was a miracle for me!  I was taking alprazolam 3-4 times a day for about 4 years. With the crackdown of controlled substances, my PCP decided to wean me off. I have terrible anxiety. SSRI's do not work for me (too many side effects). After reading the reviews of gabapentin, I asked my PCP if we could try this. AMAZING!!! I no longer wake up shaky and anxious, I don't get that feeling  I used to get when the alprazolam wore off, and I sleep better than ever! I take 300 MG 3-4 times daily. This truly is a life saver for me!",10,27
Gabapentin,I went through a benzodiazepine withdrawal back in 2013 and found that a low dose 200 mg of Gabapebtin helped me back then. I was on benozos 30 years and no longer use them for 4 years straight now. I went off all drugs on principal four years ago but after four years and major anxiety and depression I decided to use Gabapentin starting two weeks ago. It was not a easy choice as I realized that once on the drug Gabapentin I would most likely use it for many years as it is not so easy to get off of it and would need tapering. This drug has been amazing and I have not felt this good in years. I will continue to use it and may increase the dose from 600 mg a day to 900 mg a day. It has been alive saver. I highly recommend this drug for anxiety,10,30
Gabapentin,"Seriously the best for anxiety. I've been through countless SSRI's, buspar, Ativan, xanax, etc and gabapentin has worked better than all those combined for my anxiety and panic attacks.",10,32
Gabapentin,"After going through some major crisis in my life, my Provider and I tried a few antidepressants to help me cope with severe anxiety.   Zoloft, prozac, effexor, etc.  We also tried some Benzos, but nothing seemed to work until I stumbled upon Gabapentin  (Neurontin).  A low dose seemed to work for me....around 300mg / day.  It changed my life.",10,42
Gabapentin,"I have been using Gabapentin (300 mg twice daily) for about a month now, and I am very happy with it. I had been plagued by anxiety for most of my life (I'm 47 now), and my anxiety reached intolerable levels in the last year or so due to a very demanding new job. I finally decided I needed some sort of medication, and after trying Wellbutrin (thumbs down), I asked for Gabapentin. This med is doing exactly what I needed it to do: it is reducing my fears, uncontrollable worries, and hair-trigger adrenaline response to almost zero. Those bad feelings are down to like 2 out of 10, and before it was usually like 8 or 9.  Wish I'd started taking it a long time ago!",10,65
Gabapentin,"I was prescribed gabapentin for anxiety about a month ago. The first day I felt better than I have in a long time, but every day since then has been more hellish than the last. It is a clear day 1 was a fluke. Not only is the drug not working for me, it seems to actually be making me worse. (My husband noticed this as well, it's not in my head.)",1,19
Gabapentin,"When I first tried it I thought it helped my anxiety. Could have been a Placebo effect. After three or four days I wasn't sure it worked for me. When it did work, I felt really strange on it. Not a good feeling. I've tried it several more times and again I wasn't sure if it worked or not as I usually become more relaxed in the evening. I'm glad to see it works for many as it's better to use this then a Benzo that can really mess you up.",5,15
Gabapentin,"I first started to take Gabapentin as an off-label treatment for severe anxiety and OCD. While it did calm my intrusive thoughts a little, it in turn made me experience insomnia. I tried supplements and natural sleep aids to try to help me get to sleep at night but to no avail. Due to lack of sleep and perhaps the Gabapentin I began to feel depressed so I got off of it. It may work for others but for me it wasn't very effective for anxiety or OCD.",4,17
Gabapentin,"I agree Gabapentin is the only thing that  has help with my anxiety, I tried others medications but it don't work. I'm just taking it as needed for my anxiety and help me sleep. You can't just stop it like that. You have to weaned yourself off it. My anxiety got worse when I lost my mother in 2014. I wish everyone the best. You do what works for you. Everybody is different.",0,36
Gabapentin,"I've suffered from bouts of severe anxiety since I was 5 years old. I'm 44 now. The Dr put me on Xanax, but that never seemed to do much for me except finally let me sleep for a few hours if I took more than my prescribed dosage. I also have degenerative disc disease in my lower back &amp; was put on Gaba for nerve pain about a year ago. I couldn't believe the effect it had on the anxiety. It's like it snips some internal wire a)&amp; cuts the anxiety off. It's been a life saver for me, literally. HOWEVER, I say this with a warning. Obviously, not everyone gets this effect from Gaba. And, when I tried stopping cold turkey once, the anxiety came back worse than ever - like super bad.  So, it's a long term commitment, be aware.",9,44
Gabapentin,"I have been taking Ativan for 2 years first 0.5mgs. 3x/day for a year, then .5mgs. 2x/day for a year and now .5mgs. 1/day since January 2017. I have anxiety and panic attacks due to health issues. To help me withdraw from Ativan I was prescribed 100mg. of Gabapentin 2x/day. I was noticing no change in my anxiety. My Dr insisted 100mg. was a very low dose and I needed to experiment with taking more. Due to migraines and the use of Imitrex I can't take anti-depressants, else you might get  seratonin syndrome.  Ativan is a nightmare drug to get off of ... don't start! Today I took 200mgs. of Gabapentin and haven't taken any Ativan ... I actually felt better ... I have thoroughly enjoyed all the positive posts. My goal is to get off all meds ...",0,24
Gabapentin,"I've tried other drugs to treat my anxiety and depression with no luck. With gabapentin I'm able to function more normally. Gabapentin works for me where other drugs did not. For me it also improves my ability to multitask. I can concentrate and zone in on the task at hand. A welcome side effect is that smoking while the gabapentin is active makes me sick... I'm trying to use that as a way to quit. Also I occasionally lose balance and get the munchies, similar to cannabis. Please hear me... if you need help and have tried other drugs without help, try gabapentin. I still suffer but it provides me with the ability to function. It may also work for you.",9,48
Gabapentin,"I was just prescribed Gabapentin for anxiety coming off of alcohol. I'm taking Antabuse also, so since booze isn't an option and the doc won't prescribe a bento, I had to try his recommendation. I'm prescribed 2 x 300mg a day. Day 1, an hour after I took my first, felt like I was on a low dose of adderall more than a relaxer. Slight tremble in my hands, very talkative. Day 2, I took the morning dose and a cup of coffee. 2 hours later, I started getting shocks (not brain zaps), but shocks like I felt I might have a seizure. Told the doc, said impossible it's related. Took my evening dose. An hour later, super irritable, trouble walking, very dizzy. Stopped the Med.",5,19
Gabapentin,"I have pretty severe social anxiety, always have. I have tried a lot of SSRI as well as other drugs over the years. Gabapentin is the only drug that makes me feel at ease. I also take small amounts of Xanax before situations that make me especially nervous. I find that Gabapentin changes my personality somewhat though. I get angry, have paranoid thoughts and tend to believe unrealistic things, and generally care about everything less (which is good and bad). It can be difficult to maintain motivation and concentration to get necessary tasks completed. I have a job in which I have to interact with people a lot and even hold meetings. The positive effects of the gabapentin really make the negative effects tolerable.",9,24
Gabapentin,"I started Gabapentin 7 days ago taking 200mg twice per day. My GAD is worst in the morning and slowly subsides as the day goes on. I also stopped Valium 7 days ago. After many years of using benzos I decided it was enough as I'm sure it was just making my anxiety worse and certainly wasn't helping. Gabapentin has helped me and I feel a lot better than when I was on Valium. I don't know if I'm getting Valium withdrawal effects since it's only been 1 week or side effects from Gabapentin. Feel some nausea, light headed and my breathing is heavy. Overall better and can manage.",8,19
Gabapentin,"When I read all the glowing reviews for this med, my hopes skyrocketed...I thought, finally, I've found the promised land relative to treating my anxiety.  After being on the medication for a week now, I confidently say that I have had zero benefit from gabapentin. Maybe others had less acute anxiety, but for me, this drug did nothing.  Wanted to share this with those thinking of switching to this med, as my advise is to keep your expectations low so you don't get disappointed.",1,27
Gabapentin,I've been using gabapentin for anxiety along with lamictal for bipolar type 2. Before the gabapentin I was on vistaril. I didn't like the way vistaril made me feel during my attacks and gabapentin has made it so much easier to manage throughout the day and even the attacks aren't as bad. I also have PTSD and it's made it a lot easier to function. I take one 100mg capsule three times a day.,8,31
Gabapentin,"I have had GAD ever since I can remember and I am 31 now. NOTHING and I mean NOTHING helped. My anxiety was so extreme, every minute of every day I was consumed with it. I had severe panic attacks and would sometimes faint. Gabapentin has been life changing for me. I have been on it for 3 months and my GAD is almost gone. I still have panic attacks at night, but this medication has been a miracle for me and I am and would definitely recommend trying it, specially if you are not responsive to 'normal' anxiety medications.",10,57
Gabapentin,After going through hell using anti depressants I finally went to a specialist for anxiety. She did a DNA test to see what drugs would best work for me. I take one Clonazepam along with a Gabapentin in the am and then a second Gabapentin in the afternoon. It truly has been a life saver for me when nothing else worked for PSTD/anxiety. No side effects whatsoever. Be very careful with alcohol. Instead of three beers make it one.,10,45
Gabapentin,Very good for anxiety. reflects many modes of anxiety BUT... this drug  may give you panic attack and restless leg syndrome (Which is weird as this drug is used to treat restless leg syndrome),7,21
Gabapentin,"I took 1200 mg of gabapentin for a year for anxiety after stopping  citalopram and diazepam. It had no effect at all. I felt the same before I started it, when I was on it, and after I had stopped it. It didn't even have side effects. It did nothing. I have been on numerous SSRI'S, Seroquel, lithium, Lamictal and benzos for bipolar 2 with episodes of depressive/anxiety. Thankfully, the government disability insurance paid for gabapentin and not me.",1,10
Gabapentin,"I take 300 mg 3x a day and I feel the best I've felt in 10 years. Nothing has worked to calm my anxiety like Gabapentin including Klonopin or Xanax. I'm happy, relaxed, motivated and most importantly my appetite for alcohol which I used excessively to calm my anxiety has completely disappeared. I hope I can take this medication for forever. Life is finally good again.",10,111
Gabapentin,"I had pretty bad anxiety. My Doctor said to take 300mg of Gabapentin three times a day. The first time I took it was at night, before bed. It made me a little drunk feeling or maybe dopey. But, not a bad feeling. Not dizzy, not falling down - no other side effects. Made me a little sleepy to help with my insomnia. Next day - took 300mg at 9:00 a.m. - no problems, no side effects, nothing. Just anxiety relief. Once in a while I can feel the anxiety after about 6 hours when I need to take another pill. Started taking 600mg at bed time to help with sleep. The first time I raised the dose, it made me a little more tired and a little tipsy feeling. But only once. For anxiety, this stuff worked great for me with no side effects!!!",9,56
Gabapentin,I started talking 600 mg three times a day for anxiety. It has done wonders. I used to have really bad anxiety when driving. I no longer have it. I also have really bad social anxiety. Now.... I sometimes can't stop talking to everyone.  lol The only downside is I feel a little weak and sleepy sometimes. Which makes it hard having a toddler.,8,41
Gabapentin,"I have been suffering from the anxiety for the past four years. I  have been on Ativan, Xanax, and many SSRI drugs. Nothing helped. As a matter fact, the SSRI drugs made my anxiety worse. Finally a psychiatrist prescribed gabapentin. It has been a miracle for me. I don't have any side effects whatsoever. All of the physical symptoms of anxiety (heart palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, tiredness) have disappeared. I I also feel more even. I have more patience and I'm not in such a rush to do things. I take three 300 mg pills a day. I am so thankful for finding this drug. I know how hard it is to try different medications and have them not work.  I hope anybody who is suffering from anxiety finally finds a medication that helps.",10,55
Gabapentin,"After a 4 day hospitalization for anxiety and to reduce prescription drug usage I was disturbed by the zombifying drugs I was prescribed (Trazodone, Abilify, Lithium).  I'd been having a very hard time leaving my house and answering the phone.  I was eventually prescribed Gabapentin while I continued to titrate off of Xanax.  While I've started craving sweets and drinking sodas ( I ate an entire cake in 24 hours) I am feeling much better.  It does not, however, help me sleep.  I try to take my last dose before 6pm.  I experimented last night and took it right before bed and I woke up every couple of hours.  I have unusual reactions to meds and  adjust my expectations and understanding of side effects. This is a helpful drug for anxiety.",7,31
Gabapentin,"I've had Anxiety since I was a little child 6 yrs old to be exact. So over the years ( I'm 56 now) I've also developed PTSD, OCD Depression And recently agoraphobia..under a former Drs Orders because I'm such a severe case I was prescribed 4mg of xanax and 4mg of Klonopin along with 10/325 hydrocodone 5 times a day for severe neck and back pain from bulging discs causing spinal stenosis all throughout from my neck all the way down to my lumbar spine. Already had spinal fusion at L5S1. I ended up overdosing when he added Percocet. I found a new Dr.and he weaned me safely off of everything and now I'm taking 2400 mg of Gabapentin  it has been a miracle. Best med by far for my Anxiety. Sill need neck surgery but my Anxiety has left the bldg.",9,38
Gabapentin,This medication made me really down . It was completely ineffective for my neuropathy. I would highly recommend that no one take this medication.,1,8
Gabapentin,"This medication was working for my anxiety but never really made it go away. My psychiatrist kept insisting raising dosage since was only taking 200mg at night &amp; 200mg in morning. So I started taking 300mg at night for a week and woke up completely disoriented with the whole room moving, vomiting, falling down. I couldn't even sit anymore or lift head without falling backwards and would throw up in the car (someone had to drive me to doc) All these symptoms are so horrible with anxiety. I lowered dose back to 200mg that day 2 times a day. It's been 5 days and still have symptoms. Be careful with this med. I never had symptoms before the increase.",5,18
Gabapentin,"So I started taking gaba 2 years ago for anxiety but yet I became more and more of an alcoholic. I did not even know that this medication was for that. Now I went to the doctor and am on other meds and gaba is making me a to talk backwards, forget with in minutes and disoriented . I sleep ill noon and then run into things. My doctor didn't think he should mention this but the pharmacist did. I have a child. Please do your research.",2,14
Gabapentin,"I have been on gabapentin and prozac for 18 months now and seem to be tolerating it well. I was taking a Effexor before, and having problems. Coming off of Effexor shot my GAD through the roof and I ended up in hospital. Bad scene. They don't prescribe benzodiazepines for long term use anymore, but gabapentin seems to be working, and with less side effects.",10,27
Gabapentin,"I've been on this medication for about two weeks, I take  150mg twice a day so 300mg a day. At first I slept a lot! but it really does help with my generalized anxiety.",9,30
Gabapentin,"I've been suffering from Anxiety, nervousness and depression for the last 6 years. I've taken 150mg Zoloft for 8 weeks and while my depression is OK, my anxiety is still there. I take 125mg Trazadone to help me sleep. I'm tapering down my diazepam (valium) which first helped but  than made me worse. I just started Gabapentin 3 days ago.The first day I took 100mg and it really relaxed me, even better than any benzo can now. Side effects are blurred vision, dizziness and weakness. Hope these will go away in the next two weeks.",10,17
Gabapentin,"I started off on 100mg for anxiety for 6 months now my doctor bumped it up to 600mg a day.... It doesn't work for my aniexty It works good for my nerve pain in hands, legs, arms.... It's not a good Medicine for anxiety",2,7
Gabapentin,"Day 1 , I am 27 type 1 diabetic diagnosed 2 years ago I live on my own I feel let down a lot with how the NHS prolongs people's misery unknowingly of course. I'm not saying they are bad , they are angels, a lot of them have saved my life a few times I owe a lot to them . I have had the most excruciating pain in chest, body, back, arms, legs, toes, fingers, head you name it. I have had pain in all forms like stabbing burning aching pounding for months on end, not thinking clea,r having endless plans of how I'm going to turn everything around, but I would never be able to due to pain anxiety attacks and nerve pain. I felt hopeless until today I got the point across to my doctor and he gave me gabapentin omg I've rebooted I'm non stop moving and achieving. Yay",0,25
Gabapentin,Just started taking gabapentin.  Nervous about taking it .  Have been taking it for one week.  Currently taking 100 mg 2 x daily. Not sure if it is working.  Reassured by positive feedback on this site but part of my problem is fear about taking pills.   How long before you start to feel comfortable with this med?,6,22
Gabapentin,"For the last 7 years I have had severe anxiety, panic attacks, and insomnia. I was given remeron for sleep and klonopin for anxiety. Recently my pdoc and I decided it's time for me to get off the benzos. She gave me gabapentin and it's been a life saver. I'm doing well at gradually tapering off klonopin. The only drawback I find is that gabapentin wears off rather fast, and your body builds up a tolerance really fast. Been on it for 3 months now. I started at 100mg 3 times a day. Within a month I was up to 300mg 3xdaily and 600mg at night. Currently I am only taking it PRN at 300mg. As someone who has tried every mood stabilizer and anxiety medication  under the sun. Gabapentin is amazing!",8,51
Gabapentin,"When I first took this drug it was amazing almost seemed as though I were tapping into the right side of my pain crazy right. I Love Love Love it, but seems like it started  wearing off so took larger dose worked but again wore off. Don't know what the answer is. But It was an awesome drug bless the day they started it to us anxiety people.........",0,21
Gabapentin,They help with my stress. And calm down my restless legs a lot. Make me a little drowsy.,0,20
Gabapentin,This medication has worked wonders for me..it changed my life I was a the verge of suicide. It brought me out of my shell and now I'm going back to school and doing well..thanks to this medication.,10,68
Gabapentin,"My doctor put me on this to help with my anxiety symptoms which include tight and sore jaw, tight and sore shoulders and tight and sore stomach. Not only did it take all that away, it helps me to sleep. I used to sleep great and didn't have these anxiety symptoms before my gastric sleeve surgery but ever since, I am developed insomnia and these anxiety symptoms. This has been a life saver for me!",9,43
Gabapentin,"I'm diagnosed MDD &amp; Bipolar, Type 2, and this is the first medication I've taken that has a significant positive impact on my anxiety without bad side effects. I usually worry, have circular negative thought patterns, and feel awkward and lost in my head most of the day. But I've gone from 300mg to 400mg and now to 600 mg of generic gabapentin, and it works wonderfully. It doesn't make me sleepy, unlike benzos. Like quite a few people, I've abused benzos in the past, but rarely get an urge to take too many gabapentin because of the limited recreational use. In conclusion: in my opinion, gabapentin is a wonder-drug for anxiety; especially for addicts and/or those with bipolar disorder.",10,49
Gabapentin,"In 2009 I was nearly crippled by severe general anxiety disorder and have taken xanax every single day of my life since. In the past year, through the use of regular yoga and meditation, I have weaned back to 1mg/day. However, I could never really sleep deeply and I could not go a night without xanax. I would basically get no sleep at all. Even with it, I would often wake up at 4am and need to take more. Two months ago I was prescribed duloxetine. I take it at bedtime and it helps, but it never really shut off that buzzing anxiety in the background of my brain. So doc started me on gabapentin and I have been sleeping like a baby and slowly reducing the xanax. It's even helped some with my fibromyalgia.",10,41
Gabapentin,Gabapentin saved me from anxiety and I inadvertently weaned off of klonopin while on it. I love it. Improved my quality of life significantly!,10,59
Gabapentin,Gabepen has turned me inton a ZOMBIE. I have kidney disease and never should had  been prescribed this medication.,1,13
Gabapentin,"In a chemical dependancy program, suffered from anxiety and insomnia. Gabapentin saved my life. 300mg, 3X a day. 50mg of seroquel at night for sleep. I finally feel normal for the first time since my early 20's. I am 42.  Best sleep ever, deep sleep, full dreams. Gabapentin made me feel a bit foggy for the first 2 weeks, but after settling in, I function fine, with normal energy and normal reactions to life. It has stabilized my appetite as well, I have actually lost 20 pounds in the past 6 weeks.",10,58
Gabapentin,It seems to work for generalized anxiety when taken in large doses twice a day (for me anyway). It does seem to cause weight gain though.,8,25
Gabapentin,I think Gabapentin works better than benzodiazepines. I do not like taking benzos because they make me sleep. Gabapentin does relax me believe it or not I don't know about you but it does work for me. Of course for some reason I have to take more than 300 mg for it to relax me but it does work. And it doesn't make me sleepy but it does make me hungry LOL. I prefer Gabapentin or Neurontin over benzodiazepines.,10,46
Gabapentin,I WAS GIVEN GABAPENTIN FOR ANXIETY ABOUT  SIX MONTHS AGO AND BEGAN TO HAVE SIDE EFFECTS  VERY SOON. HIGHEST DOSE WAS 300MG THREE TIMES PER DAY.  WAS TAKEN TO HOSPITAL SIX WEEKS AGO WITH SYMPTOMS OF A HEART ATTACK. AN ANGIOGRAM WAS DONE AND RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE BUT THE CHEST AND ARM PAINS EVEN FOOLED THE CARDIO PEOPLE. HEART DOCTOR TOLD ME TO STOP GABEPENTIN IMMED. I have been tapering for five weeks and it has been awful. PLEASE DON'T USE THIS DRUG,1,21
Gabapentin,"I had a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in 2006, since then we have tried multiple medications to control Anger.  Depakote,  Topamax, Klonapin, Zoloft etc etc.   None of them worked .  I have been in rages to where I don't want to be around anyone or talk. It's been 10 years now and I happened to go to a doctor in a small town and told her everything about my anger etc . She prescribed Gabapentin along with Cymbalta and I have felt the greatest change. I go outdoors and hike, fish , feel like I am living again. Still I will have my bad days but this medicine I highly recommend to people who suffer with anger/irritability.   I completely understand that we are all different and medicines work differently and I truly hope the best for you reading this.",10,79
Gabapentin,Quick relieve from anxiety improved mood and more productivity. Love it.,9,62
Gabapentin,So far works better than anything else I've tried for social anxiety,10,59
Gabapentin,"I have been through many mental health diagnosis and double the amount in meds. I have been officially diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, severe generalized anxiety, situational panic attacks, delayed onset PTSD and a sensory processing disorder. I have tried many many drugs over the years to help with absolutely no luck. Until my therapist recommended gabapentin. Oh my goodness thank that wonderful man. I feel incredible. Absolutely no anxiety. I sleep wonderful at night and have energy during the day. I can tackle most obstacles with out crippling fear and panic. This drug literally saved my life. No real side effects for me which is extra amazing!",10,111
Gabapentin,"I am an alcoholic with severe anxiety and depression.  I am prescribed the max dose (1,200 mgs) 3x a day.  I find some relief, but not the same relief I am looking for when I take benzos like Klonopin.  I really only notice the effects of Gabapentin when I am not taking it, because I am a nervous wreck.  During the experience I might just be numbed to knowing how I feel, and I think this is the point of the medication.",7,39
Gabapentin,I'm pretty sure I've been taking it for over a year and it's amazing how much it has helped me handle my anxiety! I used to have suicidal thoughts and panic attacks daily but now I never have suicidal thoughts and I only have panic attacks once in a blue moon during my period. I'm sure my anti depression meds and my birth control are definitely helping but I know that without Gabapentin my anxiety would be a wreck still. Super glad my psychiatrist placed me on it!,10,56
Gabapentin,"Gabapentin has really helped me with anxiety. I used to always be thinking of what I had to do while I was busy with something else.  For example, I would worry about what I had to do after work while I was at work.  I would play future scenarios over and over before they even occurred. I would play past experiences over and over.  Some call this rumination.  Much of this has either dropped down to a manageable level or just disappeared with gabapentin. I have never been one much into pharmaceuticals but this one works for me.  I can see that some people love how it works for them, some people despise of it, and others say it doesn't do a thing for them. We are all different and what works for one doesn't work for another, just like diet. I'm much happier going out and doing ordinary things like shopping, going to the bank, and other ordinary routine tasks.  I easily get bored with ordinary tasks and just want to get them done.  I just wanted to get things over with so that I could take on the next task. Now, I can be more with what I am doing without having to rush through it to get to the next goal. I take my time and stop to talk with people.  It's ok if I'm late for the next task so long as it's not an appointment where others are involved.  The main thing for me is to enjoy people when I go out to a store, or the bank, or wherever!  The gabapentin helps a part of my brain slow down so that I can see the people in my day.   It really feels good to go to the gym and not feel tied to a specific exercise routine anymore. I like going in with a goal in mind, but allow for what the body is telling me.  Instead of just checking in at the desk, I'm more likely to spend time saying hello and having patience. So what if it means that I will get home 5 minutes later and eat dinner 5 minutes later, and then get 5 minutes less sleep. Big deal!  I see from writing this that gabapentin helps me to be less obsessive With gabapentin, it is much easier for me to accept doing a job I am tired of. I've been at the same job for a long job and was getting antsy to move on. There isn't anything bad about the job, but doing anything forever gets kind of old. Now, I know that soon I will be making a change, but can bemore patient until the change happens. If I were completely patient, then the change would never happen. There is still fire to make the change happen. I feel less anxiety about change and welcome it more now. There are times in life when change is good.  I don't feel as dead in my tracks with fearing change. It's  o.k. if I don't figure out everything today because there is always tomorrow!  Yes, I am very satisfied with how gabapentin works.  I give it a 10 out of 10.",10,147
Gabapentin,I have been battling severe anxiety and PTSD since I was a child. I am 43 years old. I have tried a vast majority of medications only to find out I don't react well  to the majority.  I have recently been hospitalized twice in the last two years due to an allergic reaction to benzodiaphines klonipin and Ativan.  Instead of decreasing my anxiety it increased it to the point I was having suicidal idealisations.  I also ensured extreme memory loss while on the benzodiazapines. My Dr. prescribed me neurotin and I was transformed a metamorphosis occurred I shed the anxiety and the depression and negative thoughts of doom. I have my life back!!  I can live with side effects I love being able to leave my house !!,10,75
Gabapentin,"I've had bad anxiety since I was a teen (now 38). I was usually prescribed a benzo, their effective yet very addictive. Anyway, I take 800mg of gabapentin 3x daily with Prozac and they work very well together and I'm finally getting used to not having to take benzos anymore. And my sciatica pain is greatly reduced.  God bless.",8,58
Gabapentin,So for it help with my anxiety. But with pain I wonder do it help with that.,10,8
Gabapentin,"I am truly amazed by how well this works for my anxiety. I have PTSD, nightmares and waking up from them would ruin my day I would have flashbacks but ever since I started this new medication  I feel normal which is something I am not used to it is definitely exciting to know that I don't feel anxious to the point of feeling like I can't breathe I feel normal and that is amazing.. I don't even feel that I need my Xanax.  Which is a huge  relief and I am so happy that I finally found a medication that can help with my High anxiety  and PTSD without having to take so many benzo's",9,65
Gabapentin,"For years I could not pinpoint what was causing such cripling anxiety, insomnia and issues with focus and low grade mood issues.  Then after doing some family geneaology, I realized I had inherited traits from a side of the family with the Bipolar Disorder.  I quickly started taking Neurontin and within the span of literally 1 (one) day the issues started to resolve almost immediately.  I can now drive, go out in public, interact with more people, get a great sleep and I have less racing thoughts than ever before.  It has also helped manage and eliminate some nerve pain from a damaged nerve due to lung surgery in 2005. I also take Lamictal for my low grade moods.  I have what is known as Cyclothymia, a unique form of the Bipolar disorder.",10,52
Gabapentin,"On Neurontin (300 mg 3x a day) for nerve pain.  It's fascinating to read polar opposite experiences with this drug - depression/anxiety reduction, seizures/anti-seizure, pain/pain reduction etc. Apparently, too tight this will loosen you, too loose this will unravel you. I guess I was too tight, this has been marvellous for reducing pain as well as anxiety.  My only discomfort is that if I don't take it I go into a tailspin within a day or two, very (very) irritable, hyper-anxious and insomniac.  I also find that increasing the dosage is, well, a little TOO pleasant, it makes it tempting to abuse it.  Oh, one thing, I can see why this is called GABApentin, if I take all 900 mg before bedtime I wake up chattering like a monkey.  :)",8,79
Gabapentin,They are amazing took the anxiety away. A little time to get use to them but they really work.,10,60
Gabapentin,"I use gabapentin to treat my anxiety, tried every other medication, at least 30 over the years I take a very small amount each day one capsule which I open will last 2 weeks, very few side effects great medication.",8,39
Gabapentin,"Suffered from extreme anxiety and depression for years. Now taking 900mg of gabapentin daily and anxiety has disappeared. Side effects dizziness, unpleasant tasting food but worth it as anxiety is gone.",10,56
Gabapentin,"Love it!  Gabapentin seriously altered my life in a good way.  Reached out to old friends, no longer get blitz drunk at social events.  Answer my phone.  Started a business.  I am  networking with peers even!  Just a great little helper in life.  I highly recommend this (under physician direction) if you want something that has little side effects.  Keep in mind you have to alter dose to keep it effective i.e. - lower the intake a few days per week.   Also, watch out on going completely off after using a while - definitely taper and use CBT as you'll kinda notice some negative thoughts.

Gabapentin,"I was taken off of Alprazolam, cold turkey, and given Gabapentin to help with possible withdrawal.  This was a NIGHTMARE!!! I had taken Gabapentin for a short period of time before, for Carpel Tunnel, but it gave me what I call drunk body syndrome, and I would be off balance, bump into things, etc.  I didn't really have negative effects while taking Gabapentin this time around UNTIL I stopped taking it. No one told me to very veryyyyy gradually ween myself off. I almost immediately went back &amp; forth between having the most severe hot flashes one could even imagine (I mean, I was sweating bullets like a mad woman), cold chills, terrible body aches, flushed face, severe anxiety. It felt like the flu. Called my Dr and went back on Alprazolam.",1,29
Gabapentin,Stay away from off label meds.. had anxiety  now suffer random muscle twitching tingling and insomnia. The nightmares when you do sleep definitely dont help the anxiety!,1,18
Gabapentin,"I went on this when starting an alcohol cessation program and have been on it for a couple of years. I take 1600 mg a day. I sleep better and have less anxiety because of it, and it does not have any negative side effects for me.  My doctor has wanted to take me off it because she says it's not supposed to be prescribed for anxiety but I find that when I stop taking it or forget to take it, I have problems dealing with anxiety issues and generally find myself more relaxed and able to cope with the stresses of life.",8,42
Gabapentin,"I am not sure yet if it working, but from a scale of 1 to 10, I would have to say 8. I have back pain, stress, and anxiety. If this is a cure all for all with out having to resort to Vicodin, bring it on.",7,43
Gabapentin,"I take 900mg every night night for social and generalized anxiety and 100mg several times per day as needed for breakthrough panic attacks--which isn't very often. I had been prescribed several different SSRIs before for my social anxiety, none of which worked, but Gabapentin was like a miracle for me. It was almost as if someone flipped a switch in my head when I started taking it.",10,90
Gabapentin,"It has been a godsend anxiety treatment for me, relieving me of what was once crippling anxiety.",10,81
Gabapentin,I had a very severe pain from my upper back to my neck.The pain was extremely severe.My Doctor prescribed Gabapantin  It works like a champ.,10,52
Gabapentin,"I was on vistaril, which worked for a while, but stopped working because with my OCD, I am terrified of taking med's that come in capsules.  My doctor finally put me on Gabapentin, and it works like a charm.  The only side effect of note has been dry mouth, which is easily taken care of.  I love this med.",10,61
Gabapentin,"I am taking this medicine for severe anxiety and worry. I've tried many other medicines with little benefit and my doctor said that gabapentin works well in patients where the traditional SSRI's don't work. She was right. Within THREE DAYS I found significant relief from my symptoms. The only downside is INSOMNIA. Not sure this is even a common side effect but I haven't slept in like five days. Hoping I don't have to get off of the medicine because it is really helping me, but man am I tired.",7,56
Gabapentin,It is the only anxiety medication I have found with any legitimate effect for me.,10,59
Gabapentin,"AS like so many others have posted, I too have had major depression,bi-polar disorder,and anxiety. I've been on every med imaginable for these diagnoses and they all have stopped working. My current regimen is Cymbalta 90mg bid and Zyprexa 5mg @bedtime. I now have been taking gabapentin 400mg tid. (I'm also a recovering opiate addict.) anyways, the gabapentin seems to give me a pleasant type of calmness. I am saying tons of prayers that this is the missing piece for me. I'll try ANYTHING to get my life back. ANYTHING",8,82
Gabapentin,I was prescribed this for nerve pain in neck and back. It has helped with the pain but the unexpected mood enhancement side affect has been very welcome. I didn't realise how much of my time was taken up with negative thoughts and mild depression. I am much more focused and positive. It's like aspects of my personality that had been wittled away by the rigours of daily life have returned. I am also a  performer and have found it very calming. After experimenting with dosages and working out the trade off between pain relif and drowsiness I found a level.  My only side affect which I haven't noticed anyone mentioning in the reviews is that I pee more often. But I'm so laid back these days that it doesn't matter lol.,10,115
Gabapentin,I found a huge difference just from day 1. I have noticed a huge difference in my depression. I had gained a lot of weight though I don't know if that's from getting clean or not. It really does help though.,0,42
Gabapentin,"I was prescribed this for Anxiety never should have had such strong medication for that as it controls seizures and brain injurys. My physical health&amp; nerves were fine before this. Nuerontin destroyed the nerves in my hands&amp; feet&amp; gave me Peripheral&amp; Axonal Neuropathy. Ironically its used to treat these nerve conditions but because my nerves were fine before taking it,It did the opposite and destroyed the nerves in my hands&amp; feet destroying my life. Have been disabled 8 yrs for trusting my Dr and the damage is irreversable. Drs shouldn't use patientz as guinea pigs and pharmaceutical companies should not  e allowed to give medication not intended for medical conditions.I have lost 8 yrs of my life due to this medication and am not diabetic.",1,43
Gabapentin,"I have been taking Gabapentin for about 8 months and I don't feel any benefit from it.  My doctor increased my dosage about 2 months ago and still I find no help in this drug for me.  I am not saying that this drug doesn't work for others, but for me it is a waste.  My friend takes this drug and it works great for her.  I must be medication resistant.  What bothers me is that my doctor continues to tell me to stay on it and I want to gradually wean off it.  My doctor doesn't hear me.  So I will find another doctor who will.  As far as a pain reliever, this drug does not even cover my restless leg syndrome.  Strange.",1,39
Gabapentin,"I am Rxed this 6/day for neuropathy but on the side for anxiety too. In my opinion, if you have panic attacks, just stick to a benzodiazepine as if you're not taking long term, it's not bad. If you find Gabapentin to work, then take that but usually Gabapentin is given as a regimen for generalized anxiety. I've never had luck with Gabapentin but I would prefer someone take that for chronic anxiety than a benzo. However, don't let the med fool you... It can be a nightmare to get off of this med. Sometimes just as hard as benzo's. If you take this daily to prevent panic attacks but don't have panic attacks daily, I advise against this med. It's easy to build a tolerance too and constantly have to raise the dose. Not too effective.",3,38
Gabapentin,"Like many of you, I have tried several SNRI's and SSRI's..None work after a certain time period, and nearly all cause weight gain. I am thrilled that I might have actually found a solution to my chronic depression especially given this med is meant more for Bi-polar which is not my diagnosis. I have energy for the first time in years, no weight gain, no increase in appetite! Sleeping great and waking up with energy. I'm almost afraid to write this because I may jinx it but I feel great.. I am only on 200 mg. split up twice a day and I don't need to increase at this point so I'm sticking with this low dose. very happy so far. I hope this review helps other who have struggled with finding a solutions to chronic depression..",8,114
Gabapentin,"I was on low dose Xanax for 12 years. When coming off it, I had terrible withdrawals and my old Dr wouldn't do anything for me so I was drinking 2-3 times a week and craving it the other 4-5 days.  Got a new Dr and he gave me Baclofen and Gabapentin and other than blurred vision and a general dizziness, they have taken away the withdrawals and I have no Anxiety or RLS. I no longer drink and have determined that doing so makes the RLS worse. I no longer crave alcohol. I was able to cold turkey stop the Xanax. I presume the Gabapentin is for RLS and anxiety. I take 400mg 3-4 times a day. (220 pound male) Have been on them about 5 months now. I forget the exact cost, I'm guessing about $18 for 3 months worth. (generic)",0,69
Gabapentin,"Started Gaba on 8-7-16. I take 900 mg daily (split my dosage.) Remember, Gaba is an off label used for Anxiety &amp; you can't blame it if it doesn't work for anxiety (I find negative reviews for gaba unfair on this site.) I take Prozac 40 mg; but I still have light anxiety, panicky feeling, nausea &amp; mental agitation. I have to use 4 or 5 mg Valium prn to smooth out Prozac can't fix at times. I suggested trying Gaba w/ my psyche; he agreed. 300 mg first wk, 2nd wk 600, &amp; 3rd wk 900. Gaba added has been effective for anxiety. I feel less anxious &amp; mental agitation reduced.At first, Gaba will make you drowsy &amp; weak. My memory is slightly off but if I really focus I am fine.You might feel shaky at the start. Some bad days, be vigorous. Be positive",10,90
Gabapentin,"I am on meds for depression and they're working. Thank God. Anxiety is an issue,  so my psychiatrist prescribed gabapentin,  300mg. The suggested dosage is one, 4x per day. I don't do that but instead take it when I'm feeling anxious and it works like a charm. Plus it helps me fall and stay asleep. Am hungrier but I can control that. Great medication.",10,83
Gabapentin,"Battled a paralyzing anxiety for years.  A friend let me try some of his gabapentin and I never went back!   Yes there are some weird side effects but u get used to them. I am a trail runner and motorcycle rider and it never impaired me either way. My take on it is simple - if u need gabapentin for anxiety it is incredible. If gabapentin doesn't help your anxiety - it might not be anxiety you havever, I'm no doctor.  Just my opinion.",10,75
Gabapentin,"My anxiety &amp; depression were well controlled on cymbalta. I was put on Gabapentin for neuropathy, at first it helped with pain in one spot, then as my dose was increased I began to experience side effects.  1) Even with taking it at 5 or 6 pm with food I would sleep for 14-17 hours 2)I could not remember things, I could not think straight. My intellect was impaired. I never could build up a tolerance for taking it in the day time. 3) I became depressed &amp; anxious---I feel like I lost weeks of my life I will never get back. 4) I had a creepy crawly sensation in my feet that felt like I was walking on sandpaper.  I have been an RN for 42 years. I do not do recreational drugs, smoke or abuse narcotics. I drink alcohal once or twice a ye",1,39
Gabapentin,"I am not a fan of this med. I started taking it for anxiety and it caused vision changes and major sedation for me even at a low dose. I stayed on it for a few years because did help some with anxiety. I just recently decided to come off of it and to my surprise there are withdrawals. My whole body aches, and I feel sick and have no appetite. I took my last dose a week ago and the withdrawals are still very noticeable. I know some people that have said Neurontin helped them a lot but for me it offered slight anxiety relief, sedated me, caused blurred vision and made me mentally slower.",2,41
Gabapentin,I'm so sad reading all these great reviews . I am the odd one out I first time I took gabapentin it was prescribed 300mg 3x daily prn for anxiety and I took one and it helped alottle but not much so I waited about 30 minutes and took another I was on cloud 9 nothing bothered me and I slept like a baby . But my dr told me to take 2before bed and that was too much on my heart and I've never suffered heart problems on my life 600mg had my heart going so slow it hurt and I had to tell myself to breathe. Very scary and even days later I was still suffering complications. I'm too scared to go back to how I originally took it because anything that messes with my heart is a no for me,2,45
Gabapentin,"I am a very happy confidant nurse practitioner. This drug made me over a time period of less than a week suicidal. Extremely depressed, and uncontrollable crying for no reason. The procedure was elective and my suicidal  symptoms cleared up within 14 hours of discontinuation.",1,43
Gabapentin,"I've panic disorder. I've always been a treat as necessary type of patient  and I do prefer to only take meds as needed. Benzo's have always served me best, but my present pdoc is all about steering patients away from them. So, we started this med 3 mo ago. The only other meds I take regularly are propranolol for high bp, and seroquel on most nights.  1st week: gabapentin made me feel pleasantly high like a cannaboid might. I was talkative, appetite for food and drink increased, had a notable sense of well being. Since then, the effects (positive and negative) have dropped drastically. I may as well be taking dollar store kava kava for all I can tell.",4,40
Gabapentin,"I have horrible anxiety from my PTSD, not military related. I have been on nerontin for 2 months for my anxiety. It does not help me at all. Now I am just tired all the time. Which makes my anxiety worse. I have noticed my back pain is better.",1,30
Gabapentin,"Have been on this medication for about a month 200 mg 3x/day and have felt no effect at all positive or negative.  I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and this was supposed to help with mania, but I wonder if I have adhd instead and am being treated for the wrong thing.",2,13
Gabapentin,"I personally am a heavier person, i have a lot of anxiety and depression on a daily basis and its been this way since i was 14. Im now 18 and i've been using many different prescriptions for my anxiety and depression and i've found benzos work well. But recently I was prescribed gabapentin 300mg 4 times a day and I found that it does affect your coordination taking this much of a dose but amazingly took away all my anxiety without any xanax like I usually take and it worked even better for my depression. I do feel a buzz almost as many users report when they first start, which i don't mind as i work from home and enjoy it but this could be a problem for addiction. Luckily I'm only using it temporarily and not long term.",8,48
Gabapentin,"I have to say, it's been working very well for me. I'm more confident and I love being around people way more then before.  But, sometimes I feel very dizzy and I'm all over the place. I forget everything and I feel kinda lost. I feel like my brain is on slow motion.  The worst thing is I can't make love anymore. Its really hard to stimulate me and sometimes I can't even ejaculated. It brought me peace inside but I don't feel things anymore. Never happy, never too sad. I don't enjoy food. (Sorry for terrible english.)",7,63
Gabapentin,I've found this drug to be excellent for treating general anxiety and looping thoughts.  My anxiety is now buzzing in the background instead of punching me in the face.  I use neurontin in combination with Wellbutrin and lamictal. Great combo for a possibly bipolar recovering alcoholic :) The only slight downside is that it pushed my cravings for sugar and carbs through the roof.  I gained a little weight before I realized what was happening and then put myself in check.  Keep an eye out for that one.,9,107
Gabapentin,"After being on so many medications for a non clear mental disorder...perhaps bipolar or adhd.. or a mix of everthing  I was addicted to clonazepam, the worst medication I ever been and I was there for 10 years. Been also in all depresion medication.. But none worked. Been in straterra for adhd and was horrible.. didn't work. Was on Trileptal and it's a so heavy medication. I found in a high dosis perhaps 1200mg of gabapentin some real relief... Relief in anxiety and relief in some chronic pains after some surgery s. Between gabapentin some unisom I found relief..  I don't want to touch never again clonazepam or any benzodiazpein. Be careful with those medications, they destroy you. Sorry for my English... I'm trying to improve it every day",10,82
Gabapentin,"Went on a trial of gabapentin (300 mg 2x daily) about a month ago for anxiety to augment bupropion xl (150mg 1x daily) for anxiety and depression. Bupropion was working to clear up some clouds, but some underlying situational anxiety persisted. Adding gabapentin has been great! Only downside is mild blurred vision and a slight head-fuzz feeling the first couple of days, but that has dissipated. I'm considering asking my doctor for an increase in the gabapentin dose, but overall I feel much improved. I am pleased that these two medications are having a positive effect with minimal side-effects and that I don't have to go on an SSRI.",9,62
Gabapentin,Gabapentin has been very beneficial to me in many ways. I suffer from bipolar and anxiety disorders so most of the time I was all over the place. When I take neurontin it stabilizes my mood and all I do is feel good. I really can not say enough about this drug. I will say though that it affects individuals in different ways. I was just lucky enough for it to work for me.,0,85
Gabapentin,"This is a miracle drug as far as I'm concerned. I have struggled with depression, addiction and bipolar disorder most of my life. Until Gabapentin I was not living a full life most of the time. Since Gabapentin I have more confidence, energy and able to deal with stress so much better. I also sleep like a baby most of the time. I can't say enough good things about this drug.  It has given me hope and taken away that terrible feeling we all struggle with.",10,128
Gabapentin,Awful drug. I was on it for about a year straight and I could never comprehend anything. All though it did take away my anxiety it ruined my Brain. I couldn't retain information I always forgetting and misplacing things. Best thing I did was get off this drug. I swear it made dumb. I can't even remember words sometimes and when I was training at work on this medication I had such a hard time I would forget what was literally just taught to me. Since I been off of it now for about 6 months things have returned back to normal except for my vocabulary and spelling.,1,57
Gabapentin,"This pill is AMAZING!!!... I took gabapentin today for the 1st time I honestly am not a pill person I take a pain relief pill once in a blue for a headache so I honestly had no idea it even existed much less what it did how it made you feel etc. but I awoke just as depressed as I fell asleep so I took a look at the bottle &amp; said what they hay, an hour later I felt like a million bucks I was back to my old self talking &amp; smiling being productive no stress &amp; anxiety just cool calm &amp; collected So much so my bff made the comment it's great to have you back where have you been girl....",10,108

Gabapentin,"Ok,   its funny i found this page because  its perfect for what I want to say.  I'm Diabetic and my foot doc gave me Gabapnetin for the pain  and burning sensation in my feet.   He gave me 300 mg and to take it 3 times daily.    But I admit I now take 1500  mg at one shot in the morning.  ( He said I can take more than what he gave me but he didn't get a chance to give me a new script.   Anyway,   it helps with my feet maybe 65%   or so but  don't care what anyone says   no slurring, no falling a sleep or nodding out etc...)   Its great and EFFECTIVE...",8,68
Gabapentin,"This medication is hopefully going to replace the clonazapam that I am currently taking. I have only been taking it a week but I have already felt some changes. My mood is happier, my anxiety is relieved. I feel my energy has improved, (sometimes a little too much) I get pretty chatty and when I have a few things to do, I have a tough time concentrating on just one and I find myself kind of bouncing around if that make sense..I have always been that way it seems like the meds have intensified it. I sometimes have a little trouble gathering my thoughts. The dose in the morning  sometimes makes me sleepy so then I just drink like 2 red bulls and a monster and i'm good.;) Totally kidding!!!. I don't  drink caffeine.  Btw, I am taking 300 mg x3",8,107
Gabapentin,"My Anxiety and panic attacks were so bad I had a hard time leaving the house, I still take Xanax and clonazapan, but with Gabapentin added it really made a difference. Im able to go out and shop with no problems now, first time in years I was able to drive into the big city.",10,131

Gabapentin,"I went to a neurologist for nerves...like a live wire that started buzzing in my body 24/7. It wasn't painful, but annoying and concerning since it started up one day and it's been over a year. I'm getting testing done to rule out any physiological issues, but in the meantime, my doctor prescribed me Gabapentin 300 mg, 3x/day. Wow! I love this drug. I'm calmer, happier, and also have an increased sex drive. Works great for anxiety too. Didn't do much for my insomnia. Time seems to stand still though which is strange, but I don't mind. I can tell when I need another dose to calm my 'buzzing' feeling as it wears off after about 4 hours. My appetite was not affected and I did not gain weight.",8,99
Gabapentin,"I have been taking gabapentin...for awhile now. Me &amp; my husband both. And it works wonders with our depression, anxiety. It also keeps us from craving drugs or alcohol.  It helps with my social anxiety as well. We think its a miracle drug. As far as we're concerned.",10,133
Gabapentin,"Battled with anxiety and depression for almost 30 years now.  Was on Xanax but got addicted to it and ended up in hospital recently.  Tapered me off the Xanax and gave me Gabapentin 600mgs twice a day.  Started seeing a difference in a few days, amazing.  Works better on my anxiety than any benzo that I have been on.  And I have been on most of them at one point or another.  I wake up in a good mood.  The only drawback that I have is that the morning dose makes me sleepy til about 11an but that is it.  But I am not complaining because I would rather be sleepy than anxious and depressed.",9,139
Gabapentin,I was given this medication to treat anxiety and panic attacks. It has not helped me despite increasing the dosage to 900mg a day.  It's always so disappointing when the hope of relief from a new medicine leads nowhere.,2,35
Gabapentin,"I have suffered from Depression/Anxiety for over 10 years, no medication has worked in the past. I thought I would have to live the rest of my being depressed. I gave up on all medications and at times wished I was dead. I would have to say Gabapentin is my miracle pill. This has truly worked for me I have to say I am happy I took this pill.",10,154
Gabapentin,"I was prescribed gabapintin for ongoing depression, ptsd, &amp; nerve disruption from disease treatment.

Gabapentin,"I was given this med for my TN pain, after I went to my dentist and he found nothing wrong with my teeth. That same day, my dentist called my GP and my GP got me in right away. I was sent for facial x-rays to check for sinus infection, nothing, so my GP made several calls and got me into a neurologist, in the mean time he asked her what he could give me for pain since at this point I had lost 10 lbs and was missing work. They put me on Gabapentin and Amitriptyline. It took a couple of days, but wow, when it started to work it was AMAZING for pain relief. They have upped me to 600mg 3 x a day and now at about three everyday I am a little high. But, the best side effect ever has to be that my anxiety, period cramp pain and insomnia are gone!",10,66
Gabapentin,"I was prescribed gabapentin for back surgery pain, and nerve pain from diabetes...  I'm on the max dose, 1200 mg 3 times a day... All I can say is thank you Load for freeing me up from the opiates!  My mood is great, I sleep well and my pain has diminished by 75%! I am 63 years old, forced to retire due to excessive back pain (3 surgeries, one spinal fusion) and very bad nerve pain in my feet and hands...

I did not feel much relief from this dose and it was upped to 300 mg 3/day. It's been 4 months and I have since had to increase to 600 mg 3/day and it's  been really working for me. I do not have many side effects. I can tell if I miss a dose as withdrawal symptoms come rather quickly. I have not gained or lost weight. I am not overly tired and it does not make me feel restless.

Gabapentin,Gabapentin has been working wonders for my anxiety and fibromyalgia or maybe it's just because I CANT STAY AWAKE LONG ENOUGH TO FEEL A DAMN THING. I hate the living hell out of this pill I have been trying to tapper off of it for weeks now and I'm in hell. Extreme abdominal pain. Can't actually sleep longer then 2 hours at a time and when I'm awake I feel like death. I can't focus or remember anything at all. This is truly hell,3,61

Gabapentin,"70 yrs old. Have suffered from depression-bipolar since 17. Have been treated with tens of medications to no avail, except lithium for 43 yrs which no longer works. 4 yrs ago I was treated with Gabapentin, which seemed to decrease the depression already after initial dose of 300mg. Increased to 3*300mg to which I reacted well until general anaesthetic in dec 2015 for operation threw me into a deep depression. Any info on effect of anaesthetic on depression and any antidote?",10,42

He said it would make me really tired, as I am also on methadone. But I took the one before I was gonna go to bed, and I cannot sleep at all. I am so anxious and on edge right now.. This medication is definitely not for me...I took it a couple hours ago and I'm thinking about making myself puke because its time release so maybe  it's not all in me yet? That is how bad this anxiety is.  And since I'm on methadone, I no longer am prescribed Valium. So this really sucks as I don't have anything to take this edge off.",1,28

I've always been somewhat depressed and anxious... I got a side effect I did not bargain for.  Not only did it help my pain, but my mood has been the best it has in years!  I feel happy!!! Calmer.  I can tell as soon as I miss a dose because my mood changes.  I Hope my doctor lets me take this once my pain is gone.

I began having really bad anxiety and depression...this was also aided by the death of my mother and 3 cousins I was close to.  In any case, it got worse and worse..my doctor doesn't believe in diazapam etc which I think it's a personal thing with her. So I'm changing doctors but can't get in till February.  A friend had a big bottle of Gabapentin after his dog died and told me it had a sedative effect. I hadn't slept more that 1-2 hours a night in months.  I took a 300 mg of Gabapentin  at night for 4 nights, since then I have slept through the night!!! This was HUGE for me..I've only taken it for 4 days... And it's like a miracle",9,83

If I do not take it or if I'm getting close to my next dose. I start to feel depressed. I love taking this. It really does help for headache pain, and mood. I got this for depression. Because i do suffer from depression and anxiety a lot. It seems to help with the depression but not anxiety. If anything it makes me more happier. More calmer and more relaxed.

I enjoy being relaxed and feeling calm.",10,129
Gabapentin,"I am 40 years old. I have dealt with social anxiety since my teen years. I have been on Wellbutrin XR 150 mg twice daily for several months, which has given me energy, improved mood, and increase sex drive. I started gabapentin a couple weeks ago for pain relief related to a slipped disc impinging nerves in my back, sciatica. I am taking 600 mg tthree times a day. I am amazed!! Social anxiety is gone! First time in my life. I have actually been chatty and social without breaking into a sweat from nerves. Also haven't reached for my when required Ativan at all since starting gabapentin. I couldn't be happier about this accidental discovery. Life changing. Also note that I am a recovering alcoholic. Maybe defective gaba has been the culprit?",10,137
Gabapentin,"I am a recovering drug addict suffering from severe anxiety. My drug of choice was benzos so clearly I cannot be prescribed those (or any other narcotics). While I was in rehab I was prescribed gabapentin, 300 mg pill three times a day. I was convinced that it wouldn't work because it was a non narcotic but this drug has helped me so much, I feel like I have complete control over my anxiety. However when I miss A dose or two in a day I do have withdrawal symptoms.. as long as I take it as prescribed I feel amazing with almost no side effects.",10,110
Gabapentin,"I have degenerative disc disease, sciatica, fibromyalgia, a bulging disc and chronic back pain. I have been on gabapentin for almost 3 years now. I also suffer from generalized anxiety disorder and bipolar 1. This medication is a miracle. I feel better in all aspects. It helps with everything. I'm prescribed 600 mg 3 times per day. I use to be on 900 mg 3 times per day. Was too much. I'm in a much better mood my back feels ten times better and my fibro doesn't flare up as much. I would recommend it to anyone who suffers with these conditions.",9,91
Gabapentin,"Was prescribed this med years ago for anxiety.   I take 300 mg three times per day. morning, noon, and night.The  doctor is about to up the dose a bit because I've been on the same dose for so long, and sometimes I get extra anxious or can't sleep so asked if I could have the option to take an extra when I need it. This medication is amazing... I can't say enough about it to be honest. It has helped me so much live my life without that constant nagging anxiety, social awkwardness, and it helps regulate my moods as well !",9,105
Gabapentin,"Ok, Gabapentin worked fine for me for anxiety. But I was un aware of the ridiculous side effects it comes with.  I was 160lb male, which I was happy with. Unexpectedly I kept gaining weight that I was un aware of.  From 160lbs, now I'm 245lbs!!! That's 85lbs I gained within just 8 months!! I tried to stop taking it for just 1 day, and I went into SEVERE withdrawal. It felt worse than both opiate and benzo withdrawal!! Stay away from this drug!",1,66
Gabapentin,"Gabapentin is a miracle worker. While I was suffering with depression and severe anxiety, I was against taking any type of medications to help me however things were starting to get out control. I am very happy with how things are now. My mood swings are finally under control and I am to think clearer than ever before.",9,94
Gabapentin,"I have GAD stemming from PTSD due to trauma in my past. I've been taking all sorts of medication for it for years, including Klonopin which I did not realize was habit forming until after I started taking it. Then, last year, I switched doctors, and she refuses to prescribe benzos, especially since I had a problem with alcohol abuse. Last month, she prescribed me Neurontin and I thought it wouldn't work, so I put off getting the script filled. But then it got to the point where I couldn't live with the anxiety so I went and got the script filled just to give it a shot and I'm so amazed at the difference it makes. I do not feel anxiety at all anymore and even though it makes me kind of foggy, I can still function. I love this med.",10,106

Gabapentin,"Gabapentin has been a miracle drug for me! I first started it 3 years ago for restless leg syndrome (which felt like painful electric shocks deep inside my legs.) It worked perfectly. I took 300 mg an hour before bed. About a year ago, I started having hot flashes (I'm 52) Instead of HRT, my doctor increased my dose to 600 mg a day, in divided doses, and my hot flashes are much better. Then, 6 months ago, I became the target of a bully in the workplace and my anxiety soared! I found it nearly impossible to concentrate and it was increasingly difficult to function at all! After increasing my dose to 600 mg three times a day, I am able to breeze through my work day and I'm no longer intimidated by the bully!",10,107
Gabapentin,"I started taking Gabapentin three months ago for bulging disc and nerve pain. I'm currently on 300mg a day. This dosage helps about 90% of the time for pain. But I've always suffered from social anxiety. I noticed after taking Gabapentin for maybe a month or so that my crazy, continuous worries were going away. Now three months in, I feel so bubbly and chatty, and not afraid to talk to people, and I'm not afraid to take part in social activities that used to terrify me. I was reading about Gabapentin online, and when I found out that it's sometime prescribed for anxiety, it hit me: Wow. Since I've been taking this, I've been feeling so much better. This drug is amazing. I feel like now I'm the person I was always supposed to be.",9,152

Gabapentin,"Where do I begin. My whole life I have had severe anxiety. Later down the road came despression and a mood disorder. My anxiety controlled me. I would have panic attacks more than once a day, terrified to leave my house, scared to talk to friends/family, scared to go to work and anything else you can think of. I've tried, since I was 15; I'm now 22, Xanax,Lorazapam,Clonazapam and Valium to the point where I wouldnt know how many I was taking a day. NOTHING helped!! I had a different doctor see me and her first choice was Gabapentin 300mg, 1 capsule 3 times a day. And thats where the miracle began! My life was changed. Im getting goose bumps now looking back on how much relief I felt and still feel! The world was different. Please try it! (:",10,211
Gabapentin,"15 years old, severe anxiety.  My Dr. prescribed this medication for me to take on occasion when I needed it.  It worked beautifully, and I could go to dances and loud bars and restaurants again.  Although it did not removed my anxiety completely, it did get rid of at least 90%, and that was enough to get me through these situations.  However, very recently I have noticed that it has stopped working and instead gives me horrible dizziness and lets my anxiety roam free.  I do take another medication for anxiety as well as another for depression.  Anyhow, my gabapentin has been fought off by my body and I am going to have to switch meds again (I was on another medicine that I became immune to 4 months ago and have to switch then).  Sigh.",8,36

I take a beta-blocker which slows my heart rate, but I still felt really anxious and panicky all the time! I'm also on methadone so my Dr. Would not prescribe me any benzos for my anxiety for fear I would get addicted to them! She tried every kind of antidepressant but none really worked. Just. A few months ago she prescribed me 1x300mg 3x a day of gabapentin, and now my anxiety is completely under control I, feel like I have a new lease on life ,and feel much more comfortable in my own skin.",8,112
Gabapentin,I've suffered from bi polar and depression for years . I was on lexapro for over a decade and cymbalta for a bit. Weaned myself off of everything and tried natural stuff like holy basil and lithium oratate. The natural stuff mildly helped but I still had crazy mood swings.  For many of my earlier years I battled with alcohol and did about any drug to alleviate and forget a childhood with and alcoholic father and crazy mother. One day at work my neck was out the pain unbearable co worker gave me a few lyrica pills. It eased the pain but after taking them for 2 days I realized I felt balanced and calm for the first time in years.  I told my Dr and he  prescribed gabapentin. My son suffered for yrs. If only I been on it sooner he'd had a happier life.,0,96
Gabapentin,"In 2013 I had 16 E.R visits, 11 EKG's and 4 times the paramedics came to get me. This was all due to panic disorder/attacks. This started as a child due to abuse but by the time I turned 9 the panic attacks had subsided, but eventually showed back up when I turned about 27 out of no where. I took SEVERAL other meds but this one has helped me greatly! I would like to say that if you are dealing with severe anxiety check to see if you have an iron deficiency also check for heavy metals and toxins. I was severely anemic and had a build of heavy metals. Once I detoxed my body and changed my diet my panic attacks and depression went away! I no longer have to take this med.",7,82
Gabapentin,"I have to agree with so many people who have given positive reviews  for gabapentin. I take 300 mg four times daily, and I am living in peace and can live comfortably in my skin for the first time in my life. I am much more productive, happy, and things just roll off my back that usually would cause me great anger or disruption. I noticed that I sleep better too. What I  like is that this medication does not drug me up the way so many other medicines that I've tried for anxiety have done. I also take it for severe lower back pain, and it helps a great deal as well. I recommend this to anybody who is thinking of trying it.",10,136
Gabapentin,"I have been hiv positive for 3 years when I asked my doctor if my hiv meds were actually giving me side effects of anxiety and panic attacks. I am taking truvada and isentress and although I am very happy with my meds, I really noticed that When I started the hiv meds, I become  very anxious and paranoid of negative things happening in my daily life. I talked to my doctor and so he prescribed me a very low dosage of 100 milligrams 4 capsules a day of Gabapentin. I immediately noticed the effects within the first week. I am no longer paranoid, worrysome and anxious all the time. I'm very happy my doctor prescribed me this medicine. :)",10,86

Always had mood problems, always thought it was simply my genetics and just got on with it (as you do), never had the guts to see the doctor but my mood drastically improved after taking the gabapentin. My back is better now but after a chat with the doc he's kept me on 3x300mg/day. If I forget to take them its back to being miserable.

But I also take ambient,and clonazepam also at night.I am also an addict,but I do not abuse these 3 meds. I had a problem with pain killers and xanax.which now I take subutek to help with the cravings for these 2 meds. And I will say if you take them like your prescribed then they Will help you.

Gabapentin,I am a 70 yr old woman &amp; have had anxiety &amp; depression my whole life. This medication has changed my life. I took it initially for shingles but noticed immediately that my anxiety was gone so I phoned my psychiatrist (I am bipolar) &amp; asked to be put on it.  He agreed no problem. I take 300 mg 3 times a day. I hope this helps others with anxiety &amp; depression. I am like a new woman!,10,182
Gabapentin,"Following surgery for prostate cancer, and 3 months later possibility of duodenal cancer ( biopsy tested negative) however surgery recommended; I was having severe anxiety &amp; panic attacks. This lasted 3 1/2 years, during which I tried numerous SSRI's &amp; SNRI's all with no effect. In fact it made it worse, e.g. Suicidal ideation, greater bouts of anxiety, headaches, diarrhea. Ativan did help significantly, but all the negativity started to raise my anxiety just taking it. I finally jut took it despite all this negativity. Thankfully, my p Doc continued my prescription and I was able to live a better quality of life.  I then was asked to try an off label Medication ... Gabapentin. After 2weeks it did wonders!! Highly recommend!!",9,101

Fear and panic and sadness has made me a shell of the woman, mom, and wife I once was. I also have reoccurring shingles. I have tried numerous anti anxiety medications with little relief. The gabapentin was prescribed to help with my neuropathic pain (which it has helped significantly), the wonderful side effect has been that my anxiety is almost nonexistant and I am able to live my active life again. I take up to 300 mg up to 3 times a day. I have been taking it more like 200 mg morning and afternoon.",10,126
Gabapentin,"I am about to start this tomorrow.   i found this page and am thinking how rare it is to see so much positive feedback compared to other things i've researched.    I hope it helps me.    the ssri's have always made things worse and i gave up long ago.     Only reason I am trying this is b/c nothing will control my blood pressure and the cardiologist thinks the roots are in anxiety/panic.    Ten years of my life have been limited and like a prison.   I see encouragement here.   I have tried to avoid any medication, but I am getting older now and have to give it another shot.    I finally found a dr that seemed to understand and not treat me like a nut case.    Generally, going to any dr's office is an ordeal for me and in full blown panic",0,118

So for the last month I tapered myself off of the Xanax and Clonazepam and was subsequently put on Gapapentin and I have to say I've never felt better. This medication has been the only thing that has helped as much as the better than Benzo's. I must say this medication really is a miracle anxiety drug.

I take 3 x 300mg Gabapentin a day and my anxiety has certainly decreased quite significantly. I still have the occasional 'black cloud' day, but I can honestly say these tablets have definately tsken the edge off it. I sleep better, have not gained weight and do not feel like a zombie. For me, Gabapentin has been a good alternative to usual antidepressants.",8,136
Gabapentin,"I have been on gabapentin about 2 yrs. I take it with Wellbutrin, since Wellbutrin by itself, just causes too much anxiety for me. It is wonderful, helps the anxiety, and moods, relaxes and calms me, yet doesn't make me real tired. I take 300mg x 3, which is 900 mg a day, and it is perfect, if I need an extra one, I take it, since my script is for 4 a day, and I only take 3. Good stuff. Oh, also, it helps with some of my muscle pain as well. Another thing I've noticed, it decreases my appetite, and I lose weight, my weight stays stable.",9,131

So far life is good and I hope this is the miracle drug I've been longing for.",8,163
Gabapentin,"I have been on Neurontin for a month now.  This medicine was given to me for chronic neck pain from an injury 30 years ago.  I did not mention to the neurologist that I suffered from severe anxiety and panic disorder, I was taking at least 1 dose of Xnax daily for daily panic attacks.  Since starting on neurontin I have only had to take Xanax 1 time, I am not in chronic pain any longer.  This medication has changed my life in so many ways.  My husband told me in tears that he has his wife back.   My work has completely changed around, I love my job again, I love life again, and I am pain free!!!!!!",10,212
Gabapentin,"Please don't take this medication. I have anxiety and fibromyalgia and I am prescribed 800 MG three times a day. Due to circumstances beyond my control, I ran out of Neurontin 5 days ago. The withdrawal has been terrible. I know, Neurontin doesn't cause withdrawal symptoms but it does, and I've read all over the internet that I am not alone. I have quit opiate pain killers cold turkey and over came a severe cocaine addiction in my youth, these things are child's play compared to not having Neurontin. I was sweating, shivering, constipated, and the anxiety made me consider checking into a psych ward and asking them to throw away the key, I cried for hours, I can't express how horrific it was and I read it can last a year!",1,83

However, after about a year, it started making me feel dizzy, disoriented and lightheaded at only 600 mg, so I started to use it for sleep.

It's non narcotic, and a blessing.",10,189
Gabapentin,"I've been dealing with anxiety my entire adult life (I'm 29). Finally, after a long period of unemployment, I was able to get insurance, and began seeing a psychiatrist. Despite complaining about panic attacks, he prescribed Wellbutrin (buproprion) for my depression (which I'm realizing is more likely ADHD-PI, so the doc was at least half right in prescribing the bupropion.). This greatly exacerbated my anxiety, to the point I was having more panic attacks in a week than I was previously having in a month. With gabapentin 3x100mg daily, as needed, that's no longer the case. My quality of life is much improved.",10,76
Gabapentin,"Never though of reviewing a med, I do this just for Gabapentin being so great. I've tryed a lot before: Zoloft, Remeron, all types of benzos. I've kept a very bad opinion on them all, especially SSRi's - damn soul and sex killers. Benzos get addictive in the long run. But Gabapentin works like a charm, literally. Takes the edgyness of the days away, most inhibitions and anxiety, gives me the drive to do things and enjoy what i'm doing, I got faithful and... happy (after I almost forgot how it can be constantly felt). FInal note: if taken not too often (like once a week) it can be quite recreational in doses around 1200 mg. I usually take about 600-900 daily, but cut off some times to get the higher reward days later, as tolerance drops.",9,60
Gabapentin,"I am 25 years old and I have suffered from social anxiety for my whole life. To cope with anxiety I became addicted to opiates. I am now in rehab and my doctor has changed my meds many times. I have been on gabapentin for almost a month I don't feel any changes yet. She says it may take up to a month for this medicine to start working. I am on 300 mg three times a day A long with other antidepressants and Suboxone to treat my opiate addiction. I wish I could get on Xanax because it is the only thing that helps with my anxiety, but because I am an addict my doctor will not prescribe me any medications that I may become addicted to or I should say that give me a high sort of feeling. The only difference is I feel like a zombie.",3,21
Gabapentin,"I am 43. I started taking Gabapentin for neuropathy in my feet, 500mg a day. It really took the tingly pain away. When I was diagnosed with prostate cancer last year, I stopped it, since I was on so many painkillers I didn't think I needed it. Then I began to experience severe anxiety and hopelessness, racing negative thoughts, I didn't know what to do. I had heard that Gabapentin helped with anxiety, so I went back on it, and it is INCREDIBLE! at 600mg a day, I feel calm, chatty, and able to live in the moment. I'm a little clumsy, but I am SO grateful that Gabapentin has this mood stabilizing effect on me, and it worked the first day back on it. Now I can just live my life without anxiety, and I can take less narcotics now too, yet feel even better!",10,93
Gabapentin,"Have tried every antidepressant on the planet, not working for anxiety. My doc gave me gabapenton 300mg twice a day, no help. I tried by mistake (long story) 600mg at once and it works! I discovered it works for about 6 hours, so now I take 600mg twice a day. That gets me through the day. I pray it keeps working.",10,110
Gabapentin,"Very good medicine. Taking 200 to 300mg daily for anxiety, racing thoughts, poor sleep etc.  Have been on lamotrigine and risperidone for supposed BPD for years. Everything they can't get rid of, gabapentin does.  Never realized there was still so much room for improvement!  One other thing.  For me, MSG or any free glutamate sets off severe anxiety and migraines.  Some of you may have similar problem, so think about your diet too.   For me gabapentin provides fast relief from a 'meal mistake'.  Benzodiazepines worked pretty well for me, but now that I have this, bye bye. I used to use alcohol more than I should, but now don't feel the need too.",9,133

Gabapentin,"I have been on Neurontin for 3 months now for anxiety. I started at 100 mg 3x a day and now at 600 mg 3x a day and very happy with that dose. I very rarely have to take my Vistaril. Before taking this my anxiety got so severe that I actually feared planes crashing on top of me every time I heard one go by. I only experienced mild sedation when I started it and it is gone now. No other side effects. It may not work for everyone, but I would definitely recommend giving it a try to anyone who's doctor recommends it!",10,95
Gabapentin,"I started off with a relatively low dose of 300mg once a day.  After starting the medication,  I began to pass out regularly and could not see straight.  My anxiety did not change.  I returned to my psychiatrist and he lowered the dosage to 100mg, once a day and although I no longer experience side effects, I still have not noticed any changes to my anxiety and suffer anxiety attacks daily.",4,70
Gabapentin,After a hard divorce at a young age I became an addict meds. When I searched for help I found an amazing doctor that I feel cares about my well being not just there to give me meds. One of the medications he had given me was Neurontin(gabapentin) and it has helped not only with my anxiety but I also get horrible sciatic nerve pain ( when I'm sitting for long periods of time and at night when I'm sleeping) it has helped so much. I can take it during the day which helps my anxiety and at night helps me get a good night sleep as well as the nerve pain. I would recommend this medication for anyone struggling with these issues. I hope this helped just one person.,9,291
Gabapentin,I am 42 yes old and have had social anxiety my whole life. It's been hard to deal with. I became an addict because I couldn't cope. After serving in the military I went to the VA for help. I was on so many medicines I can't remember them all. Gabapentin has changed my life. Been completely clean for years and no anxiety.,10,259
Gabapentin,"In one day I felt so much better! No jitters, nervousness and no pain. I used to shake when anxiety was high, so much I hurt everywhere!

It's a stoned feeling at first then you get used to it.",10,178
Gabapentin,I'm an MST and PTSD survivor and this stuff along with Lyrica restored me in about a week. Medication that affects SSRI cannot even compare when it comes to treating my condition. I feel like myself again! I don't even need alcohol anymore! I'm still depressed but I can finally breathe again without having a panic attack. Highly recommended to those with severe anxiety or Post traumatic stress disorder. The side effects are mundane at best.,9,180
Gabapentin,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder survivor! Thriver now! This medicine gave me my life back! Only side effect so far is depression if I come down for too long. DR adjusted my dose and its perfect.,10,103
Gabapentin,I've been taking Gabapentin 100MG twice daily for 3 weeks now for generalized anxiety and don't feel much of an improvement. Next time I see my psychiatrist I will ask for an increase in my dosage and maybe that will help.,6,56
Gabapentin,"I have found both Neurontin and generic Gabapentin to be very useful for treating my anxiety disorder. For me, I would not use anything else. It works well for my mother too. I am so glad it is in my life and so are my family and friends.",0,127
Gabapentin,"I wasn't sure about how anxious I was on a daily basis. I tried to self medicate with nicotine and caffeine but the caffeine just added to my anxiety..I was put on 100mg twice a day as needed. I like this med. My anxiety has decreased by at least 30 to 40%. Just after my first dose. I am going to take gabapentin every 8 hours from now on. That should cover me during the day at evening. That leaves me with 8 hours of sleep in which I don't need the medication. My doc said I can take up to 200mg at a time but I am not sure if I am going to do that. I don't wanna be on such a high dose. Things are slightly better than they were before I took the pill and for now, it's all I need.",9,69
Gabapentin,"I took one pill and had more anxiety than normal, did not help pain and lay in bed awake all night. Took it again..... Same thing. More anxiety than normal and muscle spasms are horribly intense. I will be calling my doctor Monday. This medicine did the opposite of what it was supposed to. It is definitely not for me.",0,100
Gabapentin,"I have been on Neurontin since 1997 (2500 mg) for generalized anxiety. Just fear of doing anything. I think most reading this get it without me going into great detail. Buspar was not helpful. My psychiatrist was reluctant to use benzodiazepiness because of alcohol abuse issues. I am on mood stabilizing medicines, and antidepressants and had been for 7 years before my life saving. It took me three months to believe the anxiety wouldn't return as a 24/365 nightmare. I didn't know how bad it was until it stopped.",10,246
Gabapentin,I have had to be patient for a while with this pill. I was prescribed at 14 for this medicine and sometimes I would still get anxiety attacks at around 15 it started to help including my weekly therapy appointments. Gabapentin used to sometimes make me jittery if I didn't eat before I took them. I also don't like going a day without them. They have helped now after 2 years of taking them and I'm used to them but the beginning side effects really kicked in for me. I don't think I will be able to stop taking them either. I don't know but for now I will continue going to therapy and taking them.,7,66
Gabapentin,"I was hospitalized with severe depression and social anxiety, generalized anxiety and bipolar. Gabapentin introduced  (300 3x day) with Zoloft and Vistaril (which I had to discontinue as I had severe symptoms) Helps alot...but I still have difficulty going in public..ever. Also, the teeth grinding is so intense that my teeth are VISIBLY shorter and shorn to the same length.  I also  have jaw pain related, sweating, and very blurred vision. Terrible CONSTANT dry mouth and throat. Right now, the positives outweigh the negative? But just barely.  I'm not sure If I will continue this or not.  The improvement in outlook is phenomenal, but I know its not real recovery and the side effects are just short of unbearable.",7,71
Gabapentin,"I have taken Neurontin for 5 days now..400 mg 4 times a day. It is like a miracle medicine for me. I was drinking 18-24 beers a day..one 10 mg Valium, lots of coffee and smoking 1 1/2 - 2 Packs of cigarettes a day. Anxiety levels were High. I feel rested, calm, clear headed and No anxiety. It's been 20 years since I have felt this good. I drank a lot and took a lot of nerve pills. I went to rehab for 3 days. Doctor put me on Neurontin 1600 daily. I feel a little sluggish, but that is a lot better than the way I felt a week ago. I have No caffeine, cigarettes, valium or alcohol. I have saved a lot of money now. ($30) a day habit. I do wear a 21 mg patch though.  Please give this Drug a try. Get the right dosage for you will help a lot.",10,230
Gabapentin,"I'm on gabapentin for a couple of weeks now, I get prescribed 0.5 of risperidone,  30 mg of mirtazapine,  and 15 mg a of diazepam/Vallium a day. I am diagnosed to autism and suffer from depression and anxiety,  I took this and felt happy.",0,93
Gabapentin,"In 2012, I was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder from trauma from 9-11-01 events in New York City. I had lived with PTSD for over 10 years unknowingly. Two different doctors put me on anti-depressants because I did not sleep well. All 3 (Zoloft, Amitriptyline, and Trazodone) worsened my mood. I did not have clinical depression; i.e., did not have trouble getting out of bed. A third doctor prescribed gabapentin. I am less reactive, feel more social, and generally more happy. Also, if I wait to take a dose, I can feel the onset of anxiety, unlike in the last 12 years, which is helpful for practicing sensory emotional regulation. With the ability to feel when anxiety sets, I can practice the technique. I hope to be off medication soon.",10,119
Gabapentin,I was taking Lamictal and Klonopin for a long time and doing very well on it.   In 2010 I had to have a lumbar disk replacement from an old hockey injury in college.  Sadly I got hooked on pain pills and when I finally stopped I was spending about 5k to 6k a month on pills which indicates how much I was taking.  Since about Xmas of 2013 I have been going through a period of Major Depression and Severe anxiety.  I just kept getting worse and worse and the Klonopin/Lamictal stopped working.  I had a prescription of Gabapentin sitting in my drawer that I had been prescribed but stopped using because it was making me dizzy.  I decided to try it our of desperation and all I can say is wow.  My anxiety has gone from a 10 to a 2 and no side effects.,9,217
Gabapentin,"I have generalized anxiety disorder and have been on SSRI's and Benzodiazepines. The SSRI's made me manic. Zoloft, Buspar, Paxil...etc. I have been in 2 treatment programs and the hospital for harmful thoughts over the last 5 years. My doctor put me on Gabapentin and seemed to work real well. Then a follow up doc took me off and said I had to take an antidepresseant and Xanax to help me sleep. Huge mistake. Well I went back on the Gabapentin then off again because I thought it was causing a problem but it was really the Xanax. Now, I have been put back on it 300mg 3x a day. I also take a low dose of Remeron and trazodone to help me sleep. I think it is a good medication for anxiety and I hope this time I get good results like I did the first time I was on it.",9,135
Gabapentin,"I have never in my 30 years of living been so happy &amp; alive thanks to the gabapentin and lithium my psychiatrist put me on almost 3 months ago. Going back to my inpatient stay in March- I was suicidal because I didn't think there was any other way out of the pain and burden of being anxious 24/7. It paralyzed me. I felt helpless. Now, I go to the gym, play with my son more, preform better at work, and all my relationships are much better. I can actually think to communicate. Also, I don't go from 0 to 60 in 2 seconds anymore. I'm like I got this. Just breathe I can't even make myself anxious anymore. I've tried. I am on 3000mg a day of Gabapentin (5-600mg pills a day) and 600mg of Lithium (2-300mg pills a day). True Happiness!",10,193
Gabapentin,"I was originally prescribed Gabapentin for internal nerve damage due to extensive colon cancer surgery. It has been about 75% effective in relieving this pain. To my surprise, it has also helped in other ways I was never expecting.  I have a pretty laid back personality (I thought) but after taking Gabapentin for pain relief, I began noticing a calming effect overtake me  - just relaxed.  I used to get lots of negative thoughts come to my mind which I would fight off but now I don't even go there!  My husband has really noticed a difference in my upbeat attitude towards life and after a year of radiation, chemo, surgery etc... it is a wonderful surprise to him also! As a side note - I am also sleeping great and wake up refreshed.",9,194
Gabapentin,"I have had periodic depression for years, and general anxiety problems as well, lately they had been getting worse. I cannot tolerate the SSRI anti-depressants, can't even tell any effect when I take Buspar, was taking Clonazepam when things got really bad. I went back to see a Dr. I have great respect for, had another QEEG, he said I have a fast brain (Gross CNS hyperarousal). Started me on 300 mg Gabapentin at bedtime.  Noticed a calming, mellowing effect the first day. Before I could not stop my mind from racing, from obsessing, and would get almost paralyzed to do anything. I feel so much better, my mind is calm, depression is lifted, and no side effects other than a very, very slight fogginess. So far, for me - amazing.",10,290
Gabapentin,"When my doctor first prescribed gabapentin, normally a seizure medicine, for my anxiety, I was a little confused. She explained to me that if you look at 2 brain scans, one patient with seizures, and one with anxiety, the damage in their brain is very similar. Within a week, I was able to feel a dramatic difference with my anxiety. Within a month, I truly felt normal again. I LOVE what this medication does for me, and it's made a huge impact on my daily life.  I take one 300mg tablet in the morning, and two at night, and I have a very mild twitch that it's also helped to relieve as an extra plus.",10,207
Gabapentin,"I took Gabapentin for the usual depression/anxiety combination. It helped my anxiety SO much and I was a new person on it. The only reason I had to go off of it was because I have Interstitial Cystitis and the Gabapentin acted as a bladder irritant to my condition. Other than it worsened my interstitial cystitis, this medication was pretty flawless.",6,100
Gabapentin,"I was prescribed Gabapentin for anxiety/depression, after trying amitryptylline and citalopram, both of which did not work. My dose was 300mg Gabapentin 3x a day, however, this dose was causing me to have really achey joints so I stopped taking the evening one and now have one when I get up, and one at lunchtime. I can really feel the effects of the morning one, as, an hour after taking it I feel a little light headed and drunk, but very focused and determined. I am also sleeping better as my head isn't full of worries when I go to sleep like it used to be. Gabapentin does not make you feel sluggish and zombie-like like other meds, in fact I find them to be the opposite - I get loads done in a day which also helps me sleep.",8,166
Gabapentin,Best anti-anxiety medicine yet.,10,126
Gabapentin,"Gabapentin has been a life saver for me. I have suffered from dysthemia and anxiety for my entire 47 years of existence. I've been on every medicine they could toss at me over the years but nothing helped with my symptoms. Then I had back surgery for a discotomy on L5 on my spine. I had severe leg pain and the sciatica pain was very intense. The doctor prescribed gabapentin for residual nerve pain in my left foot. Without gabapentin my foot feels like its on fire but I also discovered how different I was beginning to feel with my depression and anxiety....I felt alive for the first time in decades. I kid you not, it is a wonderful and my doctor has been recording my progress on it with my depression and anxiety. Great medicine.",10,215
Gabapentin,"I was on gabapentin when I was younger around age 16 to 18 and I remembered it must had worked pretty well because I stayed on for a little while. So fast forward almost ten years and I started seeing doctor again due to social anxiety and asked if I could try gabapentin. I started low 100mg at night which actually did help me sleep and felt calming effect but I did notice a little twitchy, but all in all it was ok the problem was the next day my anxiety seemed a lot worse I even tried couple more nights and same thing always happened. I'd have physical effect of anxiety, pounding heart, etc. I am also on methadone so I don't know if this why this medication made me have such bad anxiety next day but everyone is different.",6,50
Gabapentin,"I suffer from generalzed anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and panic disorder. I have been on Neurontin for about three months. At first I was on 300mg/day, and now am on 600mg/day. My doctor wants to ultimately get me up to 900mg/day. This medicine works great. It keeps me on a calm and even keel, plus eliminates some of my physical anxiety symptoms. The only side effect I experienced was some slight clumsiness at first, which disappeared after a few days. I also take Tenormin and Prozac.",10,96
Gabapentin,"I just started Gabapentin 300mg Feb 28th and am titrating down of off Lexapro. It started making my anxiety go through the roof. I am also on Buspar, Lamictal and Zoloft. I suffer from post traumatic stress disorder and am in recovery x5 years from Alcoholism. Without medication my life is unmanageable. So far I feel great, not sure if its because I am lowering my Lexapro and will be off this Friday. Or if it's the Gabapentin. I am hoping this works.",6,50
Gabapentin,"I have had panic attacks since I was four, I am 33 now. I was an alcoholic four 10 years cause I was on a high dose of Xanax and I got hooked then my doctor put me on Klonopin because it is a longer lasting medicine.

Gabapentin,"I am 47 with such an exhausting history of anxiety that had led me to self medicate with alcohol, until finally finding the correct medical doctor. Doctors in the past have been writing me scrips that have been making me crazier  and crazier, just adding to my problem. Now I am alcohol free with no panic attacks, I have no problems being by myself and keeping occupied with work and fun things to do. I sleep like a baby all through the night. It's wonderful.",10,164
Gabapentin,I have just recently started taking this medicine and my anxiety has vanished. I have even tried to make myself anxious and it will not happen. I am satisfied so far.,10,141
Gabapentin,"Until I was fifty I dealt with life, and fear the best I could. Going through catholic school in the sixties was pure hell. But I leaned to deal with generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder the best I could. I become a perfectionist resulting in what others would call a very successful life. At fifty my wife divorced me throwing me into a ten year spin of uncontrollable anxiety. After trying almost every pill made, I tried Gabapentin after one morning and one at lunch. I felt better for the first time in ten years. I have taken for nine months and most of the time I feel better than I have ever felt. A control calm I have never felt. I hope it continues to work.",10,166
Gabapentin,I was started on Neurontin for hot flashes. I am also diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Not only are my hot flashes gone but so is my anxiety! This medicine has been a miracle for me. I have suffered with anxiety almost all of my life and this is the first medication that actually takes away anxiety. It gives me the sense of relaxation and calmness. It's also not addictive.,10,131
Gabapentin,Doses over 2700mg daily completely got rid of the anxiety but gave me severe abdominal cramp.,7,35
Gabapentin,I started 300mg 2x daily for depression and anxiety last Wednesday. All I can say is wow. This stuff is great. I'm back to jogging and daily activities along with my outpatient therapy. This is 5 days removed from suicidal thoughts and almost a 72 hour hold. My doctor is weening me off Valium but I really don't need it but says I have to take it as I ate my whole months script of 60 in 5 days so I'll do what she says. My thoughts and prayers are with all who suffer and if possible give this a try.,10,163
Gabapentin,"I have been on 300mg/day for 14 months. Before, the anxiety was so bad, I seemed to get set off quite easily. Now I am relaxed. It gives this feeling, like okay, whatever, I can handle this. My doctor said I could take more of it if I felt I needed it, but I haven't",9,100
Gabapentin,Going through a real bad bout of depression and anxiety. Was almost hospitalized but am doing outpatient group starting tomorrow. Doctor gave me enough Valium to ween off and gave me Gabapentin today. 300mg twice a day. Took my first one 2 hours ago and feel pretty chill. Also coming off opiates for chronic pain. Very tired but haven't slept much lately. Hopefully with a good nights rest I'll feel more upbeat tomorrow. Also take Effexor and Remeron. Good luck and prayers to all who suffer from emotional issues.,0,89
Gabapentin,"I originally took massive handfuls of this drug for epilepsy over a month a decade or so ago. It was ineffective, but I noticed while I took it the side effect of being happy, sociable, and chatty. Along with other stuff at the massive doses. So fast forward a decade or two, and had unexpected nasty negative life events and became suicidal. Ended up in a psych ward, and I asked for gabapentin.  Started taking a pill morning and evening and the overwhelming suicidal thoughts vanished, the daily crying spells vanished, the intense negative emotion state vanished. Feel calm, cheerful, and happy. My blood pressure went from ultrastress 180/120 with pulse 150 to 120/80 pulse 90. It calms me down and helps me cope when I was feeling overwhelmed",10,136
Gabapentin,"I have a bulging disk, I have suffered from back pain for 4 years now. I occasionally split a 600mg pill. I notice little pain relief but I wake up happy. The strangest thing. I didn't realize the medication was used for anxiety, which is why I researched. I have had some depression associated with my back injury. I will take again a half of 600mg pill at night. It helps me sleep and I literally wake up happy. I should mention that I take it intermittently. I may take for a week straight but that is the longest.",0,58
Gabapentin,"I've  even taking gabapentin for three years. From the get-go I have felt the benefits of this medicine. I usually take 300mg morning and evening.  If I have a crowded situation, I sometimes use it at lunch time as well.  I have done well on this. I know that isn't for everyone.  But this is the medicine that has come along and freed me from anxiety. A true liberator with no dopey side effects.",10,122
Gabapentin,"Thank God for this medication! After a few major life changes I recently went through I developed an anxiety disorder on top of frequent panic attacks. After trying a few medicines my PCP put me on a Xanax regimen. BAD IDEA! Within 2 1/2 months I was up to 4-5mg/day! I got sick of it and went to a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner. After being appalled that I was prescribed that much Xanax she put me on a Gabapentin regimen. 100mg 3x's a day for one week, then 200mg 3x's a day for my second week. Then a follow up. I just started my second week and I'm already taking less than half of the Xanax I was needing. She said within a month I'll be off the Xanax. I feel great all day. I don't even feel like I need the Xanax.",9,113
Gabapentin,I am an addict in recovery and after a year of being clean I got a terrible anxiety disorder. Within two days I felt normal again this so far has helped a ton.,10,111
Gabapentin,I have taken many medications for anxiety and depression. This works just like Klonopin for me right now. It takes the weight off your chest and removes my mental anxiety and even some of my physical side effects. I'm currently on 300mg a day and it's enough to calm me down and take the edge off. Great medication.,8,108
Gabapentin,"I have recently started this medication. 300 mg twice a day. My doctor said she always prescribes it together with some type of antidepressant therefore I take it together with a very low doses of Prozac. That choice was due to my anxiety, which she said Prozac would be effective for that condition. Also, the Prozac should take a few weeks to notice the effect. The day I started the Neurontin, I could see an immediate change in my mood and my ability to asses a situation more clearly without being so overwhelmed. I am not diagnosed with bipolar so much as a general anxiety disorder. Also, I have frequent back and leg pains and I have not yet discovered if there is a significant difference in the amount of pain I experience.",0,64
Gabapentin,"This is my first day on Gapapentin for anxiety, and I have experienced truly amazing results!  I am free of anxiety and work, and excessive thinking has greatly diminished.  I am thinking clearly, and there are no apparent side affects.  I began to feel the calming effect with 20 minutes of so.  I hope that I will continue to receive this therapeutic effect on such a low dose, and do not build up a tolerance.",9,87
Gabapentin,"I was taking 300 mgs 3 x daily. The drunk, dizziness, overall sick feeling was just to much. Took for 3 weeks. The doc then lowered my dose to 100 2x a.m. and noon and 300 5 p.m. I was still getting that drunk feeling on it two weeks. Somewhat helped with anxiety but not like all the good reviews I'm reading. (I'm jealous) :)  developed severe rash and went to the doc and blood pressure was 170/92. I have always had great blood pressure. Doc said stop and stop now, call your psych. and let him know. Don't know what else to try. So may ssri's make me sick as I am allergic. Sucks, I know the anxiety and depression will be back soon and just don't know which way to turn???",1,31
Gabapentin,"I can't tolerate SSRI's.  I've tried them all.  This is the only medicine that works for me.  It takes care of my depression and my anxiety.  1800 mg/day I've heard that a new drug is being tested and will be available in 2016 that targets the glutamate in the brain.  People are getting significant relief with it in just a few days.  Until then, its Gabapentin.",10,66
Gabapentin,"After 20 years of every SSRIs for depression and generalized anxiety disorder I have found that Gabapentin is the only medicine that has really helped the anxiety with the exception of Thioridizane (now withdrawn in UK). At first Seroquel seemed to help but 3 months now on Gabapentin and significantly better. Still haven't found the ideal dose (now about 2400 a day) but initial side effects have worn off. My family say that since coming off Seroquel my personality has returned to what it used to be years ago. Give it a good try, and good luck. If you post on here I do think it helps if you mention dosage (and body weight 224lbs).",9,90
Gabapentin,I have been experiencing severe anxiety and depression as the result of a job loss and this medication has been amazing. I was unable to function until I began taking this medication.  It has truly been very helpful and has helped to lower my anxiety and depression.,9,118
Gabapentin,"I have struggled with social phobia, anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. 6 months ago my psychiatrist prescribed Neurontin and I can say that my life has completely changed. I feel like a new person, I feel no side effects and the best part is that it works immediately and can be taken when needed. For someone like me this is a miracle.",9,107
Gabapentin,"This is my miracle. I was put on it in Germany and had to go off it until I had insurance again. I suffer from depression and anxiety. Often I would find myself stuck in a daydream world because of all the things going on in my life, including my partner of years (15-25). I would have no energy and just feel so low. Finally I had insurance and was put on 1800mg a day. I feel so much better. I feel like I can handle life and set goals for myself. I don't feel anxiety. I don't sit here and think of the negative and focus on a positive life. I am more fun and interactive with my son.  It literately saved my life. I don't know why.",10,123
Gabapentin,"Started taking gabapentin about 18 months ago for depression and anxiety. Almost immediately my symptoms were alleviated. No side effects, and it still works. I take 3600 mg/day, split either in two or three doses. For an acute attack of anxiety I will take an additional 600 or 1200 mg as needed, and that will almost always do the trick. I agree with those that call this a miracle.",9,92
Gabapentin,On it for 5 days and feel like a different person. I'm actually happy for the 1st time in years! Take Celexa and trazodone also but call this my miracle pill. Just hope it keeps working.,10,69
Gabapentin,I've been taking gabapentin for a year for severe anxiety social anxiety and it has been wonderful. I'm a very worrisome person so when I take this medicine I feel more at ease without feeling sedated. I find it funny my Dr said they don't generally use this medicine for anxiety but it works for me and apparently a lot more people then she made it seem.,10,90
Gabapentin,"Almost no negative side effects, aside from strange and vivid dreams; although I enjoy them and they aren't nightmares. Gabapentin helps me stay at ease when I'm alone. My anxiety used to be bad, even when I was just sitting there but with this, it's gone. I take two 300mg pills each day. However, I still feel anxiety in social settings such as school but it makes life a lot easier, even though its not a 100% fix.",9,67
Gabapentin,"I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (Before my traumatic event, I was already an anxious person). Neurontin calms me like Klonopin, but helps me focus instead of sedating me. I take 300mg 4x a day, so it doesn't make me tired. It makes me very talkative, which is strange. I talk to random people sometimes, which is unlike me.",10,93

Gabapentin,"I have severe anxiety and have been taking Gabapentin for a week, gradually building up to 3 x 300mg a day. Within an hour of taking it I notice a heady, slightly drunk sensation and feel a little 'high', but this passes and I'm finding my thoughts are more organized, I have more energy and I can get more things done. Because I'm more active during the day, I am sleeping better and longer at night. My heart is no longer continually racing, and my chest pains have diminished. Another good thing is that these tablets do not make you feel desensitized, or like a zombie. All in all I would say these are definitely working for me.",8,186
Gabapentin,"I just started this medication yesterday. I am taking it for anxiety, insomnia, neuropathy .I was relying heavily on benzodiazapines to curb extreme, constant anxiety accompanied by constant low- level pain.

Gabapentin,"600 mg three times a day. I was taking Gabapentin for 3 years but I stopped it because it has too many side effects, including numbness on my whole body, weight gain is a major fact, more headache than usual, sleepy, tired, active but with a tingling sensation on my tongue and so on, depression when I didn't take it, intolerable, anxiety, sweats, withdrawal symptoms, but it does help with pain and many things but the consequences of it are horrible. Memory loss is another fact, definitely, is a very dangerous medication.",5,75
Gabapentin,"I was prescribed Gabapentin for herniated disks &amp; nerve damage, I'm amazed at how it's helped me with hot flashes &amp; mood swings.

Now I'm balanced mentally I don't overreact and I don't break out in a sweat the moment my head hits the pillow so I'm getting a good nights sleep, when I read it was used for seizures I was afraid to take it fearing it would cause me to have seizures but that hasn't happened and I've been taking it for 6 months, it's been a positive life changing experience for me and everyone else who knows me.

Gabapentin,Well to make the back story brief. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Was put on Neurontrin it worked so well. I managed to get off it for years but recently I was put on it with Ativan. I'm at 200 twice a day and 300mg at night. I still get physical symptoms so next week I will up to 300mg three times a day. It worked before so hoping it does again. I've not been working or going anywhere because of this bad relapse. I have to also wean off Ativan at same time and use only this for panic. I'll keep posted as how its working.,0,52
Gabapentin,"My psychiatrist started me on Gabapentin for anxiety almost a year ago and it's been a lifesaver. I had no idea how prevalent my anxiety had become until the Gabapentin somehow calmed it down. The constant bouncing of my legs, the tapping of my fingers, the repetitive rhythmic stuff going on in my head and body and the crippling anxiety all just calmed down or went away. I started at 100mg 3x a day and have now settled into a very comfortable 300mg 3x a day. A little drowsiness at first but my body has adjusted and now I feel no side-effects at all. When I wake up in the morning and the Gabapentin is out of my system I'm immediately aware of the anxiety again but it quickly goes away once I take my morning dose.",10,143
Gabapentin,"I have generalized anxiety disorder and Panic Disorder going on ten years now. I've been on Zoloft the entire time. I had a bad relapse of symptoms this year while on Zoloft. I bumped it up to 200 mg and began taking Gabapentin 300mg/day. I've been doing better, but I'm still working on getting my confidence up after this recent relapse.  Last week I started having anxiety symptoms for a couple of days, so I bumped the Gabapentin to 600mg/day. My anxiety is now better so far. I've noticed a side effect on this dose that I didn't get on the 300 mg... I've had spells of depression the past few days. I think those will pass as my body becomes used to the new dose. Depression is listed as a possible side effect. I just hope this medicine doesn't poop out on me.",8,44
Gabapentin,"After decades of battling post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, I finally have found a medication that helps to calm the revved feeling I constantly battle.  It is not complete gone, but I feel as if I can breathe again.  The tightness in my chest has reduced and my upper back no longer hurts because I can relax my shoulders.  It is as if someone has loosened their grip on a rubber band!  Best of all, self-help techniques, like relaxation, now work!!

Gabapentin,"I have very bad post traumatic stress disorder with severe anxiety. As for a back story for the medicines I've tried: all SSRIs, two MAOIs, and one tricyclic antidepressants to try to calm the anxiety and bad dreams, all did nothing but either make me a zombie or made me suicidal with severe panic attacks.  Now on to benzodiazepines:  Xanax, Kolonopin, and Valium, the first and last were not strong enough for me and being a 5'6 and 110lb woman, I could not get an increase in dosage because I was too small for that.  I was also on Buspar which did nothing but make me have fits of rage and very severe panic attacks.

I did not even tell my doctor about my anxiety since I was used to dealing with it for years on my own. After only a few doses, my headaches were controlled and even better my anxiety was gone! I felt better than I have in years and had control of my life again! I only take a few doses around my menstrual cycle because that's when the worst headaches occur. I will still feel anxiety in certain situations but not in every day life. I'm not a big fan of any pills but I signed up for this site to share my experience with this medicine and hope it works for others as well!",10,98
Gabapentin,Gabapentin has been a God send for me. I have taken several of the benzos for my anxiety and I have a very negative opinion of them. Gabapentin removes my anxiety and allows me to be completely alert and focused at work. It allows me to be friendly and outgoing but at the same time calm. I have tons of energy everyday and sleep really well at night. I started taking gabapentin for nerve damage in my left arm about 2 years ago. Immediately I noticed it to be an extremely effective medication for worry and anxiety. I believe it to be a perfect medication for me. I never want to stop taking it. Makes me feel normal.,10,159
Gabapentin,"<b>Neurontin (gabapentin):</b>			 Neurontin has changed my life dramatically. I suffered from high anxiety with panic and anxiety attacks. I started this medicine at about 19 and had been off and on it the past 13 years. It literally has made me a new person. When I don't use it I notice a lot of fatigue, worry, anxiety, etc. When I am using this medication, I can concentrate on the better side of things and am not so negative. In the beginning it did have some side effects such as a loopy feeling. Over time that did pass, and now gives me energy to get through the day. I am on 300mg 3 x day. I can also sleep much easier, and my carpal tunnel syndrome is dramatically better. Before I felt very snappy and impatient, now I handle things with a much more calm disposition. Love it.",0,530
Gabapentin,"I call this the miracle pill. Have been treated for depression/anxiety for many years, when a unexpected major life event occurred.  I didn't sleep for more than an hour or two for nearly 8 weeks before finally deciding I needed additional medical help. After getting gabapentin and taking it for one day, I felt so much better, less tense, my insides were not knotted up and I slept all night the very next day.  With no lingering side effects the next day.",0,70
Gabapentin,"My life has been very difficult to say the least. I was severely abused as a child, have borderline, a mood disorder, became an addict and alcoholic (clean now for 3.5 year), have insomnia and have issues with codependency and in general have an overactive and negative thinking pattern. Since 2005 I have been on and off numerous medicines and in therapy. I went on gabapentin a little over a month ago. It has controlled my anxiety wonderfully so far. I take 600 mg of Seroquel to sleep and Effexor at 150 mg for my depression. The Seroquel works wonders with sleep but the Effexor isn't too good. Gabapentin has allowed me to do things I could only dream about and is a wonderful addition to my regime of spirituality, exercise, AA and work. It calms me.",9,94
Gabapentin,"<b>Neurontin (gabapentin):</b>			 I guess it helps with the anxiety. It affects my memory horribly, I can't think of simple words, I miss exits on the freeway, I forget where I am going, etc. It makes me nauseous and gives me diarrhea.  Just when I am starting to feel better, it is time to take it again.  I take 100mg 3 times a day.  I have only been on it a couple of weeks, so I keep hoping the side effects will go away.  I still get anxious when I am faced with my main stressor, but it is not as severe (not the full blown panic attack), just the pain in my stomach, choking in my throat, feeling like my heart is pounding in my head, chest, etc., so it does help some.",0,132
Gabapentin,"I was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. My doctor put me on Gabapentin @ 2700mg/day I started with 300 mg/day and worked my way up. I feel good! I never felt this good all my life, I have opened up to the world around me and enjoying life much better. I deal with stress and fear in a totally different way. I'm mostly happy all day haha!",9,80
Gabapentin,"<b>Neurontin (gabapentin):</b>			 I way prescribed 300 mg Neurontin for anxiety and it has been amazing. I'm also on a number of other anti-anxiety drugs, however Neurontin is helping to lessen my anxiety with its sedative effects. I highly recommend trying Neurontin. I tried Lyrica before Neurontin and Neurontin is more effective and cheaper for me. 8/10!",0,151
Gabapentin,"Gabapentin has relatively few side effects - I can be a little dizzy - not much, plus it makes my eyes a little puffy. But it does take the edge off anxiety and can be taken as need, unlike so many other medicines. I take 600mg twice a day.",8,31
Gabapentin,"I suffered with severe migraines several times a year.  In my 30s, the migraines became more frequent, longer lasting, more severe. Accidentally discovered Xanax, lifted the migraine immediately. Xanax not being a long-term solution for many reasons, my neurologist prescribed gabapentin.  I haven't had a migraine in over six years.  I take 1200 mg a day, usually before bed, but have discovered that taking 300mg in the afternoon when anxiety kicks in and the rest at night has made a huge difference in anxiety.  Anxiety runs in my family, migraines, too, and this medication works very well for me.",10,67
Gabapentin,"<b>Neurontin (gabapentin):</b>			 Made me very agitated for the first few days. Had lingering side effects on the dose I am on. Often times makes me lightheaded, drunk feeling, high feeling, and gives me blurred vision, HOWEVER, it controls my panic disorder. I am on 600mg 3 times per day, using Klonopin as well to control anxiety. It makes my body physically unable to panic, which quells the anxiety.",0,69
Gabapentin,I could not believe how wonderful I felt after taking this medicine. No more anxiety or restless legs. It is great. I even sleep better.,9,66
Gabapentin,"<b>Neurontin (gabapentin):</b>			 This has been a God send for my generalized anxiety. After being a heavy marijuana user, I was left with near-crippling amounts of anxiety in my daily life. Neurontin controls it very well and gave me my life back. I do still get panic attacks, but I use a benzodiazepine for those and it's been pretty good.",0,73
Gabapentin,"I have been dealing with anxiety, depression and was diagnosed as bipolar. I have been on Remeron at night to help me sleep and 1 mg or Klonopins 3 times a day. While that did help my depression, my panic attacks and anxiety still were horrible where I ruined a relationship just a day before I started the gabapentin. Now that I have taken this 3 times a day at 300 mg I have been able to rationalize and reason much better. I do notice I am a little dizzy at times but nothing horrible. If I only had this medication earlier I may not have lost my partner due to my actions.",9,61
Gabapentin,I love this medicine. I used to get incredibly anxious at night - NOTHING could help me. My doctor prescribed this and the FIRST night I felt better. My mind was not cycling through scary thoughts that used to plague me. I was able to rationalize much easier. I'm just so glad to finally have something that helps.,10,72
Gabapentin,"I was having terrible issue with anxiety which was resulting in severe and unrelenting headaches. Added to the fact that I am pre-menopausal, I had not felt like myself in at least a year.  I went to the psychiatrist who continued my Celexa and started me on a very small dose of Neurontin at 100 mg 3 times daily.  I am only taking it twice daily to avoid the foggy feeling.  It has only been 3 days and I can honestly say, I feel like a new person... or should I say, the person I used to be.  I was skeptical that Neurontin could do so much to relieve my anxiety, but it works for me, and my headache and constant neck tension/pain is gone.  I am so glad my psychiatrist realizes the benefits of this medication and that she prescribed it for me.",9,76
Gabapentin,"I have been taking gabapentin for about a week now and it has literally saved my life!  I was having such incredible nervous energy that was affecting my sleep, relationships, daily routine, etc. I was having a meltdown everyday with lots of physical pain (mostly stomach).  This medicine calmed everything down and is helping me feel normal again!  Thanks to a good doctor...this really worked well. Can't say enough good things. I smiled this morning when I woke up for the first time in years!",10,129
Gabapentin,I've been taking Gabapentin for three years to relieve my anxiety symptoms; 1800mg twice daily. Although I started at a much smaller dose in the beginning and did feel groggy at times my body is now completely accustomed to it. This is the only medication I have tried that allows me to function normally on a daily basis without feeling side effects. I highly recommend it to patients with GAD who don't respond to other medications.,10,57
Gabapentin,"I was prescribed gabapentin when I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It was for my panic attacks and anxiety. I went crazy with it the first couple of weeks taking way more than prescribed but that was the only way it worked for me. My doctor then upped my dose when I told him about it. He just started me off with the small dose to see how my body reacts to it. I love this medicine! Not to the point of addiction but because it calms me down and makes me think clearer whenever I freak out. There are no side effects at all for me. No dizziness, no grogginess no sleepiness. I function normally, I can even drive and work and study. It has helped me a lot. The dose that works best for me is 1500mg, I don't take it everyday anymore, just as needed.",9,54
Gabapentin,"Gabapentin is the most liberating medicine I have ever used. I have tried Effexor, Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Lamictal, Lithium, Phenibut, Kava, Theanine, -anything with implications of anxiolytic properties. Finding the right dosage can be a little tricky, but when that is tuned, this medication seems superior to any anxiety medication available.  Side effects of too much- dizziness, fatigue.",10,69
Gabapentin,<b>Neurontin (gabapentin):</b>			 I have had anxiety disorder with some symptoms of OCD for most of my life. This medicine works wonders. I feel so much more calmer with it. I feel a little slow after taking it but when you have high anxiety your slow may be the average persons normal. It is certainly worth a shot. I am a 250lb man and I only take 300mg with great results. Never tried a higher dosage yet.,0,107
Gabapentin,"I love this medicine. I have moderate anxiety and sleeping problems. I get the 100 mg tablets and take a couple if I'm feeling anxious during the day and up it at night if I can't sleep. I love the ability to determine how many mg's I am taking and since I weigh only 100lbs, most prescriptions do make me sick. I highly recommend this medicine. It has not made me feel drowsy or foggy at all. It simply calms everything down.",9,63
Gabapentin,"<b>Neurontin (gabapentin):</b>			 I have had general anxiety most of my life, and occasional panic attacks. About a month ago, some personal issues tossed me into a week-long panic attack, I fell into a deep depression that made me have horrible physical pain. I started Neurontin 4 days ago and hours later, I was able to get up and move around, the panic attack stopped and I could feel it lifting.  I'm still down' but I have things to be genuinely sad about.  Today I am starting trazodone to help with sleep,  I dont get drowsy on Neurontin.  But for me, it worked immediately for the massive anxiety with no side effects except a foggy feeling which I no longer have with doses. The myalgia and pain from the depression is also nearly gone. I'm thrilled.",0,103
Gabapentin,My anxiety level was very high and a little stress and I was in panic mode.  I started gabapentin increasing the dose and time to the level where my anxiety was at a tolerable level.  My dose is 800mg every five hours.  I would recommend anyone who suffers from anxiety that is not managed by any of the other anti-anxiety medicines to try it.  I really came into taking this medication not believing it would work....IT DID. I can't tell you how awesome it feels to be able to tolerate the anxiety for once in my life.,0,87
Gabapentin,"<b>Neurontin (gabapentin):</b>			 My husband is on a light dose of Neurontin (Gabepentin) and the medicine really works to relieve his anxiety.  He has Parkinson's Disease and mild cognitive disorder, as well as Parkinson's depression.  Neurontin works well on his tremor and his anxiety, but higher doses make him foggy.  His dosage is 800mg spread over 12-16 hours, with the option to increase the dose to 1000mg per day, depending on his anxiety level.  He has been on Neurontin for many years and it continues to work well for him.",0,83
Gabapentin,"<b>Neurontin (gabapentin):</b>			 I'm not really sure if its helped much, but maybe made some impact?  I don't like that I have to take it twice a day, because everything else I take is once at night, so I always forget my morning dosage.  600mg twice daily.",0,15
Gabapentin,"<b>Neurontin (gabapentin):</b>			 I have pretty severe PTSD with some generalized free-floating anxiety.  When the Klonopin just wasn't cutting it anymore, and I'd tried so many other drugs (Atarax, Remeron, Buspar....) with no relief, I finally convinced my doctor to let me give Gabapentin a try.  I also have chronic pain symptoms, so I thought that there was a chance it would help with that (it only helped a little), but literally, with my first dose I felt like a ton of weight had been lifted from my shoulders.  I was happy and not anxious.  Unfortunately, it petered out on me over a few months.  I taper off and after a few months get back on.  Still works!",0,115
Gabapentin,I love this medication. It got me feeling the best I have in a long time. I don't feel so on the edge everyday. I take 600 mg a day. It has done good by me.,9,63

Gabapentin,"I have just started taking Gabapentin and it has been very effective in leveling me out so I can better handle daily life stress and crisis. It doesn't seem to have any conflicts with several other medicines I take. It may make you drowsy, but I'm very impressed with the results so far. I take three 300 MG capsules per day. I'm very glad my doctor prescribed this drug.",9,85

Gabapentin,"I was only taking 600mg (2 x 300mg) an hour before bed. I overslept every day while taking this medication. I also felt groggy in the morning, stumbling to bathroom when I first wake up. Did not really help with anxiety or my mood.",1,35
Gabapentin,Although this medicine is not approved and is used off label for anxiety it has helped me a lot. I have been on it for 3 weeks and when I don't take it I can tell. I have tried Vistoril and had not luck with that so my doctor had me try this.  I would highly recommend this medicine.,9,66
BuSpar,"I didn't read all the reviews but I was surprised to see people with intense reactions to BuSpar, maybe they took higher doses than I did.  I've taken this drug on and off for a few years and it kind of works - it's hard to explain. I have taken probably 15-20 anxiety and depression meds in the last 10 years and many have bad side effects, buspar had none of those other than drowsiness - the only reason I keep buspar around is that it is very mild in my book - the effect is mild but the side effects are also mild or nonexistent",7,15
BuSpar,"Do not take this drug. Had a horrible experience. Nightmares, intrusive thoughts, mood swings, apathy, angry, made me the opposite of who I am. Withdrawals are even worse so much buzzing and brain zaps. I would have rather had the anxiety/panic attacks! Still dealing with all the bizzare effects. This is coming from someone who never was on any medication. Have to take other meds just to sleep and make it through my day now. Hoping to be back to normal soon. Thank goodness for the ER staff who helped me!",1,11
BuSpar,"I took Buspar for two days. On the first day my sleep was not deep and a I had weird dreams. On the second day I had a massive panic attack after my third dose of 5mg, and was unable to sleep at all that night. It was a horrendous experience. It is an awful drug for me.",1,9
BuSpar,"Im an Iraq Veteran who has been diagnosed with PTSD and chronic anxiety. When I first started taking the buspar it would generate some level of anxiety for me because its a new chemical being introduced into my body. I would fight through the anxiety and keep taking the pills. After about a week I no longer had to fight the anxiety that was generated by taking buspar. I started off at 5mg and now Im up to 30mg a day. Ive been taking it for about 4-5 months now and have seen great progress. I know the list of  potential  side effects can generate anxiety for you by just reading them. However, the only  side effects  I noticed was a little weight gain and an increase in my sex drive.( which isnt bad for me and my spouse). I would recommend buspar to anyone. Its one of those drugs that it will either work for you, or not.",9,34
BuSpar,"I took Buspar for about 3 and a half months, and noticed very mild effects if any at all. I suffer from severe anxiety, and panic attacks. After taking Buspar I can honestly say, it doesn't do much.",4,47
BuSpar,"I took Buspirone when I had a back surgery and my father was sick from cancer, it was a very stressful time. I was in a panic. It helped me immediately (though I know it is supposed to take a few weeks). I remained on it for a few months as I dealt with the trauma of losing a parent. Then tapered off and went on about my business for a year. Ive returned to the psych because I have regular anxiety and mild depression, he prescribed lexipro, I took that for 4 days and got increased anxiety and diarrhea, I decided to try to go back on the buspirone because I know that worked for me in the past. Heres hoping it works again!",10,46
BuSpar,"I wouldnt say this medicine is horrible but it didnt help me. I feel like this is for people with very mild anxiety. My anxiety is very high so it only helped a little. Made me dizzy, and gave me a headache I tried it for 8 days and stopped. Im now on Zoloft 25mg and really liking it so far.",3,17
BuSpar,"I just wanted to say how UPSET I am that so many doctors are afraid to prescribe benzodiazepines for anxiety relief. They are putting us on meds such as Seroquel, and others that are NOT designed to treat anxiety. Buspar, like other SSRIs and SSDNRIs, are not effective to treat attacks of anxiety. Its out of hand how too many docs are not prescribing REAL anxiolytics.  Buspar did not help me. I only want a PRN dose not a maintenance med.",1,120
BuSpar,"Buspar from what I read is for anxiety directly related to over thinking. This is what causes my anxiety. Its chronic. Ive read reviews that it doesnt work, but maybe other people get anxiety from triggers. I just constantly over think everything to the point I avoid certain situations because I fear the outcome. This drug has allowed me to overcome this and talk about issues I have with someone, resolve issues faster, be more productive, etc. its drastically changed my life. Friends say Im more cordial. Basically makes you feel very calm and more carefree and to stop thinking 24/7 about silly things",10,198
BuSpar,"Buspar should be classified as a hallucinogenic drug! I took it for one day (15mg.) with Zoloft to get off Ativan.  It made me lightheaded, nauseas, nervous, speedy, and when I tried to sleep I saw terrible images moving around in my head- I couldnt sleep at all! These awful hallucinations gave me panic attacks- I was so scared!  I also had some uncontrolled jerky movements of my limbs when lying down! I called the nurse line for help because I could not reach my psychiatrist! This experience was a nightmare! I also read an FDA report that stated that Buspar can cause Tardive Dyskinesia- uncontrolled involuntary jerking movements of face and body. Who wants that?  Do not take it!",1,41
BuSpar,"Buspar DOES help with anxiety, but it you have another comorbid illness like depression, it might feel like it is not helping on that area. I was on this medication for a few months and my anxiety felt really better, but my depression was still bugging me a lot so I was switched to Zoloft. Buspar helped me with the palpitations and chest pain related to anxiety, I felt like I could think better and even breathe better. It was a great medication. The only downside to it is that you can get headaches or brain zaps if you forget a dose, so put an alarm on your phone!",9,40
BuSpar,"Have been taking Buspar 15mg 3 times a day for 3 months and didn't notice anything therapeutic at all, going to the doctor's tomorrow might ask for the max of 20mgs 3 times a day. Not sure if it is a  very ineffective med, or whether I would go as far and say it's a rubbish med",3,23
BuSpar,I have had emetophobia since I can remember (the fear of vomit). For the past couple months I have been dealing with horrible stomach problems and nasty anxiety attacks. When I went to the doctor they suggested I take Zoloft for the anxiety. Zoloft was the first SSRI I tried and the first night I tried it I felt extremely sick. I went to the doctor again and they put me on prozac. I took that the first day and felt okay. The second day I took it I couldnt even get out of bed. I was super nervous to try anything else (especially SSRIs). So my doctor prescribed me BusPar. It is not an SSRI and doesnt have as bad side affects. Im taking this pill 2xs a day and I started taking last night and am now on the third dose. I havent felt sick at all and I hope it stays that way!! But so far so good!,8,44
BuSpar,"I have been taking this medicine BuSpar for about 8 months. Because I also suffer from Bipolar I disorder I also take Lamictal, Provigil, and Seroquel. I take the Buspar three times a day and it took about a month to kick in. I've been on several of the benzodiazepine group before for anxiety (Valium, Xanax, Ativan) and the only advantage to those is that you can take as needed for anxiety and they work quickly. They are also highly addictive. Buspar is not addictive but must be taken regularly--not just for an anxiety attack. It doesn't work for an immediate attack. But if you take it regularly three times a day you won't have anxiety and you won't need the benzos. I think it is wonderful!",9,64
BuSpar,My 17 year old daughter was put on this Buspar a month ago it heightened her anxiety it made her have angry outbursts. Her entire demeanor has changed she isnt my daughter on this med. Needless to say the doctor disagreed with me but I took her off it last night . This med is horrible !!!,0,36

BuSpar,"For the first month it had no effect but after that, the results have been more than satisfactory. Before being prescribed Buspar, I was prescribed only Klonopin while was effective it had worse side effects.

BuSpar,I take Buspirone for GAD. I'm bipolar type 2 also. Buspirone doesn't have any effect on me separately. But I augument  it by venlafaxine after 2 weeks it has an affect,7,17
BuSpar,In my experience the only think that works for anxiety is Benzodiazepines. I don't like how doctors are so quick to throw all sorts of different psychotic medications at patients when for the most part they don't really work. Just because something isn't a narcotic doesn't mean it should be overprescribed and just because Benzodiazepines are narcotics doesn't mean they shouldn't be prescribed.,0,118

BuSpar,I was on this medication for about 6 months. It made my heart race and worsened my anxiety.,1,38
BuSpar,"Doctor prescribed this Buspar to me for my anxiety I got which worsened with Wellbutrin XL (I take that for depression). I used to take Xanax but decided to discontinue the use of it. My doctor prescribed me this and told me to take it when needed or everyday which ever I prefer. I have zero complaints about this medication. When I first took it, I got super dizzy and light headed. But other than that it does calm me and make me feel much better.",0,46
BuSpar,Buspar is supposed to take a month to work give or take. I've been on 10mg dose 2 x day for 7 weeks and I'm MORE anxious now. Ugh.,3,46
BuSpar,Out of the few meds I have tried Busapr has been helping me tremendously! I have initially started out on paxil then tried all three different doses of zoloft. I also had hydroxyzine added into the mix to slow down my panic attacks. My doctors were more worried about treating my depression more than anything. The anxiety was so crippling I was  literally having panic attacks almost every day and sometimes more than once a day. I finally had enough and told my doctor to take me off of the SSRI drugs(I honestly don't think that class of drugs agreed with my body anyway) and treat just my anxiety.  So far the results are amazing. I am now on 10mg twice a day and feel  a lot better. Yeah I may have some of the random side effects that come with the meds but in my case the benefits outweigh the risks.,8,76
BuSpar,"The people who have been on this, are you on a separate medication for depression while on buspar? If not I can see how many feel no use from it.",0,21
BuSpar,I have not taken Buspar seriously for the past few years. I thought probably is enough. Now I have been taking it and I feel a difference. I feel like getting a new life. I am not worrying about problems rather focusing on solving them with planning. It a great med.,8,62
BuSpar,"I took this med Buspar for 2 weeks. My anxiety skyrocketed, could not sleep more than 3 hours.  Felt zombie like.  Developed a fast heart rate and upset stomach.   After about 7-9 days did calm down a bit. I went off too many  bad side effects for me On my second day of withdrawal body aches. My dose of Buspar was  5mg 2x a day",2,34

BuSpar,"Back in the early 90's I had been going through a few years of being a hypochondriac.  I had had a severe depression, and just when I was starting to feel good, my mother was diagnosed with lung cancer and only lived about 4 more months. A year or so later I started to feel bumps and lumps and all sorts of things..driving to my doctors, walk-in clinics and hospitals over and over again...just to find out I was ok and this circle went on and off from 1988 - 1991.  Thank goodness my doctor gave me a script for buspar.  I don't remember what dose I was on.  It wasn't a high dose.  But 3 weeks after taking it I literally woke up one day feeling really good and realising I didn't have to fear being sick the way I had been.  Like night and day.  I have never been on an antidepressant or any similar drug that had such a major and wonderful effect.  I didn't feel high or not myself, just the opposite.  Please try it if you have crippling anxiety!",10,88

Stiffness of the legs...excruciating pain and could barely walk. I had pain...weakness in the hands and feet. The pain in my hands was almost unbearable! I saw my PCP 4 days later. Still in horrible pain she told me to go back to the 20mg; my body was craving it. I felt relief and within 2 weeks I was fine. I'm still on 20mg. I now have had depression for a few weeks. I'm continuing buspar so I can get a sleep med due to 40 years of insomnia.",5,16
BuSpar,"My new dr wouldn't prescribe my usual combo of Prozac with Xanax as needed.  I was mad but gave the buspar for anxiety a try and it works out to be  BEST COMBO EVER!! I actually felt euphoria and a bit light headed the first few days. Then in the first few months when I had had alcohol in addition to wine one night, I got EXTREMELY SICK. But as a social drinker  decided to try again lol but only with wine. Everything has been fine since. I can even have margaritas etc again. (But I can't stress enough how scary and extreme that sickness was in the beginning, so drinkers BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL.) My family says they have never seen me so happy in all my 46 yrs. I am sure that I've never had such an easy going attitude. Things I used to take personally have no effect on me now.  I take two 5mg tabs at night before bed. This works for me even though it isn't what is recommended (I.e.2 or 3x daily doses) No more obsessive worries, thin skin reactions or depression!!",10,65

BuSpar,"It's an excuse drug for doctor's to write because,  because the drugs that actually work are controlled substances. Buspar does very little for anxiety and, depression. I feel you are better off smoking or drinking to calm you down. Thanks to government regulations everyone has to suffer.",2,87
BuSpar,I was prescribed 5mg buspirone 3 times a day for anxiety. I understood that the medication would take up to a month to start having an effect. This is due to the need for buspirone to build up in your brain's receptors. I had a great improvement with my overall generalized anxiety after about 3 weeks. This is not a medication that will give you a high effect.  Sure everyone's chemical makeup is different but this is not the reason you see so many negative reviews about buspirone.,10,36
BuSpar,"Horrible!  Was almost working and then boom!   Hyped up my anxiety and ocd, worry and panic.   My doctor said to stay with it a few more weeks.  Started to get depressed and very sad.  Beware!  It might work for some, but for the ones it doesn't, it is a dangerous drug!",1,35
BuSpar,Taking Buspar at a dose of 10mgs 3 times a day  for anxiety does very little. It's a substitute to shut you up because your doctor's hands are tied to right prescriptions that work. Like Xanax and Valium.,4,46
BuSpar,Genetic testing for the correct medication is essential in 2019!  Finding the medications to avoid saves so much time and distress. Buspar is the right medication for me genetically and I am experiencing positive results.,9,56
BuSpar,"Nope! I was prescribed Buspar 15 mg  at a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day. A nightmare for sure. After the first few initial days and it getting in my system that nightmare began! Side effects of not sleeping over 3-4 hours a night. Shaking inside and out, dizzy and faint, full blown panic attacks, pacing the floor and body having to keep moving to stop that feeling of jumping out of my skin  (Akathisia)!! Tried Buspar for 3 weeks and gained 9 lbs and more ANXIETY than before.",1,28
BuSpar,"Been on it for two weeks now. Felt benefits on day 2.  I started with 5mg/2x day. At first, my insomnia got much worse but I stuck with buspar with the occasional assistance of ambien and melatonin (not on same night of course). Now I am sleeping through most of the night without sleep aids or waking up with that nervous feeling in my stomach. I am now motivated to do things again too. I'm really sensitive to drugs but I did up my intake to 7.5mg/2x day. My history of taking drugs with serotonin has been so-so, so I'm not over the top excited about this drug, but I am definitely able to function and my relationships are way better!",8,43
BuSpar,Been on 10mg Buspar twice daily for 2 days. I have already experienced terrible insomnia on both nights. First night I  was able to get 4 hours of broken sleep. Second night did not sleep one wink. Experienced panic attack last night along with increased heart rate and racing thoughts. The thought of continuing on with this drug is unbearable.,1,23
BuSpar,"Dr added this medication BuSpar and  5 weeks later I feel very little improvement. I will feel somewhat for a short 30 minutes ok, then bam, starts all over again. The side effects are the physical symptoms of anxiety. Who thought, oh, this is a great medication.",0,14
BuSpar,"Was hesitant to take this pill after reading all the reviews and then finally decided to give it a try. HUGE mistake. My mind felt like it was getting electrocuted. I felt dizzy, light headed, and it was extremely unpleasant. I called my doctor immediately! I ended up forcing myself to take a nap and when I woke up, thankfully they had subsided. Its been about an hour since I awoke and I feel extremely tired and exhausted! I do not recommend this if your are highly sensitive to medication!",1,23
BuSpar,"I was on Buspar for 7 weeks. The first week was foggy, sleepy, high, sluggish, and no appetite. Then the two three week point I felt great. Until after the 4th week mark? My sleeping schedule was bad. I had arm tingles, face spasms, no appetite, not drinking a lot of water. By the 4th week I was a mess. I have never had such really dark thoughts before but on this drug for two weeks I was scared to even be alone because I didnt know what I was capable of. I wanted to live but my mind would tell me different.  I had high hopes but reading these reviews I'm glad Im not alone. I just got off of it cold turkey, 6 weeks and 4 days. Ill be back to update about how I feel being off. I hope this helps anyone. I felt alone and scared but if you feel this isnt for you dont hesitate to stop! God bless!",3,41
BuSpar,I was weaned off clonazapam which I took for many years. Buspirone is utterly useless. Prescribed to placate patients who require benzos to live a normal life. It has the effectiveness of a placebo.,1,35
BuSpar,Tried many different anti-depressants over several years and none of them worked. A new doctor prescribed Buspar and Im so thankful! Works really well. I feel like a different person with a lot less anxiety bogging me down. I have been taking it for 2 weeks. My only negative is that I was originally prescribed 10mg twice a day and at around 3PM everyday I felt drained. I told my dr and she added a dose in the afternoon. It has a short half life so As a result you do feel it wear off. It has been a miraculous change! Im very pleased!,10,37
BuSpar,"BuSpar did nothing more than placebo for me. If it did anything for me, it may have calmed my nerves during a panic attack once. My GAD might be too severe for this medication and this may be a good starter medication for someone who is just starting with a doctor and is unsure how severe of a medication they need. For me, this is not an option and should not be taken daily, as it does even less. When taken As Needed the placebo affect was quite effective.",2,15
BuSpar,The first week and a half my anxiety was up and I was irritable but after two weeks I could really tell a difference in my anxiety. I can tell when it starts to wear off but Im on a very low dose. I will probably talk to my Dr. about upping the dosage soon.,9,15
BuSpar,"I tried Buspar, it helped with obsessive thoughts but it didn't help with depression. My doctor didn't want to prescribe an antidepressant and I felt lousy. Plus it increased my blood pressure. Not good!",6,13
BuSpar,This medicine is very good for long time control for GAD. I also take 900mg of gabapentin with the 30mg buspar daily. New laws and good reason forbids benzos long term I still take 2mg of xanax during panic attacks which after months on buspar they are very rare. Give it a try its a funny meds 30mg your fully up and 30mg later tired but a good relaxing kind takes awhile for it to help tho.   My advice if you have anxiety  is get off benzo's they will ultimately ruin your life and brain,8,47
BuSpar,"Buspar is the worst drug I have ever taken. It was prescribed several years ago for anxiety to cope with an upcoming surgery- and health risks associated with it. Prior to Buspar, I had never taken any depression medicine nor struggled with extreme anxiety. And I exercised often and was not taking medicine for any other health issue. Buspar sent me into a horrible, deep pit of despair, unlike I had ever known, or could even imagine anyone having. The doctor kept telling me it would take awhile to work, but after two weeks, Buspar never did. I got off of it and, while still anxious about surgery, had no more extreme depression. The despair, caused by Buspar was far worse than the surgery. If I had to choose, I would gladly have that surgery again rather than take another round of Buspar. Seriously, be careful with this drug.",1,40
BuSpar,Did not work for me.,2,12
BuSpar,"I always have a lot of anxiety, &amp; was optimistic about buspar. Lately I've been taking 10mg 4 times/day (as well as ativan &amp; seroquel to help the insomnia), &amp; I feel depressed &amp; no less anxious. Last night I dreamt that one of my cats fainted. I'll be talking with my doc about getting me off this. I feel no benefit whatsoever.",3,16
BuSpar,"Was misdiagnosed for months and took several prescriptions for another diagnosis. Symptoms worsened and felt like I was in a hole I couldnt scratch out of. Was taken off all meds, started on Buspar 10mg 3x a day and have never felt better. Its like being born again. Would recommend for anyone needing a quick fix. Be compliant and see what all it can do for you.",10,53
BuSpar,"I wish I had realized how individual all of these meds are to our bodies (work great for some, horribly for others). I started buspirone and soon was dealing with really dark horrible thoughts, extreme anxiety, etc. The mental/emotional reactions were nearly unbearable for me. Will it be the same for everyone? Obviously not. However, I realized after starting this med that it pays to take a minute to think through med changes before just jumping on board when a medical professional suggests something....even with the hopes of feeling a little bit better.",1,39
BuSpar,"For me BuSpar works pretty well on the physical symptoms of anxiety. What I mean is that unlike the SSRI that worked for me in the past, I still have the thoughts that cause the anxiety (the SSRI seemed to squash any negative thoughts), but at least my heart isn't racing, I don't have that deep sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, and I'm not sweating like crazy. I do feel pretty lazy and tired on it though. Better than getting hooked on a benzo and at least  I can get some sleep. It is has minimal side effects on me, which is what we expected with my Genesight results.",0,39
BuSpar,"My doctor give me this medicine, Buspar for anxiety.  I have very bad side affects heavy headache, my necks hurts, my mouth and throat is sooo dry and I am starting to coughing, very dizzy, I have horrible experience.",1,34
BuSpar,Does not work at all,1,22
BuSpar,"Buspar was an absolute Godsend! The only side effect I noticed right away was insomnia, but then I just combined my dose, and took it all in the morning as soon as waking up. ZERO side effects after that, and anxiety immediately went away - from the first day on!  Only problem - as the weeks and months went on, I began to notice something ... my appetite was out of control. I was CONSTANTLY hungry! This was not ok with me!  I knew it had to be the Buspar, as I had changed nothing else in my life.  So, after 3.5 months on, I had to make a decision - do I stay constantly hungry and have little to no anxiety, along with weight gain, or do I go off and deal with anxiety again??  I decided to go off. I quit cold turkey. ZERO withdrawal symptoms!! Has my anxiety returned?  Maybe ever so slightly... increased appetite and weight gain are not listed as possible side effects, but Im noticing with a lot of people it seems to be very common!",8,36
BuSpar,"I have used buspar, on and off for 8 or more years. I take 15mgs per day and it works for me. I would describe it action as mildly sedative. I still take ativan if things go south. Side effects are slight weight gain ,occassional headaches and some eye twitching.",7,29
BuSpar,"It just doesn't work for me. I don't really have any negative side effects anymore. For the first few weeks I would wake up several times during the night, and I would have extremely vivid dreams, but that went away. However for my Generalised Anxiety Disorder which is quite extreme, I have had no luck. Now that those initial side effects have gone away I feel like I'm not even taking any medication, no sides, no positive effects, nothing, just an empty pill.  12 weeks on it. Started at 15mg a day, worked up to 30mg a day.",3,27
BuSpar,"The side effects of BuSpar for me were worse sleep, anger, weight gain and tiredness. My anxiety got worse, I had an erratic heart beat, it made my eyes feel really weird. This drug made me completely dysfunctional, exhausted, nauseous and also  out of it. So distracted and it make my ADD worse .",1,36
BuSpar,"I've taken Buspar (45mg daily, 3X a day) for several years. I have GAD with infrequent panic attacks and a mild depression. I was originally prescribed Clonazepam, and took it for several years, but a new doc convinced me to get off the benzos, which I managed to do and was no small feat. The Buspar has been an absolute Godsend for me. The Clonozepam worked, but pretty much flatlined my personality. The Buspar made me feel normal for the first time in years...my wife comments that she didn't hear me laugh once on the Clonozepam, and now I enjoy life and laugh  all the time. Everyone is different, but this is a great drug for me!",9,87
BuSpar,"I was given buspar for anxiety. I started taking 5 mg once a day then I eventually tried to go up to 10 mg a day. NEVER AGAIN. I dont think it did anything for my anxiety except make it worse. Every time I took the pill, I felt super sedated and I would fall asleep and then have nightmares. I took it for almost 3 weeks hoping side effects would pass but it only got worse. Light headed, dizziness, my skin was so itchy I couldnt hardly stand it. I felt like I wanted to jump out of my skin. I couldnt go outside &amp; be in the sun because I got hot within 5 seconds and felt sick. I stopped taking it abruptly, I didnt notice any withdrawal symptoms at all. This med was not for me.",5,28
BuSpar,"My Prescription was increased to 300mg per day! Pharmacy blamed Doctor, Doctor blamed Pharmacy for Misreading his prescription. Patient brought it to their Attention after serious side effects. No One is Monitoring Prescriptions!  After, prescription was returned to 60 mg day, which is the maximum dose!",1,15
BuSpar,"I have been on 8 different psych meds for about 4 years now including some controlled's. I am now slowly bringing  that number down. This med did something for me, but not really enough to notice when I would not take it.",6,14
BuSpar,BuSpar  helped with bipolar anxiety only slightly but it gave me awful insomnia with angry outbursts and the worse agoraphobia. This med did more harm than good,2,22
BuSpar,"I have been on Buspar for over a month now. 5mg x2 daily. I was on Buspar several years ago and stopped because I didn't feel I needed it anymore, that was a mistake. I suffer from GAD which was destroying my life. Racing thoughts, stomach problems, constant fear and panic. This medication is not a Benzo so dont expect immediate results, for me it took approx 2 weeks before I really started to feel the effects This drug is not an SSRI and it hasn't caused any sexual problems for me as some SSRIs are known to do. The side effects I have experienced are flushing and dizziness however they subside about an hour after taking. Buspar does have a fairly short half life and I can feel the effects diminish after about 4 hours. Im also on Valium 2mg (10 per month) as needed when my anxiety becomes elevated but while on Buspar I haven't really had a need for the Valium but I'm glad I have it just in case. I would recommend this medication for anyone suffering from panic attacks/GAD. Don't give up!",8,70
BuSpar,"Buspar has changed my life in profound ways. In combination with antidepressants, it has made a huge difference for me. Before Buspar, I was debilitated by Social Anxiety Disorder. Avoidance, panic attacks, isolation... etc. Without Buspar, I felt like my whole body was raw all of the time. I started taking Buspar about 3.5 years ago and the first thing I noticed was sleepiness. But other than that, no side effects. It took a while to start working, but when it did, I was finally able to feel relaxed in public. The biggest thing is that it sedates the body. It makes me less reactive and slows down my mind. I can see how for some, this can produce a sluggish feeling, but it's exactly what I needed. The sleepiness is not a huge issue anymore. Oh, and I take Buspar 15 mg three times a day. A major downside is that I have to take it every five hours, but it's seriously like my protective armor.",9,62
BuSpar,"I was on this medication for two weeks and notice absolutely no positive effect.  However, with in those two weeks I gained 8 pounds, had an erratic heart beat, and about 20-30  minutes after taking a pill, I got extremely dizzy and lightheaded to the point I couldnt even drive.  This is just my experience and my body chemistry, but my ultimate opinion is its just another failed attempt to prevent prescribing Benzos.  Hope any of this helps.",2,43
BuSpar,"After having an anxiety attack that required a stay in a mental health residential facility, my Dr thought that this would be a great addition to my buproprion 300 mg per day for anxiety. It was going well until a few weeks in I noticed this dizzy feeling about 10 minutes after I took it and my insatiable desire for carbs. I had just lost my last 10 lbs so to see 5 of them come back on was disheartening! Weight gain wasn't listed as a side effect, but I know it caused me to gain weight and that was all I needed to know before I asked to be taken off it. I have decided to stop this medication.",4,23
BuSpar,"BuSpar was an OK experience for my anxiety, but  I have tried other meds and this one isn't as effective for my disorder.",5,17
BuSpar,"I took BuSpar for anxiety and it made me feel as though I was high or drunk, I was up and down all night sweating, it  made my eyes feel really weird and head when I laid down almost like I was still moving when I wasn't. The worst was the insomnia and the terrible nightmares it gave me. I only took 5mg twice a day and I could not function on it. There were other minor side effects but I cannot remember the exact details.",1,29
BuSpar,"If I could give this medication a rating of 0, I would. Took this for 8 months. 5mg three times a day. It took my anxiety away at first, but then everything got much much worse. Doctor told me to double my dose since panic was coming back into my life.  This drug made me feel high and very uncomfortable. Made my panic attacks worse then they had ever been. I began getting very confused and unaware of places I was at. Began getting panic attacks every single day and started missing work. Decided to quit cold turkey. Couldnt get out of bed for days. My brain had a constant fog over it. Took a solid week to where I felt normal again. I would never recommend this drug to anyone. Stopping this medication was the best thing I could have ever done.",1,41
BuSpar,"I have been on BuSpar 5mg 3 times a day for 5 weeks now for GAD. It didn't seem to start working till week 3 . The last two weeks my anxiety has decreased some and I can function a little better during the day, but I am sleeping terribly. I can fall asleep fine, but keep waking up after a couple hours feeling like my mind is still working.",5,21
BuSpar,I used this drug for anxiety and it did not help the anxiety but it did cause an asthma attack which I had never had before and have never had since.  It was terrifying.  I also experienced severe headaches.,1,23
BuSpar,"I started taking buspar with Prozac, &amp; its the perfect combination!!! I got lucky &amp; was able to feel relief from buspar when my nurse practitioner prescribed it to me. Both Prozac &amp; buspar changed my life &amp; makes me feel so much better from the awful depression &amp; anxiety! I was in such a dark place, but now I feel a lot better!",10,58
BuSpar,"Side effects were insomnia, not hungry, light headed and vivid horrible dreams. Took 5mg buspar in morning and at night. Never take this med I was on  for 3 weeks and now off for 2 week and I am still feeling the side effects. Still uneasy about leaving my home because of side effects.",2,27
BuSpar,"Buspar was a missing puzzle piece for me. I take it with Prozac and between the two, it has worked wonders. I highly recommend it with an antidepressant.",8,36
BuSpar,"Because of trouble been prescribe klonopin from doctors, I decide to wean out this medicine. I was 1.5 mg daily for 25 years and took me 6 months to get it out from my system. My new doctor  prescribed buspar in low dose first and then 10 mg x 3 daily. 2 months before I finished Klonopin , all my troubles come back with vengeance.  I developed tinnitus , my voice was weak and slurred. Buspar gave me very bad dizziness, bad balance ,heaviness on upper trunk and my legs.  I was on buspar for 2 months and I put up with these horrible side effects hoping that time will make go away. I decided to go back to klonopin and after 2 days I was a new man , I also take Zoloft . Im not saying that all my problems are over but at list I can go by and have my daily walks with no problems. Buspar works for most but not for me. Good luck guys.",2,32
BuSpar,"I had been taking Effexor and Buspar through the VA along with Clonazepam. I told doc I'd like to get off the Benzos, so I was left with Effexor. Recently I ran out of the Effexor and if you know anything about the VA, they make you come back in every time your refills run out. Even after you've been on it for years. Needless to say, I'm sick of the run-around garbage and bad service that is what veterans deal with. Ended the Effexor. Buspar made me sweat like a pig especially at night in bed. I quit it cold turkey and I'm not looking back. The only thing I take is blood pressure meds. The VA will shove anything big pharma approves of down your throat. I say quit it all . Your life will be much happier, cheaper, and cleaner.",1,39
BuSpar,My new Dr. wanted me off Xanax .05 twice a day and to take Buspirone instead. I have been on anti depressant Effexor for 14 years. I am on Gabepentian for severe sciatica and have Liver Chirrosis. So I have to be careful what I take. My medication was working great for me and then I started on Buspirone and in two days I became aggressive and then also felt buzzed and felt no way could I get behind the wheel of a car.  This was a bad drug for me. Here the Dr. is against xanax which I take for anxiety .05 2x a day and it keeps me calm without feeling any dizziness etc and puts me on Buspirone which made my head feel drunk. I am recovered alcoholic for 5 years and this drug does not work for me at all.  If it is used for drug addictions I can see why. It makes you feel high. I did not like the feeling or the headache I got the next day.  I am going back to Dr.,1,31
BuSpar,"I started taking Buspar 12/13/2018. 10mg twice daily, one at bedtime, along with a host of other medications including Klonopin  for a chronic nerve  pain condition  , Percocet for arthritis, Fibromyalgia, and a ton of other stuff, Topimax for migraines and Trigeminial Neuralgia,  a muscle relaxer, an antihistamine for my allergies and for insomnia and I dont want to forget the stool softeners of course !  Well I felt like I was gonna loose my mind AGAIN ! My skin feels  like bugs are crawling all over me, my scalp is a mess with scabs from scratching it . My TN. Is off the charts again and I cant leave the  house Im so full of anxiety .  I have a meltdown at 4:00 every day followed by 2-3 unscheduled every hour til I go to sleep.  I cant stand the face pain but my doc tells me not to stop because it takes time to work !",1,22
BuSpar,"this drug does not work, end of story...",1,30
BuSpar,"Taken for: GAD, potential panic disorder Did not help me, Side effects - strong. Immediate light headedness, would need to lay down for 30 mins to an hour Slightly reduced in intensity but did not subside for me, even after 3 months. Did not effectively treat anxiety (GAD)",2,30
BuSpar,I have used Buspar for 10 yrs I take 60 mg by taking 20mg in morning 20mg in the afternoon and 20mg at bedtime. It helps me sleep and I have energy all day. My anxiety is never over a 1 on a scale of 1-10. I love this medication it goes well with my Viibryd 40mg.,10,44
BuSpar,"I started the medication for my anxiety and bipolar. The first dose was not bad, but the second dose it took my 2 hours before I could get up, I was so dizzy and light headed. Made my panic attacks worse and felt so spaced out. I have a terrible headache that keeps coming and going.",2,23
BuSpar,"My doctors were reluctant to put me on benzos because I had a brief history of drug use. They offered buspar as an alternative, it was one of if not the worst medication Ive ever taken. It felt like Benadryl that created the most uncomfortable physical sensation and the only thing I could do was lay down in bed and wait for it to wear off. Not recommended.",1,26
BuSpar,"This medication has been a godsend for me. I'm unable to take SSRIs or SNRIs and had recently increased my dose of Wellbutrin XL (which had driven up my anxiety). The Buspar has significantly improved my anxiety symptoms and I find myself happier and more outgoing since starting it. It has mild sexual side effects on me but they are quite tolerable compared to what I have experienced in the past (if there's any chance a med like this will cause sexual side effects on somebody, I seem guaranteed to have them, no matter how small the chances). Buspar has also caused exertional headaches for me. I'm not a fan of needing to take it twice per day but it is a small tablet and easy enough to keep with me in a key fob.",7,19
BuSpar,This drug has been a miracle for me. I have all the symptoms of what one physician termed profound anxiety. NO DOCTOR until I found the right psychiatrist had even mentioned this drug. I've tried a lot of both tricyclic and SSRI and SNRI meds. All they did was give me side effects that made me feel worse. The benzodiazepines are addictive and not for a long term fix since their side effects and lasting effects are not good for the aging brain (I'm 75.),10,41
BuSpar,"I am extremely thankful this drug exists.  It has changed my life.  I suffer from PTSD from a previous illness and it has relieved my anxiety, 5 years of muscle tension and given me a clear mind.  Really mild side effects at 20MG a day.",10,34
BuSpar,"I actually felt a difference the second day but, it did take over a week to really work. I had severe anxiety from PTSD, after about 9 days on it....I feel so much better! Don't even need anti depressants now, honestly.",9,34
BuSpar,Why do I not feel good in the morning but I do feel good in afternoon.   Take same dosage of buspar in morning as in afternoon,8,18
BuSpar,"Did not really do anything except make me feel a bit dizzy, unfortunately.",2,13
BuSpar,"I was first prescribed Buspar a few years ago when my anxiety was much, much worse and neither my doctor nor I wanted me to start taking benzos. About a year into it I stopped taking it because it was making me a little too relaxed during the day, but I started it again last fall at a lower dose and I've only had positive experiences with it since. I will say it's probably more for milder GAD. I am now dealing with some pretty fresh PTSD after a violent assault a couple years ago and I've found the combination of Buspar and Lamictal to be perfect for this. I have a very high tolerance so I can't speak to any of the negative side effects, but I can say that this is milder than most but still effective enough to continue taking.",9,20
BuSpar,"30 mg day, age 70, female, white with lifelong chronic depression, +anxiety=bipolar. I have had  40 years of psych med, individual therapy &amp; my 2 pm 10mg gets me thru day w/o suicidal thoughts. + 30 yrs drag as multiple personalities. Have tried it all",10,32
BuSpar,"I've always had crippling anxiety. This medication relieves me from my anxiety without taking a scheduled medication (Xanax, Valium, Ativan, etc) and coming up in a drug screen. This medication hasn't taken my anxiety totally away (and everyone has a normal amount of anxiety), but it has diminished significantly. I've had no side effects while on this medication (I take 60mg a day) and I've been taking it for about 6 years.",9,39
BuSpar,My Dr.  prescribed  Buspar 5 .  I felt drugged with no energy.  Now taking 2.5 twice a day and feel more relaxed and energetic.  Experiment with different doses before you give up. The Dr. doesn't have a clue what dose you can tolerate as everyone is different,5,39
BuSpar,"BuSpar has significantly reduced general anxiety in my life. The first couple weeks, I felt a little out of it, almost buzzed, especially when going from 10mg to 20mg, but nothing unmanageable. To this day, I still have this sporadic and strange eye pressure that comes after I take a pill, but it's usually gone within 15 minutes.  BuSpar helped me through what otherwise would have probably been an extremely stressful divorce. The number of thoughts of imagined scenarios that rarely happen have been eliminated to almost zero. I'm also much more social and as such, confident. It hasn't helped with some things like adrenaline and subsequent anxiety from things like public speaking, but that's why there's Xanax. It's not a cure all, but it's still 10/10 if you have general anxiety.",10,36
BuSpar,It works alright on my days off when I'm not doing much. But when I have a busy day and I have to be out in public it doesn't do much at all for my anxiety.,5,11
BuSpar,They recently increased my dosage by only 5 mg. With disastrous results.  Big increase in anxiety attacks.  Bad Drug.  Caused me to experience 5 anxiety attacks in 24 Hours!  A new record for the number of anxiety attacks that Ive ever had in 24 Hours!  And they want to slowly increase it to 60 mg a Day.  No way!  Feel like rubbish!  And thats just with a small increase!,0,19
BuSpar,"Definitely curbs my generalized anxiety, and helps with my social anxiety, its not a cure all, as I still have insomnia but it has definitely improved my quality of life. SSRIs never worked for me because I felt like my depression was rooted in anxiety and not the other way around, plus SSRIs gave me panic attacks and so did trazadone after two weeks. I take 1/2 a 7.5 as soon as I wake up and then I take another half again a couple hours later then a whole one a couple hours before bed. The first two or thee days it made me feel slightly funny but its definitely beginning to level off and Im definitely much more content, less rumination, and a general feeling of well-being this far...",8,33
BuSpar,I have been down a long road. I had gotten inappropriate sinus tachycardia with stopping a beta blocker. And was put in another heart medicine to control my heart rate with less weaning side effects. Anyways they diagnosed me IST (Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia). But since being off the medicine my heart rate has been fine. Not over 100 bpm. Anyways took 2.5 mg of buspar last night and my heart rate has been under control. I just want to cry cause I haven't seen my heart normal without being on a heart medicine even then it didn't really help much. I guess I found my miracle drug and my heart rate was due to anxiety since doctors give me high anxiety and panic,8,33
BuSpar,"I'm on 15mgs of Buspar a day, its been 2 months and its not working that well. It evens me out a little but I still get anxiety attacks. I'm also gaining weight because of sugar cravings.",4,19
BuSpar,Quit drinking cold turkey after 2 years of life altering changes. Never had anxiety. Well I do now. Crippling scary moments only about midday. Morning and evening I'm fine which is weird. Was scared to death to take a med like this because other than high BP I'm good to go. Broke down and tried one 5mg dose. About an hour later I felt smooth. Was told 5mg 12 hours. I take 5mg 3 times a day. Usually every 4 hours so 15mg. 4 months sober and a month after starting Buspar it's a life saver for me. I've read that it doesn't work for everybody and everybody I'd different I understand. But it has done the trick for me so far. I tried every vitamin concoction and drink known to man with no luck. It made me very dizzy the fist couple weeks. Now I don't even notice taking it except feeling more calm. Not recommending taking it like I do but it works for me.,10,43
BuSpar,"I've had anxiety for several years with full blown panic attacks that have sent me to the ER. Fortunately, I've kept those at bay for the last year, but I still get anxiety at night. I finally decided to go to the doctor but didn't want a benzo. I was prescribed 15mg tabs, I take one at night...and it does absolutely nothing for my anxiety. If anything, it makes me a tad drowsy. Not what I was hoping for.",2,9
BuSpar,"Makes my anxiety tremendously worse, even after months of use! Don't believe the fake big pharma comments. This is not a replacement for any benzo, in any way! It is only 'known' to be 'effective' in general anxiety disorder. AFter my switch I couldn't sleep for a week, dehydrated, thought I was gonna die, so then they gave me Zoloft in conjunction with the buspar that I was already on for 2 months! The Zoloft made it even worse, I am surprised to be alive and writing this today.",1,23
BuSpar,"I have debilitating anxiety and paranoia. I hate valium, xanax etc as it causes me shocking  depression and lose all motivation. I'm currently taking pristiq, seroquel and Armodifinil. After just a few days on 10 mg twice a day I feel so much better. I've stopped the morning dose as it was causing me to feel spaced out and numb until 2pm. Been on it now two weeks and all my physical anxiety (pounding heart, shortness of breath and irrational negative thoughts) has basically disappeared!! I feel so good I've even booked an overseas holiday soon. Something impossible before the Buspar. I love this medication it's changed my outlook in life :)",9,38
BuSpar,I can take 15mg three times a day but most of the time I  only take two a day as I was told not to take after 6 pm. But it works for me great. I haven't had any side effects or anything. It keeps me relaxed and calm and even when I want to get upset I really cant. I thank God for this drug. Give it a try if you haven't.,10,33
BuSpar,"I was doing much better on Clonazepam.  I believe therapy and medication has as much to do with having quality of life than to changing to another medication.  I found that if my therapist had no experience with anxiety counselling, I didn't do well with that therapist.",4,12
BuSpar,"I have narrow angle glaucoma and there are only two anti depressive/anti anxiety drugs that will not raise my eye pressure...wellbutrin and buspar.  Wellbutrin tore up my stomach and upped my anxiety so after three months of that I switched to buspar.  I must be very sensitive to drugs because even 5mg was too much and caused brain zaps.  I cut it in half and 2.5mg seems just right so far and it's only week two.  I feel calmer and I intend to give this drug a chance to really work.  Side effects are minimal and I take my second dose mid afternoon due to sleep issues if I take it in the evening.  It doesn't do much for my depression but my depression is secondary to my anxiety.  Like I said, I'm giving it a chance.",6,12
BuSpar,Buspirone doesn't work near as well as Clonazepam. I was hopeful but hopeful does not stop my anxiety.,1,21
BuSpar,"Buspar does the job better than other medication so far. Everything else has made me feel worse.  The first couple of times I took this medication my heart rate increased and I felt dizzy. This went away after a couple of days taking it.  It makes me sick to my stomach if I take it on an empty stomach, so I definitely recommend eating a meal right before you take a pill.",6,11
BuSpar,"I started out taking 2 doses of 5 mg a day. The first few days I did notice a little mood boost but it didnt last long. We raised my dose 5 more mg (15mg a day) and same thing but it went away. Didnt help with my panic or separation anxiety. Did help with depersonalization.   It made me tired, nauseous &amp; gave diarrhea the first couple days. Those went away after that but it did give me a weird feeling about 45 minutes after taking each dose. I tapered off after 2-3 months.",4,8
BuSpar,It's working fine for me so far,8,11
BuSpar,"This was my first night of taking Buspar for anxiety 15 mg and it made it worst, I am tensed , I feel tingly , cold and jumpy. And I cant sleep at all. I do not like this feeling at all. Worst feeling ever.",0,18
BuSpar,"I've struggled with anxiety all of my life. I am also about to get tested for ADHD in my 40's. The Buspar has stopped the constant worry, but the focus issue and being scattered brained hasn't changed. My anxiety is definitely better. But it's all at a price. I feel emotionally numb. I don't really feel much anything. I'm could just sit and stare watching everyone life go by except for continuing to fidget and tapping my feet constantly. I'm on 5mg twice a day for two weeks now. Its nice to have relief from the anxiety but my fidgety mind is trapped in this sluggish emotional state. My heart and my head feel like two separate entities strangely. And my dreams are so vivid I feel like I'm in something as real as when I'm awake. I dreamed I in  an earthquake, tsunami and I saw my dog get bit in the face by a gigantic snake. I almost would rather deal with the anxiety. At least I felt normal.",7,12
BuSpar,"Horrible drug, made my anxiety worse! An hour after my second dose I became nauseous and had the spins bad.",0,15
BuSpar,DO NOT TAKE THIS CRAP! My experience was so bad I actually turned to Burboun to get me out of this hole that buspar put me in. I can only explain it like this: take the most familiar place to you and suddenly this place you know so well doesn't look the same. Like all the furniture got rearranged but nothing moved. Like your home was relocated to the twilight zone. Not cool. Neither are these people who are  taking people off meds that work and handing out garbage like this to save their own skin.,1,44
BuSpar,It took away my ability to sleep. I didnt notice anything more.,2,12
BuSpar,"I have been suffering from SEVERE anxiety all of my life. It was debilitating for me, people around would never know I was experiencing it because I would make myself losing and look happy, when really I was full of anxious energy and worry. I worried about EVERYTHING. Death mostly. It was obsessive. I never wanted try medicine so I just kept dealing with it. Recently, it peaked to the point I could no longer handle it. After researching medications I decided to try BuSpar, specifically for anxiety.  I know most do not see the benefits for at least 2 weeks, however, Im on day two and I feel  normal . I have never felt normalcy ever in my life. But I finally feel free of anxIety. I felt dizziness upon the first dose, nothing else yet.",10,59
BuSpar,"I was prescribed Buspirone in October of this year to help with anxiety and a very fast heart beat. When I originally went to see my doctor the very first time my heart rate was 116. Two weeks later, and two weeks after starting Buspirone, my heart rate was 86. It now seems to fluctuate between 98 - 74.  The first few weeks were miserable and the first week was the worst. I actually ended up quitting  on day 2 because of the dizziness and restarted a week later. When I restarted the symptoms weren't as bad. I still get dizzy sometimes but my doctor said it's most likely because my heart is slowing down.",8,14
BuSpar,Been on Buspar 6 weeks &amp; 1 day today. Trying to stay the course &amp; not give up till 8 weeks. On 15mg (3x /day) &amp; titrated my way up over the last 6 wks. Tried 20mg but felt like I took speed &amp; my extremities had very uncomfortable tingling.  Even at 6 wks when I take my 5mg dose my heart still races &amp; I get dizzy &amp; feel some heightened anxiety about an hour after taking it. Lasts about an hour. I also have some left leg thigh pain now. Ive read so much on this drug &amp; its hard to know if you should go up or down in dose to get the right level for your body. My pDoc doesnt seem to know much more than I do.  In those 6 wks Ive only had a few hours out of 2 non-consecutive days of anxiety/fear relief.  Ill write another review at 8 wks,6,23
BuSpar,"I started Buspar 2 months ago and at first I did have the side effects for the first 3 weeks, but was given anti nausea med and reduced the nausea. Have lost 12 pounds and have kept it off. Eating a little as no changes in what I eat. No sweets. And that makes me happy. And no more anxiety",10,22
BuSpar,I've been begging for years to take an anti anxiety medication. I was initially diagnosed with depression &amp; anxiety. My neurologist increased my Effexor from 75mg to 150mg/day to treat the numbness and tingling in my feet due to diabetes. I became manic with my driving and spending habits. I was then re-diagnosed as being bipolar. I went years without anxiety medication and had several trips to the hospital with anxiety attacks that felt more like heart attacks.  I was put on Buspar and took my first dose last night. This morning I couldn't find my wig. I ended up late to work in hopes of locating it. It's not where I left it and I wonder if I was sleep walking. Anyone experience anything similar?,5,15
BuSpar,I had high hopes that this would help my anxiety but it seems like it made my anxiety a lot worse. I now experience bad nausea and trembling which didn't happen before. I also had low appetite and more severe anxiety attacks.  I took 15mg twice a day for six weeks. Thankfully it doesn't have withdrawal effects but unfortunately it didn't work for me.,2,29
BuSpar,"I've been on Buspar for two years. The drug does not 'kick in' quickly, but once it does start working, one notices a nice, quiet calm. (It started working for me after ~ 30 days. )It's nothing like the benzodiazepines (thank goodness) and does not make me feel like a zombie with memory problems like Clonazepam (Klonopin) or Valium, etc. I use this in conjunction with Cymbalta and this combination helps me with both anxiety and depression. The only side effect I notice is that I might sweat a bit more. It is non-addictive, but as with any drug used long-term, one become physically dependent upon Buspar and one should follow a withdrawal schedule formulated by your PCP.",9,29
BuSpar,"I augmented my SSRI Lexapro with BuSpar to help bring my initial startup anxiety down the first few weeks of starting an SSRI. I must be one of the lucky people who found BuSpar to be effective because it did greatly relieve my anxiety, especially tapering up my dosage over a few weeks time. I only had to take one Xanax over the period of a month when starting up my SSRI thanks to BuSpar.",7,32
BuSpar,"Overall- waste of money long term because it only works for a few weeks.  Exercise and meditation will be more beneficial.  However, if you're doing exposure therapy in addition to, those few weeks the medicine is working may help you overcome the initial hurdle.  Initial side effects were dizziness and terrible fatigue.  Only lasted first 3-4 days, then you could feel the medicine start working.  Buspar only worked for two weeks though.  Regardless, I took it 4-5 months while still having regular anxiety attacks.  I started tapering off last week, and thankfully no withdrawal symptoms (not like Xanax).  That is at least a plus.",2,16
BuSpar,"My doctor prescribed Buspar 5mg 3x daily as I eased off Effexor. The Effexor worked great except for the sexual side affects and the hardcore addiction. I have nothing good to say about Buspar. I thought I was losing my mind. Felt severely unbalanced. Nauseated. Confused. Thirsty. Insomnia. You name it! My endocrinologist thought I might be diabetic because of family history. No, it was all the Buspar. Why should something that is suppose to help generalised anxiety make you feel like you are losing it?  I ended up slowly getting off of Effexor and pitching the Buspar. I need something for generalised anxiety but I am scared of another bad trip.",1,33
BuSpar,"Took buspirone for 2 days. It definitely helped me stay calm, but made me drowsy during the day and gave me the worst insomnia I've ever experienced at night. I know trialling it 2 days is nothing for a med, but I have a family and a demanding job where I cannot afford to not get at least a couple hours of sleep a day. The severe insomnia alone is enough for me to stop taking it. I also got insomnia from the two antidepressants I took (generic Paxil and Zoloft), so I am very sensitive to meds. I will say this though, it did seem to keep my calm and better able to focus. It works in those terms. I would recommend anyone who hasn't had success using anti depressants to try buspar/buspirone for anxiety. It just might be your golden ticket.",0,27
BuSpar,"After years of klonopin/Xanax &amp; zolft, MY so-called Dr switches me to Buspar&amp; Lexapro. This is the most worthless bunch of junk medicine ever created. It just sent me into benzo withdrawals !!! Horrible ones that last days. I have to find another Dr that had mercy on me and put me back on Xanax.",1,26
BuSpar,"I love this drug! I started 4 yrs ago when I was just starting recovery from sex addiction and childhood sexual abuse and trauma, and I started out on just 5 mg/day. Within a week, I noticed my anxiety significantly lessen. Within 3 weeks, I was able to stop compulsively having sex with a new guy every week. It helped me get my life back on track, and about 9 months later, I finally started taking it as prescribed (5mg twice per day,) and the difference was even more significant. I slept better, had fewer racing thoughts, and I stopped obsessing about my therapist as much. It didn't cause any weight gain and had virtually no side effects after the initial blurry vision for the first few days. Highly recommend Buspar!",0,75
BuSpar,I have been on Buspar for about 2 months now for anxiety from keppra. It seems to work sometime but when I get an anxiety or panic attack it hits hard. I was on 5mg twice a day and now my dose is really high. Like today it seems to have no effect. And I'm always lightheaded dizzy fogged out feeling. And my other doctor said to try Xanax.,3,16
BuSpar,I was prescribed this drug for anxiety I took it home and managed to take it for 2 days but immediately noticed severe insomnia that after two days made me stop taking it. On top of the inability to sleep despite feeling tired I had absolutely zero appetite. In the little over 48 hours I had only managed to eat a handful of cherries...  However when I was on the drug I did notice less irritability and increased fatigue which I attributed to not sleeping or eating.,3,23
BuSpar,"I started talking this medication last Monday and was only on it for 4 days before I had to quit. I had so many of the different side effects of this drug like lack of appetite, stomach upset, extremely worse anxiety than I had before I started and extreme drowsiness during the day but insomnia at night. It was an absolute nightmare for me but that doesn't mean it wouldn't work for someone else.",0,23
BuSpar,"I started out on 5 mg, 3 times day and am now at 10 mg 3-4 times a day. I've experienced no side effects. I do feel less anxiety (constant worry, easily irritated), but feel it come back about 5 hours later. It has taken the edge off of social anxiety but has taken about 2 months to get there. It is a mild anti anxiety med. It doesn't make you feel drugged or spaced out. It helps to give you the ability to stop the anxious thoughts but doesn't seem to do it all for you. I have ADD as well and take Wellbutrin along with Buspar. I have taken Lexapro and although it does wonders for anxiety it also caused me to feel a bit manic over time. Lexapro also wiped out my memory. I have a grandson now and I want to remember and be at my best for him.",8,30
BuSpar,This medication did not work for my anxiety.  BuSpar actually allowed my anxiety to increase with severe insomnia and vivid dreams.  It also caused severe stomach and intestinal problems.  I also experienced dizziness irritability and incoordination.  There are other symptoms from BuSpar these are the main ones that caused me to stop  taking the drug.,1,21
BuSpar,I was on 15 mg of buspirone for many months. I recently lost my job and have a lot of anxiety and depression. I am seeing a psychiatrist who said my dose was too low and upped it to 60 mg a day. I still don't feel like it is working. I am also on Zoloft. I still am having a lot of anxiety. Years ago I was on Ativan and it was a miracle drug for me. I would like to stop the buspirone and just take the Ativan as needed. I see my psychiatrist in a couple weeks and am going to suggest that. I also have the feeling of a huge lump in my throat that I know is stress related.,2,29
BuSpar,Developed anxiety and panic again after not having it for 30 years.  Could  have been triggered by an attack of vertigo.  Dr. put me on Buspar 10mg twice a day.  I was also on Prozac 20 mg once a day and Clonopin 0.5mg once at night for years and felt just fine.  The Buspar made me spacey and did not help the anxiety.  They reduced it to 5mg twice a day.  Still a little spacey and did not help anxiety.  Upped my Clonopin to an extra 0.5mg in morning and 0.25mg in afternoon.  Buspar is not helping.  Going to ask my doctor to change to something else.  Been on it almost a couple of months.  Any help anyone can give me?  Thanks so much.  I am also afraid to be alone at home since hubby works 2nd shift but is going to 1st shift next week which will help.,2,16
BuSpar,"I've been on this for about 3 weeks now. At first I thought it was helping my anxiety a bit but then I realized it was just making me tired and loopy after I took it, and that's worn off now (which is good but now I realized it wasn't helping). Giving it 3 stars because it didn't hurt me except for the tired loopy feeling, and I can't orgasm easily at all. Also my appetite is gone so I've lost some weight, which is nice except having no appetite meant I wasn't taking in enough calories so I was even more tired. Basically it was just pointless and didn't help.",2,19
BuSpar,"I used buspar 5mg once every few years.  It's very good for me and very mild.  I tried double dosage once and I was groggy.  But on 5mg, I was perfectly normal.  When I get my anxiety attack (once every decade or so) my hands shake, can't eat, color of my face goes pale....  but immediately soon after taking buspar, I feel much better. Please note that these medication don't work just as well on everybody.  The nature of psychotropic medication would work wonders on one person, and horribly or not at all one another person.  You gotta keep trying until you find something that works for you.",10,37
BuSpar,"I did not like this medication nor do I recommend it.  I don't know if I was taking a low dose or a normal dose but I was on 10 mg twice a day. That medication made me feel very tingly, I felt like a rubberband that was stretched pulled, this was a daily feeling, it was scary.   I also had feelings of not being able to control myself. For example when washing dishes I felt that I was out of control. So I hurried and washed dishes.  I took this medication for about 2 months, I stopped taking it. I will never again take it again.  What did help me with 95% of my anxiety attacks was to stay away from sugar and flour products. Now I rarely have anxiety attacks. More Protein!",1,32
BuSpar,"I'm taking buspar for anxiety that I'm having due to an injury. I broke my wrist about 8 weeks ago, and I am in a cast from the tip of my thumb to just below the elbow. My Dr. told me I might be in this cast for 12 weeks or significantly longer. I started having bad anxiety and panic attacks. So my family Dr. put me on buspar and zoloft for the duration of being in a cast. So far it hasn't seemed to help very much, 7.5 mg twice daily. I'm hoping that it will start helping with the anxiety. I do feel a little light headed and I'm always tried. This isn't my first broken bone or cast, but this is the first time I've ever experienced anxiety.",0,21
BuSpar,"I have debilitating anxiety which keeps me from leaving the house many days. Before, I would cry almost daily, even when life was going better. The little things tore me apart. With the buspar... it's like I'm getting moments back. I still get anxious sometimes, but I have occasional periods of feeling. ... normal. Clear. Simple, natural interactions with family and friends are possible again. As time goes on, I'm experiencing more and more moments of real life again, or, life before anxiety. Multiple friends have told me I seem much happier. Though I don't particularly think of myself as suddenly  all sunshine and roses,  I feel like I have my life back. I'm actually living again.",10,141
BuSpar,I am taking the buspar but it making me feel too relaxed and giving me worse anxiety. My whole body is tingly and I have a huge headache I don't have anything else that to take but I am so afraid to take it - it is Saturday I can't get a hold of my dr. I just don't what to anymore anyone have any ideas,4,21
BuSpar,"I started on 5 mg for anxiety caused by my OCD. I got bumped to 7.5 and within 3 days could feel some of the terrible anxiety burn I get in my upper back go away. A month went by and I had a terrible setback with depression because I could no longer could deal with my panic &amp; OCD. Doctor bumped me to 10 mg. Same pattern occurred.... within 3 days I was feeling better. In fact, had the best day in a while. It might just be a coincidence and therapy might be helping in conjunction with, but I notice Buspar does help with my extreme anxiety, but only when I went above 5 mg. I have not noticed any side effects. I'm also taking zoloft, zyprexa 2.5, and klonipin .25. I have endured a lot with panic attacks, OCD, and depression hence all the meds.",10,52
BuSpar,"So, I give this 7 out of 10. I'd give it 10 out of 10, but the first week on this was really uncomfortable. I almost stopped using it. I started out at 10 mg buspar once a day and then after a week increased to 10 twice a day . The first week, I won't lie, was a doozy. My psych said that her patients either love it or hate it and it's pretty much 50/50 with little gray area. But since it's inexpensive, been around for a while, and is pretty safe, she likes that to be the first option when dealing with GAD. Fair. The first week, I was really, really dizzy. Felt a bit fuzzy in the head. kind of jumpy. I had to pull over while driving and sit down for a bit. BUT after about two weeks. Whoah. My life is changed. I'm no longer so anxious!!",7,86
BuSpar,"I'm on the fence about this medication, I used it for generalized anxiety disorder which was exacerbated after my mother passed away unexpectedly. Well I have to say, I was shaky like I was just as anxious, so I though it was the anxiety, so I stopped the medication after 6 months and I am not shaky anymore, I also feel like everything is clearer. I was on a very light dose 2.5mg three times a day.  Maybe I did not take enough. So he gave me Lexapro, which I have not started, I am holding out, when I get anxious I take a half of a .25 xanax and it keeps the anxiety away. So if I was to say I don't think this medication helped very much.  Maybe at a higher dose, I don't know.  I am skeptical about taking anything like this.",3,26
BuSpar,"Works well in combination with an SSRI. I stopped Buspar due to drowsiness and immediate weight gain. I experienced increased appetite and wanted to eat constantly.  I was diagnosed with Adult Attention Deficit Disorder without Hyperactivity. I currently take Adderall, low dose Wellbutrin XL, and low dose Prozac.  The Prozac and Wellbutrin XL assist in alleviating depressive symptoms during the winter months.  Everyone is unique. Talk to your doctor; follow their advice.",5,27
BuSpar,Cannot see any difference in depression,0,16
BuSpar,Didn't do anything but make me tired.. started at 15mg and went all the way up to 60mg with no improvement.,3,21
BuSpar,I think buspar is working really well for me.. I also take zoloft and its a great combination so far. I do get a little dizzy but my anxiety was so bad that I'd rather be a little dizzy than anxious..,9,52
BuSpar,"Have had anxiety for many years, have tried numerous meds and none worked for long. Because of numerous surgeries I have a high drug tolerance and sometimes weird reactions. After taking Cymbalta for 3 years the excessive sweating just became too much, I am now on Lexapro and was using Clonazapan when an attack would start,concerned about addiction to Clonazapan my doctor suggested Buspar. I started with 7.5 twice a day did not feel much until starting the third week then 10mg 3xs a day. Did have side effects but was encouraged to wait 4wks, so glad I did. 1st time in years and I mean years, I feel like the old me, sleep through the night, no side effects. I encourage you to wait and see before you give up on it, for me well worth it.",9,133
BuSpar,"Have been on Buspar for a few months, and I like it a lot! It has made severe and paralyzing anxiety lift to a manageable level, even while taking a low dosage of 10 mg daily. My Dr. told me that I can increase the dosage, since in taking so little it doesn't rid me of anxiety completely (no med can). But I noticed that when I upped my dose my appetite came back more than I would have liked. Essentially, I think it works to strengthen my SSRI (sertraline); and I did have dizziness when I first started and felt pretty bad, but that's common for anti-anxieties and usually goes away as your body gets used to it. I do still find however after I take my morning dose (usually) with coffee I do feel a bit woozy but it usually wears off quickly.",8,62
BuSpar,"This stuff is HORRIBLE. Made me very irritated/jumpy/even more anxious. Felt like my mind was racing...felt even more overwhelmed. This is the worst stuff I've been on yet..I had to stop taking it because I couldn't even function right.  This stuff is really, really bad.. doc put me on Lexapro today hopefully that helps!!",1,39
BuSpar,"I've been on bupropion for depression several years with dry mouth being the only side effect. Panic attacks started a couple of years ago. Take Xanax and it works great for me. Last year the panic attacks started occurring more often with severe anxiety this past fall. I didn't want to get addicted to Xanax by taking several times or more a week. Started Buspirone 7.5 mg 2/x per day. I felt relief from my anxiety in about 3 weeks, but around 8-10 week mark I felt like it contributed to weight gain and bloating . Taking 7.5 only once a day lessened side effects. However 3mo. now weight gain is 5-6 lbs (a lot for 5'1), bloated and water retention none of which is reducing with proper diet, exercise and increased water intake.",7,45
BuSpar,"I left a review awhile back, but now I have to revise it. When I first started taking Buspar I was happy with it, but then it stopped working for me. I'm now on the max dosage of 60 mg. I take 30 mg in the morning &amp; 30 mg in the evening, but it is not helping me at all. I still have very bad anxiety, panic attacks &amp; paranoia. Since it isn't doing anything for me I will probably stop taking it.",1,40
BuSpar,"I've had panic and general anxiety for years. It's been exacerbated by hormonal changes and menopause, and I've had major trouble getting a full night's sleep. I have used Xanax occasionally and love the way it eliminates my anxiety, but I don't want to get addicted. My doc had me try a low dose Buspar and it didn't work for me at all. Gave me a horrendous headache, very very painful. I tried it for about three days and had the same experience every time. I had to stop taking it since this side effect was debilitating. I was hoping it would work for me, and so glad it works for others. Just putting my experience out there in case others have this problem. I'm trying Celexa now instead and have learned to limit Xanax usage.",1,34
BuSpar,"I've long used BuSpar, and it is an odd duck. Alone, it did little, but in combination with other meds it's amazing. Particularly SSRIs. It seems to amplify other meds, from painkillers to Prozac. It's not something I'm afraid to take, the boost is subtle but it definitely helps my anxiety slip away. I've not noticed any sick withdrawal efffects, being off it once for 2 months. I take 30 mg/day in two 15 mg doses.",8,60
BuSpar,"I started Buspar because I was having anxiety with the horrendous pain from gallbladder attacks. I started out at 7.5 for three days and then was supposed to advance to 15 mg.  During the week of starting this, I had to have an emergency surgery for my gallbladder.  When I was finally able to take this consistently, I found that I suffered from insomnia, felt restless and nervous, dizzy, and down right horrible. I have taken it less than a week and I have an appointment to see the doctor tomorrow.  If I stop taking this, will I have withdrawal symptoms?  Or should I do this gradually?  My gallbladder symptoms are gone and my body feels great after the surgery.  Any suggestions?",1,27
BuSpar,"I've been on Buspar for 7 days, and I have already noticed that my life-long intrusive thoughts/rumination have died down a lot. I have also noticed a decrease in social anxiety. I'm taking 15mg a day, 7.5 morning/evening. I wasn't on anything before, so I have nothing to compare to but my untreated state.",8,80
BuSpar,Needed something for severe anxiety and this worked really well at first. I was amazed at how well it worked for the first month and then it all went downhill from there which is strange because I have read it takes a month to work in some people. Was taking 2 doses a day and it worked great but it was short lived. Tried 3 doses a day and that only made it worse. Just felt horrible on it after a couple of months. Maybe it will  work for you but it was not for me,3,41
BuSpar,"I started taking buspar about 2 months ago. I started having brain zaps and I thought it was temporary. It was not. I started getting water retention and I wanted to eat more than usual. I also was extremely irritable constantly.  I was told to take 5mg twice daily. I started with half a pill then after a week the whole pill 2x daily.  I since then I decreased my dose to half. Now I'm off completely.  All of the side effects have stopped almost immediately.  No brain zaps, irritability decreased slowly, and water retention stopped.  This pill didn't do anything except all of the bad. On the positive side - getting off of it does not give you severe withdrawal.",1,32
BuSpar,"I have Epilepsy as well as Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I have been taking Klonopin and my Doctor is concerned about addictive behavior, so she put me on Buspar and decreased Klonopin. After the first dose, I had a massive panic attack (which can trigger seizures) so I also had a seizure in which I had to go to the E.R for. It also made my hands and feet sweaty, I was shaky all over, and always anxious. I was very appreciative that my doctor let me get off of Buspirone because it is just awful! I would not recommend it to anyone, especially patients who have epilepsy!",1,27
BuSpar,I'm a 32 year old male and I've been taking buspar for about 10 months. At first it did nothing but make my anxiety worse. I would wake up with to full blown panic attacks and have the worse nightmares ever. However I'm now taking 40mg of citaloptam a day mixed with the buspar 15mg and 1mg of xanax twice a day. And Zanax! I have  insomnia mixed with with deep anxiety issues. The problem that I have is the buspar makes me so fat! I'm literally considering stop taking it and just see of the other meds can help. Buspar Alone is no  substitution for anxiety drug and wouldn't recommend it...,3,23
BuSpar,Good medicine,7,8
BuSpar,"This drug is awful. My Dr. took me off my klonopin because she was worried about addictive behavior.   This drug i only took ! time and will not take again. It made me very dizzy, sick to my stomach, my hear was racing. It basically gave me the worst panic attack I've ever had. Odd since this is supposed to be for anxiety. I understand the risk with taking benzos but it the only thing that has ever helped me. I would recomend never taking buspar.",1,36
BuSpar,"Geeze. I started buspar 2 weeks ago in hospital. They had me taking 5mg twice a day. My psyc said too take three times a day because I have come off adavan. My issue is, the first dise works great, the second one I take at 6:00 knocks me on my butt after I eat. Literally I become kinda lathargic, I am also med sensitive. Help please",0,24
BuSpar,I am always hungry since starting Buspar and getting fat! But it does help with anxiety. Doctor denies it can cause weight gain. How can I stop gaining weight and lose??,5,44
BuSpar,"I have severe panic disorder for years now. I've been taken off ativan and put on buspar, 15mg 3 times a day. I feel amazing. no full blown panic attacks in weeks, thats a true miracle for me. my appetite is low, and I'm losing much needed weight. I'm also on neurontin for anxiety, lexapro for anxiety and depression. I have to say, this is the best I've felt in over 10 years. this buspar works for me, amazing drug.",8,71
BuSpar,"I tried buspar in addition to 200mg of zoloft. it was meant to enhance the zoloft. Unfortunately , it didn't work for me. I was on it for about 5 months, and during that time i kept having on and off discomfort , like my heart was beating harder,my stomach was always really bloated, my body heat would rise and I'd have a hard time cooling down. The symptoms were so mild I didn't really pay much attention to it, but after a while i got tired of the negative side effects and decided to call it quits. Almost immediately after i stopped taking the medication, all of those negative symptoms went away so I definitely know it was the buspar. if anyone has similar side effects, just stop the medication after two weeks max, its not worth it.",3,29
BuSpar,"I was just wondering what does everyone started out at, and if and when they knew to increase. I am currently at 5mg 2x day, I originally started out just taking 5mgs once a day at night, and then just recently increased to 5mgs 2xs a day. I know that is has helped, but i am still waking up anxious, and having some breakthrough anxiety in the day. I was wondering how others increased their does, and how they knew when they were at the right does for them.",8,30
BuSpar,"I can say, Buspar (Buspirone) has helped me.  I am also on 40 mg Citalopram once day and 5 mg Buspar twice daily.    I have experienced way less anxiety, able to enjoy life better.",10,36
BuSpar,"Buspar (or buspirone hydrochloride) works very well for me.  I have severe social anxiety and i never could talk to people.  It's still weird sometimes talking to people but i don't feel as nervous while I'm talking or when people i don't know start a conversation with me. I was taking xanax before but that wasn't working. Buspar works much better and is much safer in my opinion. I take 60 mgs a day,  15 mgs in the morning,  15mgs in the afternoon and 30mgs in the evening. It's very effective.",9,57
BuSpar,"Just a little back story for you I am on low-dose Suboxone for opiate addiction that I had throughout most of my twenties (I'm 30 years old now  ; I also have anxiety) . For the past 6 months my .50 milligrams of Suboxone has helped me be clean and sober without any Cravings whatsoever !!   On day 4 of taking Buspar,  I started drug seeking Behavior . Literally was a wreck.  I was told that this would not have any interactions , that was clearly not the case with me . Please use with caution if you're an addict. It was literally a nightmare =(",1,38
BuSpar,Before starting buspirone I read some awful reviews on it which made me not want to take it. I am now glad that I did start taking it as I've had zero side effects and it is slowly making me feel a little more human.,9,105
BuSpar,"23 male, been taking buspar for 3 years now for anxiety/ocd with intrusive thoughts. I originally started with 10mg 2x a day. Took about 2-3 weeks to take effect, after that I really noticed a difference in my anxiety and intrusive thoughts. It really helped me get through the day and feel normal. I occasionally still had panic attacks that would eventually pass with drinking a bunch of water and sometimes taking an extra helper dose. Recently switched to 3x a day still at 10mg since the med doesn't seem to last as long as it used to. Still occasionally take a helper dose to fall asleep. Side affects were/still are antsy legs, dizziness, drowsiness, and extreme appetite all for only about 30 min. Overall better than anti-depressants.",7,37
BuSpar,You have to take this for about a month before you will notice a difference in your anxiety. Please don't take anyone else's medications. It's illegal and unsafe. Work closely with your MD to find the dose that's right for you and it can help a lot. I'm an ER nurse. It worked for me. Peace!,0,82
BuSpar,"Buspar has been a godsend for me. First, was on 10mgs twice a day. Now I'm on 15mgs twice a day. No side effects and I've had no need for benzos since. On one year now.",9,102
BuSpar,"It didn't help at all with the panic attacks and actually made my anxiety worse. The first few weeks it would just put me to sleep. After four weeks I became very depressed and had suicidal thoughts constantly throughout the day. It gave me horrible headaches, it made me really dizzy all the time and I felt lightheaded and nauseous often. After four weeks I could not sleep at all and my anxiety increased along with the panic attacks. I don't recommend this medicine for anyone who has suffered PTSD or who has had high anxiety levels for a long time. It just makes things worse. After five weeks I stopped taking this medication I could no longer handle the side effects.",1,48
BuSpar,"I was prescribed Buspar for anxiety. If I knew that Buspar had the side effects that I got, I would never drink it. I drank it for 4 days only and it almost got me killed. I started having panic attacks, I could hardly breath, I had electric shocks, brain zaps,  horrible medicine. I quit right away. Little I knew that quitting even after 4 days would cause side effects. I could not sleep for 2 weeks afterwards, I thought I was dying. Horrible medicine. I will never drink any anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medicin that is not natural!!!!",1,30
BuSpar,I was recently prescribed Cymbalta for depression.  It helped but I felt very jittery and anxious on it. My doctor added Buspar and now I feel very much calmer and in control. I take 30 mgs twice a day.,10,46
BuSpar,"Anxiety was eating me alive! Finally I went to my Dr to ask for help. I started with 7.5 mg twice a day and she worked me up to 15mg twice a day. I feel so much better! I'm sleeping like a log now because anxiety is not keeping me awake or waking me up. I do feel hot and a little shaky about 20 minutes after I take it but it don't last very long, maybe 30 minutes. I'm also losing some much needed weight. Probably because I'm not eating at night since I'm actually sleeping through the night for the first time in my life! This stuff changed my life for the better!",10,126
BuSpar,I have been taking buspar for 4 months now and it has helped pretty well for my anxiety. I take 3 10mg a day. I mostly like it because it helps with the extra anxiety and slight depression i get from the come down off of my adderall i take for adhd every day too. The only side effects I've had from the buspar has been nausea but as long as i eat a little bit of food whenever i take them it subsides that pretty well so i would recommend it to anyone with the same situation.,8,73
BuSpar,"I have taken buspar for 5 months. Prescribed max dose of 15mg 4x/day. It took a couple weeks to actually notice the difference. I don't feel like a zombie after taking it. I really just came to the realization one day while driving to work, an activity that used to leave me recovering from an anxiety attack, was suddenly a very simple task. My social anxiety, much improved. It's very subtle, but after sticking with it, I can look back and I see that it changed my life. It does make me sleepy, in a walking around functioning while yawning kind of way and I get a lot of headaches. The good definitely outweighs The bad. I can take a lower dosage on easy days and still have a positive outcome. also take 150mg of Zoloft and 25 mg Wellbutrin",10,58
BuSpar,"It has done great for me. I used to bite my kids' heads off in the mornings and startle a lot easier, for examples. I can also take it in small doses at a time to keep from sleeping all day from the side effects.",9,59
BuSpar,"was on 20 mg Cipralex  then doctor added q 150 Buspar within 2 weeks my anxiety and depression got a lot worse, trouble sleeping and uncontrolled shaking Not for me",1,30
BuSpar,Started a 90 day prescription right after I had my daughter and it was horrible. Gave me anxiety and terrible panic attacks. I had to hop in a cold shower once. I felt as if I was gonna have a heart attack or my chest explode. Just got prescribed wellbutrin hoping to have better luck.,1,39
BuSpar,My anxiety was extremely bad and I had tried lexapro but the side effects for me were horrible; so my doctor started new on BuSpar. I've been on it now going on two weeks and I can say I do feel a slight difference. My anxiety is still there but not as bad... I'm still having attacks off and on but I'm going to stick with this and give it some more time. The only side effect I have is the dizziness but I've learned if I eat even just a piece of toast that it helps with that. Other than that no side effects. I say if your suffering give this a try and stick with it.,8,87
BuSpar,"I had depression for years and in that last 8 months that turned into anxiety that gave severe shoulder and abdominal pain , sweaty palms and pounding heart , ruined my career and my social life and affected my decision making . Finally after trying to fight it with out using medication I had to go see a doctor because I couldn't take it anymore , doctor gave me buspirone and recomanded 3x 5mg a day . I started with 1 5mg every 24 hours and I can tell a difference , I am calm and I sleep better . The physical pain is almost gone which I assume was happening due to surge of my stress hormones which are now under control . It has been 3 days of peace and quite and hope it stays this way .",8,113
BuSpar,"One week on, started full dose yesterday. 30m.  No side effects, and no haziness. I get slightly dizzy but doesn't interfere with walking.  I have tried 3 others before this, And each time I had flu symptoms, couldn't leave the bathroom, couldn't work or take care of my children. This medicine has been nothing but great for me, I haven't had a headache or the tremors for a few days which is already life changing! I can focus, and I have slowly realized that my mind is quieting down:) if nothing has worked for you, please give this a try! No addiction to it they say..  I'm excited that I feel this great:) I can't wait to see what next week and the week after is. I'm looking forward to tomorrow, which is a foreign feeling.  Good luck:)",8,141
BuSpar,Tried all the benzodiazepines with no luck. Then they tried Buspar and it changed my life.,10,122
BuSpar,I am on Buspar and 5 milligrams once a day I feel that if I take it all at once and it does not work I am so lost because I can't stand this dizziness nausea in my stomach my feet feel like they're falling out from underneath me I really am lost the doctor wants me to stay on it but I do not want to up it because I feel like I keep going through these side effects over and over again every day due to the fact of it being Half-Life what do I do from here,3,24
BuSpar,"I've been taking Buspar for a year. I feel like I can mange my life better when I'm on it. I can cope so much better with my life's stressors, especially the ones related to taking care of my daughter, who has autism. I used to get overwhelmed easily. With the busar I am more patient, not explosive or impulsive. Also, I used to have so many negative or catastrophic as automatic thoughts all the time. On Buspar I rarely have them. Buspar has worked great for me.",0,123
BuSpar,"Buspar lifted the anxiety ever so gently. I take 3 10 mg tablets per day and it's only $6 per month when prescribed that way. 2 15mg pills a day was $45. As if the relief from anxiety wasn't wonderful enough, after the first 3 years I went from getting plastered with viruses, to just 1 or 2  a year.  Think about it...anxiety causes the brain to send out massive amounts of cortisol and adrenaline, which seriously compromises your immune system. Less cortisol &amp; adrenaline equals a stronger immune system.  Then there's the enhanced sexual experience for a percentage of us...and that's a little personal, but very appreciated!",0,144
BuSpar,"I initially was prescribed this a few months ago at 10 mg 3xd, but it made me headachy and almost made my anxiety worse, so I quit taking it. I cannot take benzos, and recently am having more problems with anxiety, so I'm trying it at 5 mg 3xd. Now I see what others have been talking positively about. It's very subtle, but apparently I was just taking too much for my system before. So far, so good.",7,101
BuSpar,I was taking ativan from a friend for my slight anxiety issue. It was 1mg I stopped it for two weeks started getting weird feelings in my head. Then had panic attack for the first time. Turns out I'm addicted to the ativan. My doctor gave me .5 ativan didn't stop the attacks and couldn't function right. I had to take a full 1 mg to function. When ever I don't take it I get a panic attack. Well my PcP gave me buspar and been doing better. I been on it two days he wants me to take 15 mg four times a day but that's too much I take 7.5 and feel normal. Taking a full 15 mg is a no no. But at the right dosage it works. Hopefully soon to kick the ativan out. Of missed worked because of this ativan problem. I don't suggest taking any benzodiazepines.,7,62
BuSpar,"I began taking buspar about six weeks ago. I am not a fan of benzos because they are addictive, I prefer to function with a clear head rather than popping a pill that sedates me so badly that maybe I'm not feeling my anxiety, but I'm also not living my life or doing much else either. Buspar has changed my life, I had completely forgotten what it was like to have a quiet mind until now. My obsessive thoughts subsided, I can leave my house without fear, I can speak to my friends and to strangers without profusely sweating and trembling, and I can drive again now that I'm not so easily stimulated. It takes a few weeks to feel the full effect, so hang in there if you just began.",9,236
BuSpar,Helps so much.,7,37
BuSpar,"I was suffering from such bad anxiety that I felt desperate. I wanted it gone so I waited the six weeks it took to get into a psychiatrist. She prescribed me Buspar and within the first day the meds started to kick in. I took the first dose and then the second as she prescribed me 5mg twice a day to start. I could feel the chemicals in my brain changing and suppressing the anxiety and it was a relief! Let me warn you though, anyone with true anxiety also suffers from depression too so once the anxiety is taken care of with Buspar the depression comes on so much stronger! I'm on Zoloft and Buspar. Used to just be on Paxil until it stopped working.",10,93
BuSpar,"I suffer from anxiety,depression and PTSD.  This medicine has proven to be a great alternative over a benzo.  Being non habit forming is the best par .  I do get headaches and fatigue but it is better then the side effects associated with benzo.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a non addictive alternative to zanex",7,88
BuSpar,I'm returning to Buspar after seven years off. Started having chronic anxiety attacks again after my wife's hysterectomy. Wish I could remember my old dosage. I tend to be drug sensitive and the 30 mg. dosage made me fuzzy. The PA that did this script was a little overzealous. Doing well on just the 15 mg. even if it is a self-adjusted dosage. After a few weeks I can have a talk with our MD and he'll probably leave it at 15 or 20.,9,65
BuSpar,"My Dr. Prescribed due to it low dosage. And that I didn't want to take meds. I became so helpless after years of trying to cope with anxiety on my own, I finally reached a point where medicine was my only hope.  It kicked in quickly, my obssesive thoughts stopped, then dosage would wear off so I started taking a higher dosage, then it made me become upset, super emo crying, not myself and finally realized it was  buspar. Cut back dosage again. It made me tired all the time, couldn't concentrate, weird dreams, and loss of interest in things. Was not a good fit, I finally had to ask Dr for something else after a year it didn't work all together except for stopping obssesive thoughts. It also gave me brain zaps, memory loss, and space cadet syndr",2,64
BuSpar,I've been on Busiprone (10 mg twice a day) for about 2 weeks now and I have seen no improvement. My sleep is jacked up from it from either interupted sleep or vivid dreams. I dont think I'm going to continue to use it. Xanax seemed to be the only thing that has helped me so far..,2,50
BuSpar,I started taking Buspar 5mg twice a day due to anxiety of my Mom being in the hospital. Let me tell you how it affects me...positively. I take it along with Prozac 20mg once a day and the combination works WONDERS for me. I take both in the morning and the Buspar in the afternoon around 4pm. What a difference!!,10,84
BuSpar,"Diagnosed with general anxiety disorder.  Would have obsessive thoughts non stop, losing sleep sometimes.  Started taking buspar 5mg twice a day.  Hands felt tingling and head a little cloudy but no other real side affect.  Increased up to 10mg.  Immediately saw improvement, no more obsessive thoughts that would normally slow me at my work.  Been on it for almost a year now and have no side affects.",10,131
BuSpar,"I have had anxiety for 10 years and had given up all hope for a normal life.  Last year i was prescribed Buspar 15mg a day and it did nothing for me.  On one of my many visits to the mental hospital I was told to try bumping it up to 40mg.  A week later I had my first anxiety free day.  It's now been 7 months and I haven't had a single anxiety day.  I have finally started to love again, I feel normal.  My doctor said that because it's not addictive and doesn't lose its effects over time like Benzos I can continue to take it indefinitely so I will.  If you're on it and it's not working perhaps you may need more For me it's finally given me my life back",10,176
BuSpar,Well this medication improved my mood related to possible social anxiety but on the 3 day of taking I had some psychosis related side effects in aggravation then started to get very hyper but depressed bad experience,3,36
BuSpar,"I connect so much with Frustrated Fenway Fan's post..I have almost disabling anxiety. I started having panic attacks at eleven years old.....I am now 33. The entire time I was treated with Xanax which I NEVER once abused...my former doctor abruptly stopped prescribing it to me because he caught wind that I had spent a year and a half fighting an opiate addiction, Suboxone saved my life...but although that is all in the past and I don't even take that medication anymore....it is on my medical history! Now.NO ONE will prescribe me any sort of benzodiazepine. I have just been prescribed Buspar. I pray it works. I just want my life back.",5,41
BuSpar,"BEST medication I've ever taken for anxiety. I was skeptical to take it because of some negative reviews, but I figured, what the heck, what have I got to lose??   I plan on staying on buspar for a long long time. It's allowed me to be more outgoing and get involved more in social situations. Have a positive attitude, try it, and I think you'll love it too!",10,151
BuSpar,I have tried many other anxiety medications. This took about 4 weeks to work but is great. I'm 34 years old and have had anxiety since I was a teenager. This is the best I have felt in my adult life. Also taking Prozac once daily. Great combination.,10,53
BuSpar,"So, Buspar does nothing for me at all. I may as well have been taking a sugar pill all this time. My doctor felt that since I was only 30 years old, the Benzo that I had been on for the last 4 years that greatly helped me, was out of the question because SOME folks abuse it. REALLY?! If your anxiety is intense and life ruling like mine is, please look into a Benzo. Hopefully you'll have a doctor that is actually out to HELP you.",1,44
BuSpar,"Buspar 5 mg twice daily for possible anxiety induced difficulty failing asleep. First week good, second week less helpful for sleep, then onset of extreme hip, bilateral leg weakness with feeling of extreme leg muscle fatigue, start mid afternoon, worse by bedtime every night, required pain med to allow sleep. Discontinued.",2,25
BuSpar,"My doctor first started me on buspar over two years ago, probably at 16. Slowly throughout the years we've had to increase it until about a year ago, when I reached the maximum 60mg and I had to finally ask my doctor for something else. But I mean that's what you get with medication, it's all pretty much trial and error",2,23
BuSpar,"I've had severe anxiety and depression for many years and have tried many meds. For me, BuSpar wasn't very effective, even at the maximum dose of 60mg/day. It also caused me very restless legs at night, which was extremely troublesome. I couldn't lie still for even ten seconds. I also got brain zaps. My doctor thinks I should remain on BuSpar, so these days I take only 10mg/day as a backup to my other meds. I don't have the side effects at the lower dose.",5,29
BuSpar,"I started this medication on a low, as needed, 5mg dose back in August after I started a new job with a high level of stress. Taking it twice a day as needed worked for awhile with no major side effects. Working this stressful job full time, classes, and being a newly wed young adult was taking it's toll and I finally had a nervous breakdown at work, uncontrollable sobbing, hyperventilating, the works. I went to the doctor and we've upped it from 5mg BID PRN to 15mg twice daily. I'm currently taking 7.5mg twice daily to get used to the increased dose. The only side effects I'm dealing with is nausea, but it goes away eventually.",7,36
BuSpar,Takes 6-8 weeks to work but it works better than anything I've tried. I've had anxiety for years and have tried a long list of meds.,10,62
BuSpar,"I was on this back in the 80's while hospitalized for depression. It was a  horrible drug it made my mouth dry and talking difficult. Also, it must have made me say things I don't recall saying because during one appointment with the psychiatrist in the hospital, he wrote a comments he thought I said which I hadn't (I later saw the reports)!",1,14
BuSpar,Wait 6 weeks but it helps before then too. I have been on it at 25 mg a day for a year.  Just recently I have been in a traumatic situation and I ramped up the dosage to 40/50 mg to help. It has been a huge help and I only have taken 2 Ativan during this three week ordeal. I think Buspar for me makes me tired when I am not anxious and is a huge help when I am. It seems to cut the adrenaline levels and that is what works for me without the sexual side effects that SSRIs have.,10,53
BuSpar,"After extreme weight gain on SSRIs, I thought buspar would be my miracle drug. I was totally wrong. After day two I had such bad twitches/tremors and my jaw seemed to locked for short periods of time. Went to emergency due to the side effects causing panic attacks.",1,38
BuSpar,"I've been on this medication for 8 months now &amp; really like it.  I take a combination of Buspirone &amp; Mirtazapine which keeps me level with no anxiety.  My racing thoughts are gone.  I was waking up all night every hour with racing thoughts.  Now I'm able to sleep &amp; have a calm mind both while waking &amp; sleeping.  One thing I do notice is that it gives me the munchies for sweets.  I'm working to curb that with healthy snacks instead.  Sometimes it does make me slightly light headed, but to me that's a relaxing feeling that helps me stay calm.  I'm able to stay focused and am doing better on my job &amp; in my personal life than ever before.  I really love this medication &amp; give it a thumbs up for anxiety!",10,100
BuSpar,"I started taking Busbar earlier this year. I'm unable to work due to severe depression, severe anxiety, and PTSD.  Initially, it eased my muscles and eased my anxiety better than xanax. Since I have been on it, my face is fat and I've gained weight in places where I have never had a problem.  My formerly long thick hair is thin.  My skin became thin and dry.  At one point, I had patches of hair missing; through prayer, it's coming back. Today I was so disgusted with the changes and prayed for a reason as to why these things were happening.It came to me to look up the side effects of busbar and BAM, they were all there.   Warning this stuff can cause alopecia.  I'm going to stop taking it.",2,53
BuSpar,"Noticed a change immediately.  Started out on 5mg twice a day for two weeks, then upped to 10mg twice a day.  Work in surgery so pretty stressful work.  I couldnt sleep the night before cases thinking about all the bad things that could happen.  Once I started taking buspar those thoughts went away and I could get a full nights rest.  I am clear headed and focused at work, whenever negative thoughts creep in my head I am able to dispel them with relative ease.",10,83
BuSpar,I was put om buspar due to getting custody of my niece and nephew from dhr and getting a promotion to a new much more stressful job. The buspar helped keep me calm enough to focus at the tasks before me and help me get through my day to day life. I was super stressed and scared bc of all of the changes in my life and buspar helped me calm down and cope,10,71
BuSpar,"I started taking this medication during a particularly stressful period in my life and continued it for about a year.  It got me through a divorce and kept me within my stress threshold.  I stopped taking it when I started feeling like I was on stable ground and had little if any withdrawal symptoms.  After about a year, another stressful situation came up with my little sister tried to kill herself and I was in my first semester back to college with a full course load, trying to be a single mom to the best of my ability at the same time.  It definitely doesn't work as strongly as it did the first round, but it makes the stress level manageable.  It feels like he rock sitting on my chest has been removed, and then I can think through things",8,67
BuSpar,"This is the first anxiety medicine I have ever been on, and it is by far the worst experience ever. My moods are anxious, depressed, and irritable. At first, I thought I was just overwhelmed with school and work, after reading some other reviews, I realized it's the Buspar doing it to me. If I take one due to an anxiety attack, about an hour later I am crying and talking about how much I hate myself, then about 30 minutes after that stops, I get extremely irritable and everything makes me mad. I've quit taking it until my follow up appointment and I can get it changed. I will never try this again.",1,30
BuSpar,If I could rate a 0 I would. While I was on it for only 4 weeks I became extremely irritable and was constantly hating myself. Worst meds I've ever been on and I've tried a lot.,1,24
BuSpar,"Started taking Buspar to cope with the increased anxiety that Welbutrin gave me. I eventually got off Welbutrin because of the awful side effects, but stayed on the Buspar. It definitely helps to relax me mentally. I feel physically relaxed too, and my anxious habits such as bouncing my leg and drumming my fingers have been reduced, plus some of the racing thoughts and constant worrying have been dulled (although not completely cured.) The only side effect so far has been slight dizziness at times  and I feel slightly less coordinated at times. This hasn't been a deal breaker at all, however, and I'm sure these symptoms will go away with time. I'd recommend this for mild anxiety.",9,44
BuSpar,"Hello all! I took this medication for around two months, and it helped with my anxiety, but caused me to become apathetic. I simply couldn't be bothered to do anything! It was horrible!",5,17
BuSpar,"My dr added buspar twice a day while on lexapro already. Took for about a week. Every time I took it about an hour later all I wanted to do was kill myself. It would go away for a while and then once I took it again, the same feelings came back. Took it for about a week and stopped after I couldn't take the feelings anymore. Feelings stopped immediately. Would never try this again.",1,28
BuSpar,I love this med no side effects no problems at all just stopped my massive anxiety problems I was having almost weekly and I mean want to run to get out of my skin anxiety.. Panic attacks to the max,10,100
BuSpar,"I took BuSpar for a few days for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but it cause a tic in my eye. My eyelid would flicker uncontrollably every once in a while. Apparently this is pretty serious, and can actually be permanent even after ending the medication, which was very scary. Luckily for me, the tic went away when I stopped taking it.",1,26
BuSpar,"I have GAD, and after three years of taking care of  my younger brother who has severe GAD  as well as going through an episode of pyschosis, I was told by my pdoc that I have caregiver's burnout. I was prescribed 20 mgs of Paxil every day and 15mg of Buspirone (Buspar) twice a day. It has been nearly a month now on these meds and I do see an improvement. I'm not sure which one is helping me more but my anxiety level has gone from an 8 or 9 every day to about a 5. I hope to see continued improvement.",9,45
BuSpar,"After my first dose on Sunday, I had a terrible migraine. I decided to take it once a day at night until I get used to it. I took it at night instead of taking it at the beginning of my 12 hour shifts (I'm a nurse). Yesterday was my first day of taking it twice a day as prescribed. I took the second dose at 10 PM. I woke up at 2 AM this morning with extreme dizziness and a profusely bleeding nose. I thought I was dizzy because of my allergy meds and being sleepy and I explained the bloody nose as being related to allergies. I went to work again today after taking my morning dose at 6 AM. At 10 AM I once again had a bleeding nose. I checked my blood pressure, and it was in the 150s when it normal runs less than 100. Will never take again",1,32
BuSpar,I have been taking Buspar and Celexa and as far as the anxiety it has helped me a lot..I was having bad heart palpitations and it's gone..no more headaches either..what I did was I started talking Celexa at night and I take Buspar 2-3 times a day.  I can't say I'm completely ok because the Celexa needs to be in your system at least 6-8 weeks before you start feeling better....I'm feeling a little better. And not having Anxiety truly helps. I'm still haven't been able to go to work because of how scared I am to get an anxiety attack but I'm already starting to consider it. Believe me when I tell you I was on the verge of being committed...give it a chance not all our systems are the same. Good luck,10,62
BuSpar,"So I have read several posts and here is my response. This is my second time on Buspar and I was prescribed 7.5. I didn't like the dizzy feeling and I had trouble focusing so I cut my dose in half. Broke the pills. After very light dizziness with the 3.1 dose I am feeling good. I know the doctor prescribed one dosage but if you continue to feel sick after a few days just lower your dose and start from there. You're going to feel weird for the first few days anyways as your body adjusts. The Meds work great. In the beginning when I was getting upset I could feel the medicine trigger something to keep me calm. The more I tried to get upset or was experiencing anxiety, the more weird I felt it's been 2 weeks now..",8,63
BuSpar,"I take Buspar 5mg twice a day for anxiety. After a week, I will then take Buspar 10mg twice a day. I have only been taking it 4 days now. I also take Paxil 50 mg daily and Adderall 10 mg twice daily. So far I have had no side effects from the Buspar except slight dizziness and lack of appetite. So far those are tolerable.",6,30
BuSpar,I have really bad anxiety and I've pretty much tried everything. I take kaldopins for panic attacks and they work but I needed something for daily issues. This medicine really worked but omg I can't handle the side effects. Everyday I have a migraine or I'm nauseous or puking.,5,22
BuSpar,Take only as necessary. 2.5 mg- 5mg. only when necessary. Been taking for years when I feel nervous and have a tension headache. Works great to relax me. 30-10 mg pills can last a year for me,10,65
BuSpar,"Took this medication for a few months after being diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. It did work fairly well in decreasing my symptoms of anxiety, but the side effects were just too much to handle. The first time I took it (my doc prescribed me a low dose, I think it was 5mg if I remember right) I was knocked out in about 30 minutes and slept for 5 hours straight, not to mention this was in the middle of the day. Also caused extreme dizziness that I had a hard time functioning with. I thought the drowsiness, dizziness, and weakness that it caused might subside after taking it for awhile, but I took it for about three months and these side effects still persisted.",5,45
BuSpar,"I am new to the anxiety realm, and have already tried a few different meds (xanax, ativan, buspar) and so far buspar has shown the most promise. However, even on buspar I still experience sporadic chest pressure, sharp pains in the chest, brain buzz, and muscle twitches. Today the chest issues were so bad that I had to take a xanax. I am typically against prescribed meds, and this is really the first time in my life taking them. The side effects and other dangers scare the crap out of me, but I need to figure out how to subdue my anxiety. Does anyone have any suggestions?",5,45
BuSpar,"I did not like this medication. For anxiety, I have also tried Hydroxyzine (Atarax). I guess this is just my personal body chemistry but I actually prefer Atarax to this unlike most people. This made me VERY lightheaded and dizzy. I can't exactly remember the effect it had on anxiety, I think it may have helped a little.",4,19
BuSpar,"I have been recently prescribed Buspar and Celexa for anxiety. I decided to take just the Buspar and not the Celexa because of a past experience with an anti-depressant. Has anyone just used Buspar with another medication, if so how did it work? Another question is, after taking Buspar for a while  did you find  you didn't need Buspar anymore and no more anxiety or medication?",0,19
BuSpar,I too have been experiencing dramatic weight loss with buspar. Just read the last comment and pretty much spot on. I don't get hungry anymore. I'm a 5'7 female who weighed 175lbs. and now I'm down to 120lbs. After two   months of this medicine. Also I noticed I seem to be having some severe OCD thoughts while taking this medicine. In the beginning it was all smooth sailing and now it seems like it's not working. Going to try another medicine.,6,46
BuSpar,"I was not able to function on this medication. I took one half of my pill as directed. 30 mins later I was hot, felt sick, everything irritated me. I was dizzy. I had to lay on my couch for 3 hours. I will never take this again.",1,27
BuSpar,"I have looked up the research regarding weight loss or loss of appetite while on Buspar and it seems as though more people gain weight or have an increased appetite.  Has anyone experienced weight loss or loss of appetite?  Maybe it's nausea (though I don't necessarily feel 'nauseous') but I have no appetite - at all.  As far as the effectiveness on my anxiety - I feel good, almost 'normal', if you will.  Nothing like taking Buspar for anxiety (mostly health anxiety) to have it make me think sometime is wrong because I have no appetite. However, the thought of 'something is wrong' is fleeting since Buspar. Wondering if anyone has had loss of appetite or weight loss.  -Hoping you have an anxiety-free day",8,47
BuSpar,"I'm 15 years old and before being on this I was a MESS. I was so anxious all the time I left school and it was just so bad I didn't hang out with friends for months but after being on it I can't even begin to explain how great I feel. I never feel nervous or anxious for ANYTHING I'm back at school , going to football games , hanging with friends everyday , and making new ones . This is the BEST. I have felt in so so long , probably ever! I'm so thankful for this medication ! It takes about 3 months for it to actually work but I HIGHLY suggest it!!!!!",8,105
BuSpar,Hey I was on Buspirone and it didn't seem to work and all I did was cut out my friends and act like a loser.,5,17
BuSpar,"I developed depression and anxiety after my divorce 11 years ago.  It comes and goes but normally some stress or change in my life can trigger it.  Sometimes it is mild, and sometimes it pretty tough to deal with.  I exercise a lot, try to eat healthy, keep booze to a minimum but it can be hard to shake.  I have tried several anti-depressant's over the without much luck.  Even though anxiety and depression tend to go hand in hand, I find anxiety to be harder to deal with. Anyway... My doctor recently suggest that I try BusPar.  I read up on it and thought why not?  It has only been a week (and I know it can take weeks to take effect), but I seem to be seeing some improvement.  I am not as consumed with anxiety as a week ago.",8,87
BuSpar,"Have been on a few SSRIs (Paxil, Lexapro, and Zoloft).  Zoloft pulled me out of a dark hole of severe anxiety and insomnia and kept my head above water for about a year but I never felt great on it, just able to cope with life plus I still needed ativan for sleep which I didn't like but it helped.  Decided to try Buspar.  Wad fairly easy to get on, minimal side effects, a lot of brain zaps, though.  Mood improved after about 2 weeks, for about a week, then it just stopped working and anxiety came back hard.  Also I had bad insomnia the whole time on it, even before, but this didn't help in any way.  Had pretty disturbing nightmares when I did sleep.  Insomnia and decline in mood forced me to get off.  Took for a month.  Was at 30mg 3 x day.",3,29
BuSpar,"Okay so buspar was the first medicine I took and it helped with my anxiety tremendously but the side effects sucked. I'm a female and only weigh about 115 so I'm not sure if that's why the side effects impacted me so much or what. The first day I was on it, I was fine. The only problem was I felt a little dizzy after the first 10 min of taking it but then I was fine and I would go about my regular day and I felt amazing. I took this pill everyday for about 4 days and felt fine but then one day after I took it, I was so dizzy, I could barely stand up and then I felt nauseous all day long. It was not fun. So it's kind of a hit or miss with this medicine. You either take it and feel fine or you'll have bad side effects. At least for me anyways",4,40
BuSpar,"I was taking Buspar along with Proactive and Xanax for 5 years...I felt great, so I stopped the Buspar.  Within the last 2 months I have had to completely detox off Xanax, and it was a nightmare, I hope to never feel that way again...long story short, I'm back on my Buspar along side my Prozac and I can't remember feeling this good...The fog has lifted! !! My anxiety is all but nothing....I have never had side effects from Buspar either, and I take 15mgs twice a day. For those of you that have an anxiety disorder, this medication is definitely worth trying because you can cope so much better without all the hazy side effects from benzos. BEST OF LUCK!",10,171
BuSpar,"Buspar has changed my life! I absolutely love this medication. I suffer from phobias and health anxiety and this medication has worked wonders for me. As a nurse, I didn't want anything addictive and this was my miracle. I tried Ativan and it didn't even touch my anxiety. I have had no side effects with the Buspar and it has helped me to relax and feel like myself again! I highly recommend it!",9,208
BuSpar,"I was prescribed Buspar a few months ago after consistent failures with various benzos. I took 10mg x day for a while and felt nothing, went up to 20mg x day and kind of felt something, and basically I am now on 40mg x day and I can finally feel it working. It has helped significantly with my anxiety and has relieved the sexual side effects from Prozac. I take my second dose of the day at night with my Trazodone, and it has completely eradicated my fluctuating tolerancy issues with the Trazodone. I never got the brain zaps, but I occasionally get long-lasting headaches, bouts of anger, and fairly awful nightmares. Other than that, it has helped with my GAD quite a bit and is generally more helpful than not.",8,78
BuSpar,Been on Buspar for 6 weeks and I'm not feeling any better. My anxiety is mild compared to most but the irritability and sometimes nervous feeling is why I elected to try Buspar. So far at  6 weeks I haven't felt any benefits. The dizziness has been hard to deal with although I found some relief with 25 - 50 mg. Dramamine.,1,49
BuSpar,My son is in high school and has taken this for 7 months. It changed his life. His anxiety over school was out of control to the point he had to be inter graded back into school. He tried Ativan and had horrible side effects and he was reluctant to try anything else after that. After about 3 months on the Buspar he walks tall into school. No more looking over his shoulder or panic attacks out to f nowhere. We wish he would've taken this years ago. The only side effect he complains of is tiredness and occasional headache. The tiredness was more so in the beginning. Those side effects are minuscule compared to his anxiety before taking Buspar.,9,118
BuSpar,No help with anxiety,1,12
BuSpar,I was only on this for a few days until I got a tick inm y left eye and my doctor said I had to discontinue. Research indicates that in rare cases these facial ticks could be permanent which is scary. I also experienced brain shocks/zaps.,1,43
BuSpar,"First off. Side effects.... Brain zaps. Pounding heart, foggy feeling. First 3 weeks I felt the need for a lot less Ativan. The worry stopped and blood pressure came down . I'm on 5mg per day. Around week 5 I started to notice my blood pressure going back up. Acid reflux and a little nausea. Pounding heart back. I don't want to give up on buspar because I was so happy to lose the everyday worry. On week 7 now. Still at 5mg. Thinking about doing 5mg twice a day. There is no magic pill, but this was close.",8,83
BuSpar,"In a nutshell, even though I did not want this drug to work because I hate taking medicine, it really does help me! I refuse to take benzos. My therapist talked me into trying buspar. It made me really tired at first. But honestly, now that I look back, I think it did that because it seemed to slow my racing mind down. So naturally, once I relaxed a bit more, my body finally could rest. My anxiety is not gone. But when I am in a place where I feel safe, I am able to relax and my mind isn't so noisy. It is a strange, new feeling.",8,125
BuSpar,"I suffer from sever depression, severe anxiety, sever pain due to several other medical conditions and life itself. Been taking this for about 3 months and things are a lot less stressful. I can handle light social situations again. Im actually able to sleep all night again. This combined with my fleet of other meds I'm able to function a lot more. Ive been on the usual xanax and what not, those were fun but long term didn't work for me (i grew up yay) Need more meds like this on the market.",10,82
BuSpar,I've been on this medicine for about 7 months. I started at 5 mg and I felt great! But around the 4 months I got worse and ended up increasing my dose to 30 mg and now I feel even more better then before! The only side effect I experienced was a slight brain zaps but they go away after a week or two. This medicine has helped me so much I recommend this medcine!,9,116
BuSpar,"I am 44 years old and have suffered from general and social anxiety as long as can remember and have used many drugs through the years. I am currently on remeron, wellbutrin and buspar. I take 10mg of buspar 3 times a day and it has a subtle calming effect on the mind and body. If you are looking for a drug that will let you forget you have anxiety, buspar is not for you. If you are looking for a drug that is non habit forming, that has a low side effect profile, has no withdrawal issues and will help you manage your anxiety than buspar is you you. Good luck.",7,80
BuSpar,"So far it hasn't helped much with the anxiety... it's actually made it worse. My hands tremble and I feel like I'm walking on the deck of a moving ship. Making an appointment with my doctor to discontinue and find a new med, as this one is freaking me out.",1,67
BuSpar,"I've only been taking Buspar for a few days, and I haven't noticed any anxiety.  But the side effects make me sick as, but are temporarily, and I think mine are magnified because I'm on so many medications.  So far it works and is also used for sex dysfunction, which has helped my sex life with my partner.  To each their own.  Definitely do not drive on this medication.",8,58
BuSpar,PTSD. Seemed to help some. Have bit of dizzy loopy for about 15 to 30 minutes after taking then ok. Was taking other meds and got sick and barfed often. Quit taking and nausea stopped. After a couple of months feeling quite anxious so started up Buspar again and anxiety seems to be very much calmed down. I plan to space meds out throughout day and find a schedule where my tummy doesn't feel so nauseated.,8,25
BuSpar,"I started on Effexor, that medicine made me sick, and nauseated. My Dr decided to put me on Buspar instead. This medicine made my anxiety so much better! And the side effects are very minimal, I only get a little light headed for a short time, but that's so much better than being sick to my stomach. This stuff has really helped me get through a rough time.",9,163
BuSpar,Besides getting dizzy haven't noticed any effect.,2,46
BuSpar,"Been on BuSpar over a month and it does not help me at all, actually makes my anxiety worse and I have been much more irritable. Can't wait to try something else. I have also gained 5 pounds in the short time I have been on it. That adds to my anxiety.",1,76
BuSpar,"The best medication I've taken thus far for anxiety. I'm on 60 mg/day split into two doses of 30. Non addicting, no sexual side effects, in fact this is amazingly free of any side effects that I have experienced. I have been on Klonopin in the past and overall I have to say that this has been the best for my anxiety and social phobia. The medical community is all too quick to disregard this medicine as ineffective. Its a safe medicine. You're not losing anything by at least giving it a trial. Its the only med that's worked well for me after trying countless SSRIs, and a few psych meds of other classes. Good luck.",9,174
BuSpar,"I have been on this medication for 3 years now - I think I need to up the dose because it is not working that well however it saved my butt a few years ago when something traumatic happened. My dr told me take it and give it 6 weeks and then all the panic and anxiety stopped- it's everything from hypochondriac to 24 hour a day worry about job, health, kids and everything else- I do think it is a lifesaver - I went from 5mg 3x a day to 2 5mg 2x a day - maybe I should go back.",8,90
BuSpar,I've been taking 15 mg 2x/day with good results.  My social anxiety has improved and I am sleeping much better.  I have been taking Ambien almost every night for the past 4 years and now down to less than 1x/week.  That to me has made it worth it.,9,119
BuSpar,"I'm on week 7, I thought would wait until the effects kicked in to write a review. Regarding the side effects, mild nausea and lethargy for a short while after taking the medication, nothing to avoid taking the pill for. As for the results, very mild, but I notice a difference.  I speak more clearly and confident to people and I overall am less anxious. One big thing,  my constant worry about my health has subsided. I am 31 and live a healthy life bit I get a stomach ache and think I have colon cancer. These thoughts I laugh at now. I recommend taking this. Only 8 stars because it is not a cure all, only you can be.",8,294
BuSpar,"I've been taking Buspar for a month, following a period of elevating anxiety that was turning my life into a joyless state of constant worry and anxious, obsessive, unhelpful thoughts.  My psychiatrist warned it would take 4-6 weeks to notice any improvement - I noticed significant improvement within *hours* of pill #1 with minor and bearable side effects.  At other low periods, I was medicated for depression without benefit, and sometimes terrible side effects (Prozac: auditory hallucinations; Celexa: crazy hot flashes). Unfortunately I seem to be noticing decreasing benefit. I have been taking just 7.5 mg/day so today I doubled to the full 15mg I was prescribed.  Hope it works!  This medicine has given me real hope.",8,104
BuSpar,"I started taking Buspar about a year ago for anxiety/panic attacks. I've taken benzodiazepines in the past but having an addictive personality, I had to stop those. Buspar saved my life. I have no fear, paranoia, or low self esteem anymore. I used to feel like the world was out to get me and that I was being judged by everyone no matter where I went. I used to have the most crippling social anxiety too, I'd avoid social situations because the anxiety was so bad. Luckily Buspar erased all of that for me. Anxiety still creeps up here and then but it is absolutely nowhere close to being as bad as it was before. No side effects. I love it and will take it for a long time. At first I did get headaches but they went away a couple days later. Love it.",10,264
BuSpar,I was prescribed benzodiazepine for my post traumatic stress disorder induced anxiety. The benzos worked great for me but after admitting myself into a rehab program for substance abuse I was told I could no longer take the benzos as there is high risk for abuse and addiction (even though this wasn't the medicine I was abusing). After a number of panic attacks I sought help from the doctor for a non-addictive alternative. They gave me Buspar 10mg 3x a day. This improved my anxiety but I still had days that were debilitating. I saw the doctor again and he upped the does to 15mg 3x a day and I have been completely anxiety free since. Make sure you have the proper dosage before claiming this doesn't work. And the side effects like dizziness are easily countered with a good meal.,10,250
BuSpar,I have been taking Buspar for 2 months and have definitely noticed I am more relaxed and less reactive and upset in stressful situations. Prior to Buspar I had taken Xanax as needed for anxiety but it made me extremely hungry I would eat so much (and even worse-not remember) that it just gave me more anxiety from all the weight gain. I am only taking Buspar now and I take 7.5 mg x 3 daily. I am able to function on this medication and not feel like a zombie. I feel very relaxed and I am starting to enjoy life!,8,236
BuSpar,I'm a 17 year old female. I have OCD and anxiety and this has done nothing for me! I take 7.5 mg 3 x a day and I wish I could take something else. I've been out of school for like a month because of my anxiety.,1,41
BuSpar,"I was having ALL kinds of medical problems, severe cramps, inability to urinate, severe joint pain, headaches, insomnia, and more. I noticed an improvement immediately, most of my problems went away completely, and my joint pain subsided some. I've been on it for two months now, I feel happy, calm and 10Xs better all over. Generalized Anxiety Disorder is a terrible thing to TRY and live with, Buspar is the answer. I had tried lots of natural remedies, like 5HTP and many others. The natural supplements had far more side effects than Buspar! I hate taking medication, but I'm not sure how I'd get along without it.  Buspar has changed my life. I'm not sure what started the severe anxiety because I have never had a problem with it, but whatever it was Buspar saved me.",10,328
BuSpar,"I take between 30-50 mg per day depending on how I feel. Usually 15mg or 20mg at a time. Doctors should really look at this medicine for bipolar as I am severely bipolar (with anxiety) and do not like addictive substances. Buspar is a wonder medicine for some! I'm getting my life back! I no longer rage and ruminate, and I can also sleep, and think more clearly :D most things do not work for me but this one did.",10,279
BuSpar,"I tried this after going off Cymbalta cold turkey since I felt that Cymbalta was doing basically nothing for me and worse yet - making me clench my teeth so badly I was getting regular migraines from the TMJ I was getting! Wish the heck I had known Cymbalta had the less common side effect of clenching and I could have saved myself a ton I agony, massage therapy, CHIRO visits and muscle relaxers! Anyway as for Buspirone - took between 10 mg and 15 mg 2x day for nearly a whole month and it did virtually nothing for my anxiety! This was especially bad because Cymbalta's withdrawal is horrible and I was experiencing extreme irritability, anger etc. I asked for Prozac 10 mg yesterday and feel 85% better already!",2,52
BuSpar,"I have generalized anxiety, few panic attacks ever, mostly just obsessive irrational thoughts and constant fears which aren't normal. This definitely helps me calm down and keeps my brain quiet when it normally never stops. For about 2 weeks I would get spouts of dizziness, along with a feeling of restlessness and an inability to focus (felt very much like ADD) but it has been going away! This medicine helps for general anxiety, but I don't think it would do much for panic. I take 5mg 3x a day.",10,176
BuSpar,"I am 23 years old and suffer from generalized anxiety disorder. I did not want to be on an addictive med, and was very adamant about that with my doctor. I was prescribed Buspar and have been taking it for a year now (10mg 3 times a day) and it seems to work quite well. It calms me down and makes me think more rationally rather than experiencing constant worry and fear. I feel more free and open to life. Side effects I've experienced include dizziness, hot flashes and extreme hunger for about an hour after taking it. Taking it with food in your stomach is a must as it decreases the side effects for me. One complaint though, is short term memory problems and cloudy mind effect, but I will take that any day over my anxiety!",8,184
BuSpar,This medicine started to wear off I think due to too many negatives over 1 month time and I was upped on my dosage from 20mg x2 daily to 40mg x2 daily 8 days ago for thoughts not right and anxiety plus depression. Everything is starting to lift finally and feeling great and happy. It was really tough 8 days so far with very LOW LOWS and I'm BEYOND happy with it. LIFE SAVER INDEED.,10,184
BuSpar,"I have suffered from generalized anxiety disorder for longer than I care to remember.  Went through too many anti-depressants that all failed.  I was told the Buspar was an oldie but goodie.  I was reluctant to even try another pill and was of the notion that drinking wine was going to be my alternate choice, (which I didn't care to start).  Buspar has been my answer.  It's brought calm into my life.  I recommend this magic pill.",9,280
BuSpar,I suffer from severe panic attacks. This medicine left me on the couch for a week because I felt so dizzy. My vision is also snowy from this medication and still has not went away 2 years later.,1,51
BuSpar,"I just started taking buspar and at first I was scared because I hate bad side effects and don't like to take pills at all so I finally took my pill 10mg I felt good at first then came the side effects lightheaded sweating and dizziness but after 20 to 30 mins later it was over. I felt fine went out to socialize and I couldn't believe it, didn't have a panic attack or anxiety attack they work for me.",8,184
BuSpar,"I've had generalized anxiety disorder since before they knew what it was.  I have been in all SSRIs, the side effects have kept me from being on them long enough to see if they worked, then Ativan through clonazepam, still anxiety ridden, as a last chance medicine, my Dr gave me Buspar, at this point I was beyond jaded and thought oh great another pill that won't work, but it did, at 30mgs split to 10mgs 3 times daily.  I felt the cloud of anxiety lift after the first pill.  I stopped catastrophisizing everything and got my life back. It is an older medicine, no longer a 'go to' medicine, but should be, the others made me zombie like etc.  I had the dizzies for a week, pushed through, they stopped.  I am now so incredibly happy and anxiety free.",10,288
BuSpar,"I take Lexapro 20mg once daily and 5mg (for now) three times daily. The first week I didn't notice much at all.. But now that I've been taking it for over a week I am starting to notice it's effects. Most notably when I let it dissolve under my tongue. This medication has no notable side effects. Only downside is its mildly underpowered. To me, Lexapro is the work horse, and Buspar is a helper.",6,52
BuSpar,"This medication caused me severe, episodic dizziness.",1,47
BuSpar,"About 3 months ago out of no where I had a severe panic attack and was rushed to hospital thinking it was a heart attack which it was not but the next day I woke up with severe anxiety, it was horrible. I tried natural remedies but nothing worked and was afraid of SSRIs because of the side effects, after some research I asked to try Buspar,  it took over 2 months and playing with the dosage, I take 10 mg morning, 7.5mg afternoon and night time. I finally feel like the constant dialogue in my head is settled down to a point where I can function,  hoping it just gets better from here on in. I have had no side effects at all,  it may take a while for this medicine to work but stick with it. I think it's worth it.",8,169
BuSpar,I was told that it may take a while to build in the system to work. I took it for over 2 months. As far as treating anxiety it didn't work.,1,55
BuSpar,"This panic attacks all hit me in August, it was December before they figured out it was anxiety because I had other medical stuff, wrong sickness. They started me out on Zoloft I was allergic then some other meds that had bad side effects finally my doctors try me out on Buspar. Finally after weeks getting the right dosage I have been awesome and healthy for over a month. This pill has given my life back, I was so bad I couldn't go in stores. Now I go every day and shop. This pill is awesome, it takes over a month to get build up or did for me. It was worth the wait, I feel so good I stopped it for 4 days I had panic attack then went back on and I plan on taking this.",10,201
BuSpar,I've only been taking Buspar for 3 weeks and my anxiety is gone but I'm still depressed and irritable.,6,103
BuSpar,"Buspar changed my life, no kidding. I have been on Prozac so long, but once Buspar was added my personality came to life. Not that I don't sometimes worry, but it is sooo much better to manage with the Buspar. I am not any kind of spokesperson. I have a friend who it didn't work for, but for me, it has changed my life.",10,206
BuSpar,"I don't like SSRIs. The fact that Buspar can deal with serotonin receptors without causing the loss of libido, weight gain, and tiredness makes it perfect to treat generalized anxiety. Plus it's non-addictive like many benzodiazepine for panic attacks. I wish they made it in extended release form, though my doctor said it's okay to just take my full dose in the morning - and that seems to be working fine for me. It's the only medication that focuses mainly on the brain's serotonin levels that I like.",8,211
BuSpar,"Did experience slight positive changes, but came at a cost of constant dizziness and fainting",1,50
BuSpar,CHANGED me life for the BETTER! Took a little while to kick in. Better to be on this then a habit-forming or dependent medicine..you have to want to change and then this medicine will work. Life-saver! 10mg once a day for 6 months now.,10,191
BuSpar,This medicine has worked wonders for me... took a month to work but well worth the wait.,9,140
BuSpar,"I have generalized anxiety and panic disorder, I have since I was a teenager. In the past, I took Xanax as needed but it sometimes made me depressed and I worried about developing a tolerance or addiction. After less than a month on Buspar, I have already seen a major improvement. I ruminate less, my body is less tense, I am considerably less fearful (which is saying a lot because I was becoming fearful of leaving the house), I am able to tolerate stressors in a rational way, I am no longer depressed. What remains of my anxiety is manageable and it no longer interferes with my life. I began on 10mg and after a couple weeks bumped up to 15mg. I experienced insomnia the first couple days but that went away. Take with food for nausea.",9,216
BuSpar,"I found that it worked better for me than anything else. After taking it for about 8 weeks, I was able to ween myself off of every other medication. This was the miracle for me.",10,179
BuSpar,"Buspar has completely and utterly changed my life. I have struggled with generalized anxiety ever since I was a child, and I've never been able to find a permanent solution. I have taken Xanax and Klonopin, but those are short-acting, and you build resistance to them quickly, and they're habit-forming. Now that I'm on Buspar, I have no anxiety. None. Nada. Zip. No more butterflies in my stomach, no more hyperventilating, no more irrational thoughts. I can fall asleep at night no problem, and wake up in the morning and be excited about my day. It takes a while to start noticing (3 weeks for me), but it's completely worth the wait. I'm finally excited about my future, and I finally feel in control of my life.",10,381
BuSpar,"This replaced Benzosiazepines and Sleeping pills, gives better rest, improved sex drive, decidedly improved social life. I'm 46m, prescribed 15mg x2 daily. Others noted the improvements first. I had no untoward side effects other than dry mouth and a few lingering panic attacks per month easily handed by low dose Xanax 0.5 mg. Various SSRI's along the way didn't help with depression this much. 5 years running. It works good.",9,146
BuSpar,I am 29 years old and have been on Buspar for about a year and a half and since I started taking it my sex drive is completely gone. Yes it helps my anxiety but I am too young to have a horrible sex drive!,6,48
BuSpar,"I have suffered from severe anxiety for about 3 years now. I've tried buspar for a little bit and it helped some but I didn't keep taking it. I just had to post what has taken 90% of my anxiety away and that's cardio exercise daily. I started going to the gym and riding the bike with the heart beat monitor on it.  I got my heart beat to 120 beats per minute and held it there til I got tired, then slowed down to rest a couple minutes then speed up again.. I'm a crane operator and mostly sit all day in my crane. The very first day I sustained a higher heart rate by exercising for 15 minutes my anxiety levels plummeted. Every day after that it has gotten better. Before taking drugs for anxiety try fast walking for 15 minutes. It will help!",6,145
BuSpar,"My psychiatrist put me on buspar after i had tried lexapro &amp; many natural remedies in regards to my anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, &amp; PTSD. Personally, i think that the medication fools with my depression. My depression has been inactive for almost 6 months now &amp; so i requested ( after taking the lexapro ) that i could be put on strictly anxiety medication. I also have adhd, which i have been taking concerta for. When taking buspar i realized that, it increases my concerta side effects, makes me have depressive symptoms. I feel like it makes me have the physical effects of everything but not the actual feelings, which is frusturating because when presented it looks like more anxiety, depression, adhd, ptsd.. etc. symptoms.",5,36
BuSpar,"My son timed it several times without me knowing and discovered in 10 mins I was doing so much better, in 20 I was completely back!",10,95
BuSpar,I have Schizoaffective disorder with bipolar features as well as uncontrollable anxiety. This medicine has helped me tremendously! I take 5mg in the morning and 15mg at night so I can fall asleep. I would recommend this medicine for sure!,10,102
BuSpar,"I have Cluster Migraines so the doctor put me on Topamax, after about 2 months I developed anxiety symptoms and a rather hateful personality so they added Buspar to take  the edge off. It has worked well for me but I can tell when it wears off. I'm on a low dose so it just may be time to adjust( 5mg twice a day ). All in all very satisfied with this medicine. It does make you dream vividly but that doesn't bother me.",9,88
BuSpar,"Took 5mg. Dizziness after I initially started taking, that vanished but occasionally cropped up once in a while. Felt pretty good. Happier. Thoughts that I would normally worry about still came to me, but I was able to think about them and dismiss them, not obsess over them ALL day. Some months later though I began becoming extremely emotional. I cried all the time, became so depressed getting dressed and brushing my teeth was a huge struggle; was paranoid, wanted to hurt myself, had crazy thoughts. I would sob at the drop of a hat, which ISN'T like me at all. Took months of confusion, emptiness, anger, and loneliness to figure out it was the Buspar. Loved it in the beginning, but unfortunately it was not for me!",3,88
BuSpar,"I recently started having panic attacks and was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. My doctor put my on Prozac but after 5 days I was having such horrible side effects she switched me over to BuSpar 5mg in the morning and 5mg in the evening. I am to up my dosage after 5 days to 7.5mg in the morning and then again in the evening. However, I feel dizzy, upset stomach and just exhausted. My doctor told me to give it time because I'm coming off a medicine and starting a new one at the same time. It is worse in the morning. I just want to feel better. I've had to take half of my 0.5mg Xanax just to take the edge off everyday and have zero appetite. I'm feeling hopeless and need some encouragement and help.",0,80
BuSpar,"I have recurring bouts with severe anxiety.  Six weeks ago, I was put on 30 mg's of Buspar to be taken in the morning and at night.  I got brain zaps (similar to Paxil withdrawal) and nausea lasting about an hour after I took the medication.  True to most other medicines for anxiety, I felt as though overall, my level of anxiety increased over the first 2 weeks although I would have periods where I was not anxious.  After 2 weeks the Dr raised my dose to 60 mg's. I found it best to take 4 times a day because I definitely feel it wear off. While this has taken my overall anxiety from a 9 to a 7, it is still not enough.",6,62
BuSpar,Made me better,10,70
BuSpar,I have been off and on BuSpar for a little over a year now for severe uncontrollable anxiety but I have to take a high dose for it to work. I just take it as needed. I take 40mg at night. That's when my anxiety seems to bother me the most. If my anxiety is bothering me really bad and I don't take it then I am always up all night long and sometimes 2 days straight. Overall I would recommend this medicine!,10,117
BuSpar,"Been taking buspirone on and off for 15 years, for insomnia, anxiety, and symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder.  Sleep is my #1 issue (or lack thereof).  Very effective for insomnia almost immediately upon starting it (after a period of not taking it). I sleep easier within the first day or two.  Within a week I get to sleep easier and more soundly.  Ironically I've always had the side-effect of vivid memorable dreams.  Doesn't seem to increase bad dreams though, just makes them more memorable.  No other side effects.  I have, depending on the stress in my life or other medicines being taken, generally been on 5mg/day to 20mg/day, with good results.  At 30mg/day I feel dopey. Prefer to take doses later in the day, not first thing in the morning.",10,135
BuSpar,"Started taking Buspar 15mg 2 times a day about a month ago and I will be honest, at first I hated it! I almost quit taking it! The first week it seemed as if it was making my anxiety worse. My chest was pounding and could not sleep at all! I decided to stick with it and I'm glad I did because all of that is gone now. I mainly had issues with social phobia, and I have noticed I am getting better in social situations. The only thing is every now and then I feel a little dizzy for about 20 minutes after taking it but that's it! It doesn't take anxiety away, but helps you deal with it and better rationalize things.",8,143
BuSpar,"Buspar allows me to rationally look at my intrusive thoughts without getting trapped in obsessive thinking.  I have taken Xanax in the past, and feel that this medication is superior, though it takes some time to build up in your system.  I was against being on medication for a few years, but plan on staying on Buspar indefinitely, as it improves my quality of life and decreases many of the physical symptoms of anxiety I have experienced in the past, such as muscle tension and teeth grinding.  I have also tried Celexa in the past, and unlike an SSRI, I do not feel zombied out in the least, just clearer and more at ease.  I highly recommend this medication!",9,239
BuSpar,"Been on this medication for over 12 years.  Works well for me. Calms me down without the brain zapping I got from Paxil and Lexapro. Dosage has been adjusted throughout the years. I am told 60mgs a day is the maximum dose. I am currently on 15mgs 3 times per day.  It took a good two weeks to get into my system, and I remember thinking it wasn't working at first.  It's no Xanax, but it has helped me much more then Paxil and Lexapro did.  This works well for me, and I have no issues taking it for the rest of my life.  I do get some increased hunger and minor dizziness after each dose for about 15 minutes, but that beats being anxious and worrying all the time.  It is also pretty cheap.",9,198
BuSpar,"I have been on many anti depressants and anxiety meds in the past but this one is the right one for me. It is the only medication that I have taken that does not cause erection problems. While it is no miracle pill, it does take the edge off and allows me to deal with things without anger. I am actually able to see the world in a positive light and not be so negative all of the time. I believe I am taking half of the 5mg pill three times a day. I was supposed to be up to a pill and a half three times a day by now, but stronger doses make me feel medicated and I do not like that. I am perfectly happy with the results and my ability to control my anxiety problems. My anxiety is still there, but controlling it is key to long term health.",10,206
BuSpar,"I'm 31yr old fem, and have been taking Buspar for anxiety/panic for three months, and have decided to discontinue. It took roughly 3 weeks before I noticed a difference. I am slower to irritate, less agitated, and can better manage the constant nagging sensation of anxiety. I've been sleeping better, but really require a full night's sleep or else I'm drowsy all day. And I've been more at ease with new people. These changes have been certainly been positive but minimal. Lately, every day, 2x's a day about 20 mins after my dose (10mg @ 2/day) I would get a ringing headache, body shocks, and dizziness or nausea. I thought this would go away, but it hasn't, and it is getting to the point that my anxiety level is increasing.",5,109
BuSpar,Buspar was okay at first. I felt more relaxed and less tense. But I've had high blood pressure and headaches almost every day on this. Dr is taking me off and going to try something else.,5,66
BuSpar,"I thought I was finally going to find the medication for me. At first it was O.K., I was on a low dose, a few days later when I was on a 5mg twice a day for only 4 days, I had been experiencing trouble concentrating, and woke up to my arm muscle twitching uncontrollably, which continued all night and onto the next day. So I quit the medication and called my MD.",4,63
BuSpar,I have been on Buspar for about 3 months. I take 30 mg a day. I feel it is effective but I still get anxious thoughts and worry about having panic attacks. Does this happen to anyone else maybe I just up my dose but I get dizzy for about 30 minutes and can't lay down while I'm working. I was on Paxil but the side effects were awful so my Dr switched me to this.,7,61
BuSpar,"So far so good, helps me walk away from unreasonable people instead of sharing my unwanted opinion. I have same side effects as mentioned, wondering if anyone has uncomfortable leg pains painful tingling (like a constant funny bone just got hit but towards the high painful part. Could be a pinched nerve and unrelated to Buspar.",9,69
BuSpar,"I suffer from anxiety and have tried several medications in the past. I just started using Buspar 5mg twice daily. I notice in the morning, I am dizzy and have vision problems, it goes away after about 30 mins and I find it is helpful to eat when I take it, as side effects are not as bad. I do like it as I am not as high strung throughout the day, my kids have noticed a big difference in my mood. I'm going to give it a bit longer.",5,115
BuSpar,"I have had three deaths in my family in the last few months, quite my good paying but stressful job, opened my own salon, started school, and having a hard time with my 19 yr old who has moved back home! All of this in the last 6 months! I finally went to my Dr. today and she described Buspar for me! I've only taken one dose and already feeling better so I know I should be really better after a few days! I don't like taking medicines but I was at my wits end! Now hopefully when I go back to school tomorrow I won't get kicked out for being so agitated at people that I walked out on Saturday!",0,90
BuSpar,"When taking the medicine, the first few hours my entire body would have random tingles, I would experience vertigo / become dizzy, and be nauseous. I took BusPar  / buspirone for about 3 weeks and quit after these effects + decreased sex drive.",1,77
BuSpar,I suffered a stroke 4/15/2012 I started having a gradual increase of anxiety to the point I could not stand it. My doc put me on Buspar 15mg starting out then up to 30mg all was great until the random suicide thoughts started I also take Celexa 40mg before the Buspar with no issues. So I contacted my doctor who has taken me off of it.,6,45
BuSpar,"Female 21yrs old. I have had severe anxiety attacks for the past 2 years, OCD since I can remember, and feel like I can't breath when I think about the what-ifs. I was on Prozac for a few months and absolutely loved it until I started grinding my teeth in my sleep. I tried the Buspar. I've been on it for 2 1/2 weeks. It took most of my anxiety away. But I got so dizzy I couldn't stand it (15mg). Started halving the pills, still makes me dizzy. Gives me headaches and doesn't help with the stress or obsessive compulsive disorder. My doc is adding Paxil to the Buspar and hopefully it'll help more.",9,67
BuSpar,"I developed generalized anxiety disorder seemingly out of nowhere after taking prednisone for an infection, and for three months felt like I could barely function, the physical and mental symptoms were so all-encompassing. My docs suggested Lexapro but I wasn't depressed, just anxious; I did some internet research on my own and asked that they try me on Buspar instead. SO GLAD I did. I've been on it for six years now and I feel totally normal, like I used to before the anxiety set in. I've never noticed any side effects to speak of, besides the weird flushed dizziness when I first started taking it, which went away after a couple of weeks. On 22.5 mg per day but I miss doses all the time, to very little effect. Amazing med.",10,187
BuSpar,After having tried Ativan and Vistaril I asked my family Dr for Buspar for acute anxiety. I also take Zoloft. I love Buspar. It's not habit forming and I feel like I have my life back! It's my miracle.,10,153
BuSpar,"I'm not exaggerating when I tell you all: This medicine has truly CHANGED my life! After suffering with clinical depression and anxiety for over 12 years, this is the only medicine that has completely taken the anxiety away. I take it along with Prozac 30mg and WOW what a difference it has made for me. (I've been on Prozac for 8-10 years). The Prozac helps with depression, but since my main problem was anxiety, it didn't help very much with that. Xanax wouldn't work for me like it used to, and after this last debilitating episode of anxiety, I had lost hope that anything would work for me. I'm only on 10mg on Buspar and it's literally made me the way I was before I started suffering all those years ago.  I feel like the REAL ME again! Amazing!",10,271
BuSpar,I have been taking Buspar for about two years for anxiety and panic attacks.   I take 10mg three times a day.   I never experienced any side effects.  I find them not to be a quick fix drug at first I thought they were rubbish but after being on them for about a month noticed my days of anxiety were getting less.  Recently I had a really bad day and took some Melatonin to help me sleep.   Next day I felt fine.  So been taking Melatonin each night and seem to be getting better by the day.   I have read that Buspar and Melatonin can treat Bipolar Disorder.    I am not Bipolar but these two combined have really helped me.   My husband has noticed that I'm so much more relaxed.,0,108
BuSpar,"At first I didn't think Buspar would help me since I have always relied on antidepressants for my mostly manageable anxiety with a very occasional Klonopin. But this past year I was diagnosed with bipolar and have been advised that SSRIs could trigger manic symptoms so I am on mood stabilizers but they do not help my ever increasing anxiety. It has gotten so bad I rarely leave the house and can't work. When I started Buspar at 7.5 Mg 2x/day it made me more anxious and all I did was cry for a week but I was encouraged to keep taking it and it would get better and it has! My quality of life is soo much better, I feel normal again. I do get dizzy after my morning dose and need to sit or lay down though for maybe a half hour to an hour.",9,94
BuSpar,It was really good medicine for people with anxiety and panics disorders. I been taking sertraline (Zoloft) 100 mg and Buspar 20 mg total morning and evening and it was really helping me out with general anxiety and reduce panics from my daily life. I had this thing when I go in to any store myself I feel like everyone is watching me like I am going to steal something. That triggers my anxiety and my stomach aches and breathing pattern switch to worst situation ever. Facial all red and it was really painful life. Buspar took care 70 percent of that problem for others was 9 out of 10. I say Yes to Buspar. I suggest talk with your psychiatrist about acute anxiety and consult about having Buspar.,8,81
BuSpar,"F-Age 60. I have taken Buspar for 20 years, starting in 1992, age 40. I would go off for 3 yrs after being on for 3 yrs. I had horrible relapse of anxiety, would have to go back on. Now I have been on for 6 years without stopping at 5mg 3-times a day. I love Buspar and plan to stay on for life without stopping. I have done things that I could never do without the Buspar, like hiking the grand canyon at age 58, just driving there would have given me panic, and even day to day stress. I will take my chances with long term, better than feeling sick daily, not being able to eat, sleep or leave the house, no way to live. Side effects for me slight dizziness.",10,156
BuSpar,"I took this medicine starting on a fairly low dose, then gradually adding higher doses.  I decided to take it for my generalized anxiety disorder. It had little to no effect on my anxiety despite being on it for months.  I know it works for some people, it just wasn't for me.",3,37
BuSpar,"I've had a great experience with Buspar 20 mg daily added on to 37.5 mg of Effexor XR. I have genralized anxiety disorder and Social Phobia, and Buspar has made an enormous improvement. The anxiety is not completely gone but much more manageable. Buspar is a great alternative for people who do not want to risk becoming addicted to the narcotics, such as Xanax. I take it twice a day in the morning and evening, 10mg each time. Within the hour I feel less anxious and calmer. It takes a few weeks to fully take effect (about 5-6 weeks for me), which my psych told me beforehand and I found accurate, so give it time.",10,89
BuSpar,"Works wonders for me.  My doctor started me on 10mg's 2x daily a month ago.  Now I am on 15mg's 2x daily.  Once in the morning and one in the evening.  I have taken anti-depressants for years now and have tried almost every one of them on the market.  Finally, I made myself see a psychiatrist. I was dealing with uncontrollable outbursts of anger. It made life difficult to the point I just wanted to stay at home alone. This was NOT me.  After a few days of taking this medicine I felt like I could deal with everyday life again.  Still taking things piece by piece but seemingly my moods are improving slightly because of this medicine. Give it a try.",8,71
BuSpar,I did not like this. I was given this for anxiety and it didnt help at all. I tried it for a month and felt no difference.,1,27
BuSpar,"I am responding very well to this medication (7.5 mg twice a day since 6/3/12) for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (with associated panic attacks and depression). My anxiety is back down to a healthier level (not completely gone) and I'm not having as many panic attacks (they still wake me up in the middle of the night most nights). Overall, I feel less depressed (because I'm less anxious). I'm doing everything I can to help myself. I exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, don't smoke, don't drink, stay away from caffeine, and I read/listen to lots of self-help books/authors. It's not easy, but things are getting better. Buspar definitely helps.",9,82
BuSpar,Buspar seemed to increase my anxiety and caused sleep disturbance.  I woke up several times during the night feeling anxious.,1,46
BuSpar,"This medicine has been a God send to me for stressful situations at my job. Unfortunately I had side effects. It has affected my taste buds. Sweet don't taste as good as they used to, which for me wasn't a bad thing.",10,45
BuSpar,"Good, very good.",10,31
BuSpar,In the airforce I had a quack colonel who decided to change my xanax to buspar. It was so bad I could not stand up with or without taking it with food. It felt like daydreaming. Luckily I was put back on xanax.,3,19
BuSpar,Before Buspar my anxiety from post traumatic stress disorder was very out of control. Xanax and Ativan barely touched it. My constant anxiety led to a suicide attempt because I was in constant fear which felt like constant panic. I've taken Buspar 15mg 3x a day for almost a month now and I have my life back. Only side effect is a little tiredness. But I will take that over what my life was like.,8,78
BuSpar,I tried Buspar for three months and it did not work at all for my anxiety.,1,18
BuSpar,"After trying SSRIs and other medicines, I have finally found Buspar and it has changed my life in less than two weeks! I have had mild to moderate anxiety for a few years and now that I'm taking Buspar (I only need 15 mg/day in divided doses). I feel normal again and my mood is more positive and I laugh/am happy more even in this tough economic time! No major side effects. The first couple of days it made me a little tired and that's it. Really started noticing changes about 8-9 days I could feel a huge difference and the anxiety is GONE!  This is a safe medicine to take (non habit forming) and I would recommend it to anyone.  It has change my life, thank you Buspar.",10,107
BuSpar,"I have been taking Buspar 10mg 3 times a day for the past 3 months for anxiety and panic attacks. I think for the most part my panic attacks have subsided but still experience a bit of anxiety and increased blood pressure. I do take Xanax 0.25mg from time to time if my anxiety gets too bad or too stressed. I do notice I feel slightly lethargic and run down most of the time while I have been on this. Also after each dose I get some dizziness about 45 minutes afterwards which lasts for about 45 minutes or an hour. I used to have a spark to me before taking it, but I guess I'll take the good with the bad for the time being.",6,23
BuSpar,I found this medicine helped a lot with my anxiety in many ways but did not help my desire for sex that I suffer from by the other medications I am on for depression. But like in any medication you have to chose what is most important to you and my anxiety was out of control prior to taking Buspar.,6,23
BuSpar,"After being on Zoloft for a while and trying hydroxyzine, which both did nothing for my anxiety, Buspar has also had no effect whatsoever after almost a month. Still taking 100mg Zoloft but might stop taking the Buspar. I see no reason for putting another useless chemical in my body.",1,18
BuSpar,"I have only been on BuSpar a few days.  I can tell a difference in the anxiety and general anxious feeling.  I had been thinking that it might not be helping as much as it needs to be, but after reading everyones comments I think I will stick with it.  Maybe I need a higher dose than what I am taking now.  Thank you for making me see that this medicine is worth sticking with it.",8,45
BuSpar,"I have been taking Buspar for about 6 yrs for anxiety and panic disorder. I started out 10 mg morning and night. When my anxiety got better, I just took it at night. 3 weeks ago I had another panic attack and have been sick with anxiety ever since. Dr. told me to start taking it twice a day again, which I did and already better. I don't tolerate antidepressants at all....so this medicine is a miracle for me.",9,73
BuSpar,"So far this med has been fantastic. I've been dealing with social as well as general anxiety. The first day taking it I felt markedly better. If this medication keeps up like this, I may actually be able to a normal life.",0,59
BuSpar,I tried it for anxiety and aggresive behavior.  With in a few minutes of taking the first dosage I became catonic.  Tried again two more times and each time the same thing;  Dr. changed my medication after that and said that happens in a very few patients on Buspar.,1,13
BuSpar,"I have been taking Buspar for almost a year now, 15mg, 3Xdaily. I think my anxiety is a bit more severe, but this medicine has worked wonders for the majority of last year for me- I had only a few times where I would have to take 1/2 of a 0.25mg Xanax for breakthrough panic attacks. Lately, though, I've had a number of additional stressors added to my life and noticed a great deal of additional panic attacks, causing my doctor to request that I add an SSRI to my current Buspar intake. I haven't started the SSRI yet, and surprisingly today, since I kind of made a mental decision that I have absolutely NO control over the things in my life that are stressing me out,and had a good cry yesterday, my anxiety level seems back down to normal.",0,17
BuSpar,"I have generalized anxiety disorder. For me, BuSpar does its job: it decreases those fears and worries that plague your life.  However, it takes a while for the medication to get into your system. I would not recommend this medication to anyone who is struggling with short-term stress (divorce, legal problems, etc.). If you're prone to panic attacks, don't expect to just take one of these and expect to feel okay. The memory loss from this medication is frustrating.",6,27
BuSpar,"Buspar made my head cloudy.  I would feel dizzy, had chest pains, and felt like my heart was fluttering.  All anxiety was gone, but so were my emotions after only a day and a half.  My wife said it was like I was stoned.  I am now on Celexa and will see how that works.",1,21
BuSpar,"Amazing. I thought my life was over. I dealt with anxiety since childhood. At times it was worse than others but in the past 9 months it has become so severe that it manifested into unbearable physical symptoms. I was experiencing a cycle of extreme hot flashes that would drench me in sweat, the hot sweat turned to cold dampness quickly turning to violent chills. Uncontrollable heaving made me vomit a dozen times a day. I would wake every day in a full blown anxiety attack. I wasn't able to eat or even quit shivering. I lost 15 pounds in 3 weeks, was so emaciated, dehydrated I really felt like I was dying. In 3 days Buspar made me feel NORMAL. Not zombied or depressed like other medicines. Buspar saved my life, or at least gave me the ability to live.",10,132
BuSpar,"Taking this medicine I began to feel despair on and off and suddenly, after 30 days, it hit me very very hard with heavy despair thoughts. I had to hold my head for an hour or two waiting for the Buspar to dissolve completely. I had to stop taking it. It's sad because I needed this medicine.",1,17
BuSpar,It helps me from pulling my hair out but I still have anxiety.,6,14
BuSpar,"I have been on a moderate dose of Effexor XR (150mg) for about two years and anxiety started to creep in lately.  My doctor put me on 5mg of Buspar 3x a day about a month ago.  So far it seems to have taken the sharp edge off of the anxiety, but it isn't the miracle I was hoping for. He just raised my dose to 15mg 2x a day, so I'll report back in a month or so to see if the dosage increase helps.",6,18
BuSpar,"Between the anxiety and fear of a full-blown panic attack, (they occur about 3xs per year) I was unable to work, maintain relationships or accept new challenges. Have been taking 15mg 2xs a day since October 2011. It works with no side effects. I have my sense of humor back.",10,71
BuSpar,I cried for the for the first week on Buspar which for me is expected when taking a new medication. Once that week was over Buspar came to the rescue. Buspar has given me progress in my recovery and has dented that wall of fog. It has helped me purge most of my guilt and resentment and helped me notice some of my defects. I am only taking 10mg right now. And after trying a number of different anti anxiety medications I think I've found the one. All hail Buspar.,10,53
BuSpar,"I'm 19 years old and I can honestly say after taking Buspar for close to 3 weeks so far it has saved my life and my ability to function. I had tried medicines like Clonazepam and Xanax before with minimal outcome. I hope someone else get's the help they need from this medicine because I can only imagine all of the people suffering and I feel so bad. Buspar, A",10,90
BuSpar,"Started at 5mg twice a day.  Got dizzy about 20 mins after taking it but that didn't last long.  After a week I just didn't feel it was helping, but I also was given gabapentin for pain which my doctor said would help with anxiety.  Afraid to take the two together so just stopped the Buspar. I'm thinking I will try adding the Buspar back in again and giving it a little bit longer.  Hoping for better.",4,7
BuSpar,"I've been on Buspar for about 6 weeks. At first I had headaches that turned into migraines. After taking 15 mg in am, 15 in the pm as prescribed. I no longer have experienced anxieties attacks and handle stress much better.",8,23
BuSpar,"For the past 2-3 years, I have been on and off Lexapro/Ativan for Anxiety and Wellbutrin for quitting smoking. I stopped taking Lexapro about a year ago with excellent results. I basically just felt great and didn't need to take it anymore. I continued taking Wellbutrin (daily) and Ativan (as needed). Then I stopped taking both of those about 6 months ago because I was feeling great. Well, my anxiety started up again several months ago and I got back on Wellbutrin and Ativan, which have always helped me tremendously. However, I wanted to stop relying on the benzo (Ativan) and therefore, started taking Buspar. I have got NOTHING from it besides dizziness and a headache. I have been taking Buspar for about 2 months. I am starting Lexapro again.",2,11
BuSpar,"It has helped with anxiety so much but it made me space out a lot so we had to reduce the dose, but it does work.",9,17
BuSpar,I knew I needed something to take off the edge of my stressful life. I am on a tight budget without prescription drug coverage so I was prescribed this medicine since it was on WalMart's generic drug program ($10/90 day supply 10 mg only).  I feel so much more relaxed and much less OCD.  My only concern is that I have trouble concentrating and focusing at times.,9,21
BuSpar,"Been on Buspar for 3 weeks. Weened off of lorazepam and using Buspar instead.  Big difference.  Started on 15mg 3 times a day. Then 30 mg 3 times a day.  Now experiencing muscle pain, upset stomach, bad taste in mouth. I think my dosage is to high. At 15mg no bad side effects. When I get dosage straightened out. I think this will be a fine medication for my anxiety problem.",8,26
BuSpar,This medication does not work for my anxiety on it's own. My Doctor had me on Klonopin along with Buspar and I was doing great. Well since the government added their new laws he took the Klonopin away from me so my anxiety is back full force and he won't give me anything else to treat my anxiety. I think that is wrong.,1,27
BuSpar,Made me very dizzy and lightheaded.,4,13
BuSpar,"I've been taking Buspar for about a week and a half now and haven't really seen any dramatic results so far. I started out taking a 15mg pill in the morning and a 15mg pill in the evening, being a total of 30 mg total. This gave me awful headaches and I started experiencing light headedness. I bumped my dosage down to half of that now, and am currently feeling better when it comes to the side-effects. Hopefully by the 3rd or 4th week I will get the full effect from this medicine.",7,16
BuSpar,"I've been taking Buspar for about two weeks now and it seems to be helping my mild anxiety pretty well! I started off taking half of the dose my doctor gave me just to introduce it slowly into my system. I'm now up to the full dose of 5mg twice a day. The only side effects I've noticed is that my stomach gets a little bit loud about a half an hour after I take the morning dose, (literally loud, gurgles and grumbles) but it goes away within about 20 minutes. I would definitely recommend it for mild to moderate anxiety.",9,30
BuSpar,"I started taking it over a month ago and it hasn't help my anxiety at all. My hands and legs are shaky, I am constantly dizzy, have a hard time focusing, and my stomach is upset a lot.",1,25
BuSpar,"Peaks and Valleys: I felt like I had peaks and valley's of its effect (and side-effects).  I would feel its effects one hour after I took it, and they would be mostly gone six hours after the dose.  So even taking it four times a day did not provide stable relief.   Effects: It cut my anxiety down by about 40%.  Benzodiazepines cut it by about 90%.   Side-Effects: -I felt a roaring sensation in my head.   -It also made me feel depressed sometimes. Buspar side effects aren't too bad, but it doesn't provide that much relief either.",4,14
BuSpar,"Buspar has worked great on my mild to moderate anxiety. I take it in combination with Ativan (as needed), but generally find I do not need the Ativan more than a couple times a month. Buspar has worked very well for me and has the great advantage of not being habit forming, so I feel safe taking it on the long term.  That being said, it takes about 3 weeks to kick in fully. It also makes me dizzy if I take it differently than normal (with food as opposed to without, vice versa). It would also not be a good choice for someone with moderate to severe anxiety, as it is not a very strong drug. I take it in combination with a good diet and exercise, but doubt it would work as well without them.",9,26
BuSpar,"I tried a lot of the SSRIs and SNRIs medicines, Lexapro, Effexor, Celexa, Wellbutrin, pristiq, Paxil. Lexapro and Effexor gave me monster insomnia, could not sleep for nothing. Wellbutrin made me pass out and the other 2 did nothing for me. Finally my Doctor put me on Buspar 7.5 two times a day. It did make me nauseated but it says to take it on a full stomach which I took on an empty stomach. After I followed the directions I didn't have any more issues. No side effects and my libido has increased (wife happy). Really no more issues with anxiety anymore, I can now go to dinner, the grocery store without any issues.",8,72
BuSpar,"I really like how the Buspar worked for me I was given 10mg tablet half to a whole up to three times a day and it did wonderful to help tame my anxiety. I had to lower my dosage of Buspar because the original diagnosis of anxiety, depression in ADHD might be Bipolar disorder instead but I really didn't experience much side effect except maybe lactation without pregnancy but that may have been Celexa causing it.",9,10
BuSpar,"Simply amazing. I have extremely awful anxiety and I guess you might consider I have panic attacks at times...usually over worrying about my children.  I was just sitting here in crying fit and thought to myself, You know you can take your 2nd dose of Buspar now, it's okay, you get three a day!  SO, I did and I feel so much better. The crying has already stopped, after 30 minutes of taking the medicine. I was researching the medicine online and found this site and when I did, I knew I had to post to help others who might be in my same situation.  JUST TRY IT. You can't go wrong in trying it.",10,114
BuSpar,"I've suffered with anxiety at critical periods in my life and was advised by MD's to try antidepressants as an alternative to Ativan.  The side effects were intolerable. BuSpar has been miraculous for me. The first week was an adjustment, with ups and downs in mood and some restlessness.  On the 7th day I awoke to even, stable calm and increased concentration which has been consistent.  My advice is stay with it for a couple of weeks using a benzodiazapine as needed until you stabilize. I had few side effects and those eventually disappeared.",8,75
BuSpar,"I started taking Buspar about 2 months ago, 5mg 3 X a day and it has really helped me quite a bit. I was VERY nervous about trying this medicine, after having a terrible experience with an SSRIs, but I had TOO much anxiety NOT to give it a try plus the fact that it is non-habit forming appealed to me. I do get a touch of dizziness about 15-20 minutes after taking it- but it's not completely debilitating. My doctor has just recommended for me to up my dosage to 10mg- 3X a day, so I'll keep you all posted and let you know how that goes. It DEFINITELY has helped though, so for that, I am very thankful.",8,61
BuSpar,"After reading these other comments I must say that this medication has affected me greatly in a good way. I have had a lot of health problems in the past and I have taken multiple different anxiety medications that have not worked. The first day I took this medication, I have already started to feel a change. Plus this is also a good medication for women who are pregnant who have anxiety.",10,32
BuSpar,"This medicine has significantly reduced my anxiety. I still have a little anxiety, but without this medicine my anxiety would be extremely high.",9,34
BuSpar,"Take 30 mg/day, helped mildly with my GAD. Did nothing for my social anxiety. I continue to take it because it has no side effects and am told it will help with anxiety I may get from taking Wellbutrim. I have to take Xanax or Clonazepam regularly when having moderate/severe anxiety. Only side effects experienced in the first few days was dizziness and insomnia. I was able to increase my dose within 2 weeks. I am considering increasing my dose of Buspar to see if I just need a higher dose to feel a stronger effect.",5,17
BuSpar,"I'm just now starting to up it to 20mg/day. I also take 2 other SSRI type medications, and have been on depression medicines for about 20 years. Being currently unemployed and very little money, I can relate to others here when they say they are stuck in fear. I'm hoping this thing gives me some relief. Life is already too hard.",8,35
BuSpar,"I have been taking this medicine for 2 years and it is the only thing that has worked for me. I finally asked my doctor about a non narcotic anxiety drug, and she gave me BuSpar. I am so grateful. I still have some unwarranted worries, but no where near the level I have experienced them without BuSpar.",9,50
BuSpar,"I started Buspar four days ago, and my anxiety is unbearable now. I suffer from severe migraine which has gotten worse since the first dose. Since it's only been days maybe I will try one more week to see if my anxiety gets better but from the looks of it I doubt it.",2,11
BuSpar,"I've been on this medication for over two months. BuSpar helps with day to day, general anxiety. That said, I don't feel that I can rely on this medication to stop a panic attacks. I still have agoraphobic feelings, and certain anxious thoughts (hypochondria type things) that haven't ceased since before starting this medication.  Side effects I've noticed: Lightheadedness. Moderate fatigue. Munchies, snackyness. Increased libido and depth of taste.  Give it a try. Compared to SSRI's, it seems to be as effective without changing one's brain chemistry so drastically.",7,33
BuSpar,"I started taking Buspar only a few days ago, 7.5 mg in the morning and evening and so far have experienced the dizziness only in the morning.  Had some nausea, but don't know if I can attribute that to the medication or the fact that I've stopped taking Ativan.  So far, so good though.  I do feel a little less anxious already and am excited to see the full results.",8,32
BuSpar,"I'm on a very low dose -- 5mg/day -- but have had success until recently. I have never had any side effects or ever felt drugged.  It just reduced my anxiety and tendency toward agoraphobia. Recently the agoraphobia has been winning so I have contacted my Doctor to either raise my dose or try a different medication.  I just can't get myself out the door;  it's like walking to the end of a high diving board. Stress and panic increases as I get to the end, then the horrible fall like I'm having a heart attack.  Finally floating in the water I am actually fine, and even enjoy myself.",7,41
BuSpar,"The doctor just put me on this medication for my high anxiety. I was taking Xanex 1mg and switched me to this, its been 2 days taking it at a 7.5 mg and I'm really not noticing any relief at all.",3,13
BuSpar,"Buspar has been wonderful for me. Out of the blue last year, I experienced my first panic attack (thought I was having a heart attack). I have tried several medicines and nothing seemed to help. SSRI have too many side effects and Xanax and Valium did nothing. I started on Klonopin and Buspar after 6 months I stopped. The buspar and was doing great up until 2 months ago and they came back for no reason. I was started back on Buspar with the Klonopin and feeling pretty good. Buspar takes about 43 minutes to make me dizzy and lasts for about 20 minutes then I am good. I just make sure I take it at a good time. I take 10mg in the morning and 10 mg at night and 0.5 mg Klonopin 1 tab in morning and 1/2 tab early afternoon and 1 tab at bedtime.",0,36
BuSpar,"I take this medicine 20mg in the morning and 20mg at night. When I first started it I had trouble sleeping. I felt like my legs couldn't sit still, and I had tingly fingers and I would get dizzy. I've been on it for about 5 months and I still get dizzy after each dose sometimes I need to lay down. But it has helped tremendously with my anxiety, I can go out and have fun without having the constant worry in my head. Before being on any kind of medicine I used to throw up and shake a lot from my anxiety attacks, now its all gone and I can live a normal life. I am also on 100mg of Pristq and 0.25mg of Xanax (as needed). I recommend this medicine for anyone who has anxiety disorder, but just be aware of the dizziness.",7,47
BuSpar,I have been on Buspar for 8 months and it has mellowed me out without the feeling of being drugged. I have noticed that if I miss a dose my old grumpy and panic attack self comes back quickly. I have tried many things to help control my depression and panic attacks and this drug makes me feel better but I have to control my feelings more.  In other words it does not make you so numb that you are out of it like other drugs. It just takes the edge off. I recently also discovered that it could be the reason for my increased sex drive. I may be showing signs of hair loss (but it's hard to tell given I am of that age when it happens) but I will take a better feeling and libido over hair. I have also on occasion noticed a metallic taste.,8,53
BuSpar,At first it worked pretty well but about 3 months later I was having the anxiety again.,4,18
BuSpar,I took this medication for 9 years and I believe it had an accumulative effect on me. I weened myself off and am still having problems sleeping and am now more irritable than ever.  I was also on Dilantin and phenobarbital.  I wish I had found this site when researching this medication.  Initially it did help me and I had good results but I had to break the dosage in half.,6,20
BuSpar,I have been taking BuSpar for 8 plus years.  I still have some side effects of dizziness if taken on an empty stomach and coffee but I think that is asking for trouble.  I can honestly say it saved my marriage and family life.  High stressed medical position always being on call which increased my anxiety. Anxiety was at such a level that no one could stand to be around me.  I take 10mg once in the morning which lowers my anxiety to a tolerable level for the day.  When I feel extra stress coming on I take 10mg in the morning and 10mg at night.  It does not work for everyone as many have mentioned but it has given me a second wind to enjoy life to the fullest.,10,210
BuSpar,Medicine made me dizzy and nauseous.  I actually got anxious taking anti-anxiety medicine. Had to stop,1,37
BuSpar,I was given this medication when my PTSD related anxiety and panic was too strong for Vistaril to even touch. I've been on BuSpar for almost 8 months with no change in my Anxiety or Panic frequency. I have switched doctors and am now on 0.5mg of Xanax x 2 a day with no complaints.,1,27
BuSpar,"I am now into my 3rd week and for myself it worked by the next morning. I had a past of 20  years on prescription Ativan and the after effects of stopping that medication made me very wary of trying anything else for my attacks. But my life had stopped and I truly felt no hope for the future so I laid it all out for my doctor and mentioned that I had noticed an article on Buspar and with little or no side effects or chance of addiction it seemed a chance I would take. My doctor said she had prescribed it many times chosing it for those same reasons with her patients. Since then my anxiety is almost non-existent. I don't feel medicined at all. It did mess with my stomach some but nothing to change my opinion of the medicine. Last hope, best decision.",9,320
BuSpar,It didn't work for me at all.,1,46
BuSpar,"I have a bipolar disorder with anxiety and have been taking Seroquel for the bipolar condition for more than 5 years.  I decided to try the Buspar to help with the anxiety using 2 X 10mg per day and it works wonders.  At first the side effects made me cry for nothing but after 1 week everything got resolved and I see the benefits.  No real side effects for me since I use Seroquel which is much stronger on the side effects.  What I see is that I can have dreams again which didn't happen for for the last 20 years and a lot less anxiety.  Less closing of the hands reflects, calm, no social phobia, or performance anxiety.  It is working very well for me and now I need to do more with my life since I have the capacity.  Thanks",8,90
BuSpar,"I have been taking Buspar for 2 weeks now. My doctor started me on 10mg - 3 times a day right off the bat. It has taken away the constant buzzing in my head. The general feeling of dread, helplessness, anxiety and constant worry along with irratibility and agitation that I haven't been able to shake since being weaned off Klonopin. (I was on Klonopin for 5 years). It has given me no side affects. I still do not sleep well, but today, I cannot imagine NOT taking this medicine because I feel 10X better than I did 2 weeks ago!",10,126
BuSpar,I started taking BuSpar for my anxiety and it made me very dizzy and tired. It also made my arms tingle and I started getting terrible headaches every time I took it. My anxiety just got worse while taking it because I was worried about the side effects it was causing.,1,63
BuSpar,"I began on 5mg in the morning and at night. I became extremely dizzy, flush, and sleepy. I lowered the dosage and got tingles all over my body. I would touch something and the tingles would run up my arm and then up to my head.  After a few weeks I became enraged and could not control my anxiety. I stopped using the drug and got a few migraines but the rage is gone.",2,37
BuSpar,Before I started taking buspar it felt like there was a ticking time bomb inside my body and throughout the years it just got louder and louder. I would have so much panic and fear that I stood still to avoid having to move forward in life. After I started taking buspar that tick went away and the fear lessened enough for me to start taking steps forward to better my life and my families life... I have nothing but good things to say about this.,10,256
BuSpar,"I had taken Buspar many years ago until one day I decided I just didn't need it anymore and stopped taking it, no weaning, no withdrawal. Now I'm back on it again and will stay on it until I feel that way again. It took a couple weeks, and a few days of depression, before it took hold but I have never experienced any side effects. In fact the only thing I feel is that I am thinking positively, rather than looking for a boogey-man in everything. Just a natural feeling of health. Recently the doctor tried something else because of poor sleep and gave me lorazepam, which made my arms and legs feel heavy and I slept for 12 hours, and then diazepam which did nothing much but dampened my feelings and sleep was worse. I'll stay with Buspar.",10,148
BuSpar,"I was prescribed BuSpar by my doctor and I am hesitant to take it. I have seizure disorder and take Dilantin (phenytoin). My doctor is aware of this, but I have read that BuSpar may negatively react to the seizure medication. I hope it works and doesn't interact with my other medicines. I have been on benzodiazepines such as Klonopin and Xanax and built up a tolerance. I was taking unusually high dosages and was recently weened off.",5,21
BuSpar,"I started Buspar about 7 months ago and after almost 2 weeks stopped taking it due to it giving me the shakes, but my worry and anxiety continued. I tried 5-HTP and that didn't work, so about a month ago my prescription was still there and I started taking Buspar again, and I'm on 7.5 mg twice a day and I feel a big difference, I think the key is to take it like its prescribed. No side effects since I have started taking it again.",8,53
BuSpar,"A little over 2 years ago I started feeling anxiety thinking of bad thing that would happen to me or my family. I would worry about these things every day and then I would have trouble breathing and it was all do to anxiety.  My doctor prescribed Buspar and everything went away and I felt normal and stress free and the feelings I had went away. I also read Buspar is for short term, but as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. You should take it as long as you need to. Without it I would be a wreck.  As for side effects I get dizzy and tired, I take one 15mg at night and the other in the afternoon after work and take about a 30 minute break and lay down or just watch T.V. I feel much better after that.",10,89
BuSpar,I have been taking Buspar for over 2 years and have had a lot of success. Recently had to increase my dosage to 15mg twice a day as my anxiety started to increase this past summer for no apparent reason. I also take 60mg of Cymbalta every other day but think the Buspar is what really is working for me. I feel for all people that have issues with anxiety! It's the worst and horrible to go through. Hopefully Buspar will keep working for me.,8,63
BuSpar,"I was hoping this medicine would help with my anxiety and depression but it made me feel terrible. I took my 1st dose at night, low dose of 7.5 then again in the morning...about an hour later.....I was so dizzy,almost fainted. My husband was wondering what was wrong with me. I lay down in my bed and stayed there till all these feelings went away. Didn't work for me!",1,37
BuSpar,"I have been on Xanax, Ativan, Valium and most of the other drugs in the benzodiazepine family. I had built up a tolerance to most of them, so my Doctor prescribed Buspar.  Not being part of the benzodiazepine family, the effects are different and a bit more subtle then I have been used to, however, I have learned to appreciate the difference, because I was looking for something different.  Buspar at least for myself is looking promising.  I also have LexApro, but am hesitant to mix these two medicines at the same time.",7,54
BuSpar,"I wish I could say that Buspar helped me.  I was really hoping that I would have the same experience as some of the individuals here.  I think the Buspar actually made my anxiety worse. However, I didn't feel any side effects until I took it for about 2 weeks.   I had the dizziness and fatigue that many have commented on, but also the less common side effects like gastrointestinal problems, nausea, confusion, and lack of concentration.  I had to stop taking it because it was impairing me so badly.  I hope that this medication works for others but it, unfortunately, did not for me.",3,72
BuSpar,"After reading all of the comments I had to comment also. I have taken Buspar for 8 years. I have noticed a lot of weight gain, which I thought was from this medicine. I have not seen that in anyone's comment. So I am now thinking it is my lifestyle. I do get dizzy so I have to lay down for 30 minutes after every dose. I am supposed to take 1/2 pill twice a day but laying down is not an option for me on most days so I skip a dose or two. Sometimes I do not take it for weeks. I do notice when I take it for a few days like I should that when I miss a dose I am even more agitated/aggravated/anxious and as one said looking for the bad that is around the corner. Thank you all for helping me decide to finally take this as I am supposed to.",10,118
BuSpar,"Hallucinated, would laugh hysterically for no reason for an hour, then would cry for an hour. This is only after taking one pill.",1,31
BuSpar,"I've got generalized anxiety disorder. Buspar turns off the worrying like a switch. The only downside was the first dose; 15mg was too much. I had weird side effects; if I looked at a light source, I'd feel unspeakably strange pulses of something that felt like electricity go though my body. I also got motion sick and vomited after the first dose. Luckily this only happened once. After reducing the dose to 5mg (q.i.d.), I had no more side effects. My advice to the uninitiated would be to start with a small dose and titrate upwards to avoid any surprises.",10,214
BuSpar,After only 3-4 days I was immediately better. I couldn't believe it because my doctor had put me on all sorts of medicines before this one and Buspar SAVED my life! The only side effect I noticed with it was that 30 minutes after taking it I was a little dizzy but it went away after a half hour and I was finally stress free with no panic or anxiety attacks.,10,133
BuSpar,I must be the only one on here that didn't benefit from this medication.... just got a headache and didn't help my anxiety.,1,233
BuSpar,My doctor prescribed Buspar for anxiety.  I have been taking this for 4 weeks and I am concerned because I read from some of the comments that this is prescribed for short term use.  It really is working for me and the thought of not taking it terrifies me.,8,49
BuSpar,"This medicine has been a lifesaver for me. After 10 years of anxiety and 2 years of being practically invalid due to generalized anxiety disorder and panic attacks with depression, I'm finally having a medicine that works.  Neuroleptics like ketiamine just made me gain weight, Cipralex was a little help, but not really adding quality of life. After 5 days on Buspar I'm clearly better. Sleeping is in place, I'm feeling more functional and positive and my ability to go out and even exercise has come back. I have now been on this medicine over three months and every day my life gets a little bit better.",10,309
BuSpar,"This medication is unbelievable. After 3 days, the anxiety I have been suffering with for over 15 years disappeared. I don't feel cloudy headed or unable to function. It's as if one day I woke up and my life is stress free. I did not suffer any side effects but I am also not on any other medication. I do not drink or smoke. I was opposed to medication at first, but now I am a believer.",10,535
BuSpar,Always had negative side effects and weight gain with SSRI's. SSNRI's didn't realy do anything either.  I am not a depressive person by nature so was not really sure why my General practitioner prescribed those.  Saw a psychiatrist who was a lifesaver in recommending and prescribing Buspar for me. I am not worrying or irritable only after 3 days.  He has me on 1/2 a pill in the am and 1/2 at night and is still slowly increasing it up to an ideal dose of 30mg a day.  Thank you Buspar.,9,141
BuSpar,"I was given this in the 1980's for panic attacks and was not taking any benzodiazepines at all with it. I'm glad it has worked so well for others, but for me it was like a very bad trip. I was literally bouncing from wall to wall, couldn't walk or see clearly, even hallucinating. I had a severe reaction to it, but I am extremely sensitive to tricyclics and all SSRI's except Remeron. If you're taking it for the first time, might be good to have another person around just in case.",1,63
BuSpar,For acute anxiety this is AMAZING. Rapid racing heartbeat. Excessive sweating. Constant worrying. Over-analyzing. This medicine basically at 15MG gives you a feeling like you just drank a six pack and ate an amazing meal.  I take it with xanax and cymbalta. Buspar is the best non habit forming short term medicine to get your life back on track when life gets overwhelming.,10,326
BuSpar,Restless legs was a main side effect for me.,3,41
BuSpar,"Prescribed BuSpar for anxiety and panic disorder.  This medicine seems to be a much better option for me than the SSRI drugs.  The side effects experienced are dizziness, tingling in the fingertips, vivid dreams and the occasional stomach ache.  Been taking 5mg, 5 times a day. I do also compliment the medicine with the occasional 0.25mg Xanax when needed.  After 3 weeks I do notice a big difference in the amounts of anxiety and a elimination of symptoms, which used to work their way to the panic stage. So far between these medicines, daily exercise, self education, and therapy I seem to be making some progress. I would recommend giving it a try.",9,124
BuSpar,"I was put in the hospital with MRSA IN my lungs. I was really mentally frustrated and was having withdrawals from morphine. I couldn't sleep and was very ill. This medicine was the greatest thing they could have given me to help me calm down and sleep. I would recommend it, but I will say that it knocked me out cold for the night and I was groggy in the morning. But when I decided to quit taking it, I had no withdrawal symptoms.",10,57
BuSpar,I've never had any issues with taking this medication.,10,60
BuSpar,"Have been taking Buspar for over 10 years along with an antidepressant.  Before taking Buspar, anxiety attacks were so bad that I could not work for several years.  I take it at night and no side effects, unlike other anti-anxiety medicines.",10,150
BuSpar,I've been taking Buspar for two years to control the symptoms of anxiety.  Buspar has worked well for me.  I had strong physical sensations of anxiety such as a knot in my stomach and hot flushes (can't be menopause because I'm a guy).  Also Buspar helps me control my thoughts that some terrible event is just around the corner and I've got to do something to prepare for this unknown event.  I've not had any side effects.,9,595
BuSpar,"After trying to treat my anxiety and panic attacks for years with SSRIs and benzodiazepines, this finally works. I take 3 x 5 mg and started to experience a significant decrease in anxiety and compulsive thoughts, after only 4 days. So far I am happy with Buspar. No side effects whatsoever.",10,234
BuSpar,I have been taking it for almost a month. The Dr said it might be 2 weeks before i started feeling better but actually I felt better within 3 days. I am taking it for panic attacks and anxiety associated with a traumatic event.,8,189
BuSpar,"I have been taking Buspar for just over 8 months and I take 60-75 mg a day, depending on the day. I take for panic attacks associated with PTSD. I have had no side effects from this, but I do know when I have missed a dose, so when I do come off this I do expect a withdrawal period but for now it has helped me regain a normal life. I take this with a few other medicines such as Celexa, Wellbutrin, Trazadone and seroqeul. This really works.",10,123
BuSpar,"I have been taking this medicine 15mg in the morning and 15mg at night and it works great.  Never had any medical problems before then last year all of a sudden I had a panic attack and was in bed three weeks with anxiety, it scared me to death. I was in such fear I shook.  This drug took three weeks to get me OK but it's now been 19 months without anxiety I hope it works long term. I still fear another panic attack it was horrible expecially for someone who had always been healthy and happy.",10,355
BuSpar,I have been taking Buspar for almost a week.  My doctor prescribed it for my Anxiety - mainly my constant agitation.  I must say that I have been sleeping better and I feel somewhat better.  I take Buspar 15mg - Once a day.,9,185
BuSpar,This medicine works very well for me. I have not experienced any side affects. I have been taking this medicine for two years and I am very grateful my Doctor prescribed it.,10,215
BuSpar,"Buspar has been very effective for me in treating occasional panic attacks and generalized anxiety, without side effects I've experienced with other medications such as Paxil. Doctors have been inclined to prescribe other medications as my anxiety symptoms often occur with emotional situations (death of loved one etc.) and I am crying alot. However the emotion is a natural reaction to the situation. Anti-depressant meds affected me negatively in contrast to buspar which helps alot.",10,392
Xanax,"Ive had benzodiazepine prescriptions (ativan, k-pin, &amp; xanax) since 15 y/o until now (20 y/o). Over the past 5 years, its been rough managing physical and psychological dependency issues. Ill blackout for a week at a time and proceed to buy fake xans from friends (usually cut with fentanyl and other bad stuff). During my attempt to wean off the drug, I ended up having a grand mal seizure at a party (Dec. 2019). Since then, managing sobriety from all benzos has lead to self medicating through other substances  (cannabis, ketamine, cocaine, kratom, norcos). I was living in my sororitys chapter house but moved into a fraternity house about 3 months ago, in which 3 brothers are active xanax users. It is really rough  Basically, if youre prone to addiction (runs in the family, other psychiatric conditions, etc) watch out dude",3,7
Xanax,"I have used Xanax for 20 years. Always taken it as needed, and it works wonderfully, no side effects at all, no getting used to it as evidenced by not using it for days and no withdrawal. I tried everything else suffering severe side effects like Seroquel. I only need 1mg twice a day, maybe on real panic day three times.",10,31
Xanax,"This drug has saved me on a thousand occasions, from generalized anxiety to panic attacks or somatic tension, up to situations of severe insomnia where the next day I had to get up early in the morning. I have always considered it a godsend, it is an excellent anxiolytic and it is very useful also for those suffering from sleep disorders, because it does not leave heaviness or numbness the next day, due to its short duration of action in the body. My average dosage is 20 drops (0.50 mg). What can I say, to me it is the best anxiolytic!",10,33
Xanax,"I have Poliaradiculoneuropathy (when polyneuropathy and polyradiculopathy occur together).  Xanax is not so great for general anxiety, but I appreciate this drug, since I discovered its off label use for my terrible neuropathy. It reduces my legs pain and stiffness by ca. 70% and set me free from being bedridden. Now I can walk several km with the help of crutches and feel more like human again. I am getting addicted to it, but I could care less.",7,24
Xanax,"3yrs on and off as needed.  Not sure why this is a popular recreational drug?  It really just make me feel normal again when I start getting high bp spikes from anxiety and panic attack symptoms.  It definitely works, no side effects that I have been aware of.",10,51
Xanax,I have been on xanax for 30 years and it worked great for my anxiety and panic attacks.  I am not addicted but it help with everything bothering me. Well my Dr.  just cut me off abruptly !  The withdraw is terrible.  I was willing to wean myself off of them but cut off.,10,43
Xanax,I have been on xanax for over five years. I am not addicted. I take them as prescribed. I don't drink and I have positive results. I have no side effects,10,47
Xanax,"I've taken xanax to help me sleep for several years. I try to take it as little as possible so I won't get addicted. It makes me tired, even at.25 so I don't take it during the day. Luckily, I don't suffer from panic attacks very often.  I probably take it a few times a month just before bed. It works better than it antihistamines although I frequently wake up after 6 hours which is all it seems to last. I have heard about it leading to Alzheimer's though. I'm afraid of that.",9,27
Xanax,"I have been on Xanax for about 20 years, 1mg for sleep. I am not addicted to it but dependent like a person with high blood pressure is dependent on meds., or diabetic dependent on insulin, or humans dependent on oxygen.   I have had no side reactions and am 78 years old.  It has saved my life.  Try not sleeping for a week and see what happens. You will be inside your worse nightmare Why the uproar over physical dependence, I do not know.  It must come from the Gov.",10,107
Xanax,"I have been using this drug for several years for my anxiety attacks, and it great. But anxiety has been getting worse and worse especially during work which causes heart stress (thanks so much anxiety..), so my doctor is now letting me take it during my 5-day work week. It works excellently. I am so much more calm and present at work. I will say I am a lot more lethargic, and that is noticeable. But otherwise I have no side effects, so I will continue with this treatment and I am so glad that it is so effective. The good outweighs the bad for me, but I will say that if you tend to be more dependent on drugs like these, I dont recommend it for you. I have no addiction to it and no withdrawal symptoms when go days without after taking it for multiple days in a row. So just be aware, and pay attention to your body. If you are struggling with learning the difference between wanting another dose and needing another dose, talk to your doctor.",10,41
Xanax,I have been taking xanax for  10 years. Through an alcohol addiction I drink while on  Xanax not a good idea If used as prescribed  It takes away my panic attacks. I couldn't even leave the house without.  It also helped me stop drinking 3 years sober now still on xanax 1 mg 3 times daily. Some days now I don't even take it . With proper self control it saved my life. Hands down. I  had a lot of stress since quitting drinking between family members dying. This last year has been   hard to say the least 2019 was probably the worst year of my life and I stayed sober through It. No more alcohol,10,71
Xanax,Suffered major depression and anxiety when my father died when I was 18 years of age. I constantly considered killing my self. Antidepressants and therapy had little effect on my outlook on life. But then I was prescribed Xanax. I learned to calm down and to actually take a look at my life. Just dont abuse the drug and it works wonders.,10,50
Xanax,"Well, I have mixed thoughts about Xanax. On one hand, it is a very fast acting drug, and seems to be more powerful than klonopin at the same dosage (0.5mg). On the other hand, it seems to have a very short time effect, with a more pronounced knock out effect. In short: at least for me klonopin works much better.  I stopped cold turkey (not the right thing to do, I know) and had no issues at all. I had taken it for over a year for panic.  Also, it seemed to boost my appetite beyond normal levels, but I leave this as an open question as to a plausible effect.",6,21
Xanax,"I have been having sleep issues for years.  At times its not too bad but lately it's been hard to fall a asleep. I also get up multiple times to urinate due to an enlarged prostate.  I'm 51.   My wife had some Xanax and she told me to try one before going to bed.  I used it the last 2 nights.  The pills are 0.5 mg. OMG, I slept like a BABY for the 2 nights and felt so refreshed.  I also only got up once to use the bathroom.   Most nights I get up almost every hour to urinate.  That wreaks my sleep. I will not take the pill every night but I may periodically. Too bad it's not safe to take for a long period of time.",10,22
Xanax,"Was prescribed Xanax .25 mg as needed about 9 months ago. After a few weeks I cut it back on my own to .125 as needed. Im averaging .1 mg a day. Im concerned about long term use,  ( is 9 months considered long term?) Withdrawal is another fear( does replacing Xanax with another drug make any sense?)  and mostly, the dizziness that I feel almost daily, especially when standing up or getting out of bed. Anyone have advice or personal experience that can help me? Im 62, with 3 widow maker stents, but otherwise in excellent health.",7,30
Xanax,"I have panic disorder, anxiety, some OCD.  Ive been on Xanax (1mg as needed which ends up being daily but usually only at night and then I take 2) for about 7 years.  I was originally prescribed it more than 20 years ago but kept it as a security blanket.  Ill never forget the first time I actually got the nerve to try it.   This is what normal people feel like??? , was my response.  I would keep my review at a 10 EXCEPT, now Im hearing LOTS of talk (and medical reviews) that it causes dementia/Alzheimers!!!  This is the ONLY drug that works for me and I feel I need to get off of it.  Scared and torn and would love a solution.",10,48
Xanax,Xanax takes away all the nervousness mind racing and anxiety while making me feel calm and content. Miracle drug to me,10,69
Xanax,I was prescribed 2mg Xanax 2 times a day for severe anxiety and insomnia this drug works amazing for sleeping issues as far as anxiety I just break a piece off and let it dissolve under my tongue (nasty taste) but takes anxiety away immediately. I'm so glad my psychiatrist put me on this medication for anxiety /panic attacks/insomnia I don't abuse it sometimes I even go days without having to even take it .... Its definitely a life saver to have though!!,10,55
Xanax,"I have severe OCD, with accompanying anxiety and debilitating insomnia.  Xanax helps me break thought loops.  I only take it a few times per week, almost exclusively at night, and rarely during the day when I'm hit with a paralyzing bout of obsessional thought.  I take  .125 mg (half a .25mg pill).  Surprisingly, that is enough to stop the ruminating and make me a little drowsy, and that adds up to falling asleep.  Sometimes I take it in the middle of the night to get back to sleep, but only if I don't have to get up early the next day and if I didn't take it to get to sleep that night in the first place.  The way I see it, if .125 to .25 mg stops working for me, it'll be time to move on and maybe revisit Xanax at a later date.  Having tried a great many different medications, I'm beginning to think rotating treatments is the way to go anyway, to prevent tolerance, addiction, and avoid long-term side effects/consequences.",9,35
Xanax,"l suffer panic and distress. doctor wrote  a prescription 0.25mg Xanax twice per day for me,  three weeks pasted. l feel very good.",10,23
Xanax,"I have awful, crippling anxiety that sometimes makes me spiral into holes of despair and this helps me out of them but my body just feels so weird I am not sure it's worth it sometimes TBH. My body (esp. my arms) feel really heavy...? I'm only on 0.5 mg and take it only in emergencies.",7,18
Xanax,Xanax really helped when the world felt like shaking due to anxiety . It changed my view of thought for the better.,9,32
Xanax,"Xanax saved me from having anxiety and panic attacks I just take one 2MG once a day,  it says to take it twice a day but I don't..just once 2MG a day",0,32
Xanax,"The first time my doctor gave me xanax I thought this is the best! I started with 1mg per day, then 2, and then 3. It made me feel so calm and more happy. But I realized after how addictive it is. Now I take Xanax up to 6mg per day because I feel is the only thing that helps me not having anxiety and panic attacks. Sometimes I just enjoy how it makes me feel. It has been very effective but I also think is dangerous. Because I don't care about the side effects but I am very scared of the thought of overdosing. I lie to people about how mg I take in a day.  Take care of your self, if you have depression. It is easily to get addicted because it gives you that empty feeling you might find pleasant.",8,43
Xanax,"Been on Xanax for almost 17 years for acute anxiety disorder. I also have a rare heart condition that I take meds for. Xanax was good at first but now after 17 years and up to a prescription of 6mg a day. Just came down from 8mg a day. Its messing with me. In the past few months Ive been experiencing what I call googly eyes followed by a headache. Ive told my Drs and none have an explanation. So I did a test myself. Took my heart meds as usual in the morning left out the Xanax. No googly eyes. Until I took one then there it was. Dizzy ,couldnt see straight had to lay down with a bad headache. Can you build up a bad dose in your body after taking so much for so long? Ive only been on the 8&amp;6 mg for about 5 years. I have a family and I know Im going to need in patient care to get off this stupid medicine. Also let me add yes I know Im addicted and dependent but Im scared and not sure if what to do but try to slowly ween myself off. Of course my dr is helping.",10,35

Xanax,"Saved my life from crippling anxiety! Only take it in SOS but lifesaver! No side effects whatsoever, apart from when I go to bed I fall asleep a bit faster.",10,54
Xanax,"I rated Xanax a 5 because yes at first it was a god send! I got an appetite became interested in daily activities again, gave me motivation and I once again had goals set for myself. However this drug is for short term use and that's it! I was on it for several years and when I became physically dependent on it what was prescribed to me was never enough! I not only was physically dependent but also addicted! It began to cause increased anxiety, irrational behavior, destructive actions, and really bad mood swings! I weaned myself off as soon as I realized it was causing the problems in my life! If you get on this medication don't stay on it for too long! Getting off of this medication was the hardest thing I have ever done in my whole life I am still struggling with it 2 years later!",5,78
Xanax,"I've been on Xanax for 25 years. Same 2 mg dose the entire time. It got added to my meds due to Childhood PTSD that would not allow me to calm down and sleep. This drug should not be used alone. Other meds should be in place. If you take this drug and need to continue increase the dosage amount, this drug may not be for you. You need a diagnosis from a psychiatrist to even get this drug. You will be monitored for a long time while on it. Monthly visits to the doctor for years and years. Once you can prove that you can take this medication responsibly you may find the rules relaxed a bit. You are not to drink on this drug. I have rarely had a drink for the last 25 years. A cocktail once in a blue moon.",10,45
Xanax,"I have had anxiety for many years. About 30. Not until 37 years old did it crush me. I started with Zoloft and buspurone. Then came the Xanax.  The first day I took one I felt like I have missed my life all these years. I looked at my wife and said the following.   Have I been an A-hole for the last 13 years?  She said yes.   You must really love me  She said yes again.  For the first time in my life I realized how much anxiety took over my life. I can literally feel the difference of me being that angry anxiety filled person.  Now, I take .5 every 2 days. I actually enjoy life. Before it was just there. Like a clouded mind just floating there. Not feeling or computing. When I take a Xanax, I feel alive. Happy. I look at my kids and I can actually enjoy them and literally feel the abundance of love I have for they. And that makes life so much better to live.",10,135
Xanax,"I did get terrible withdrawal when I tapered off xanax last year.  Now panic almost everyday.  Will ask for valium instead of xanax, cuz longer half-life means less withdrawal.  I'm so tired of being obsessive &amp; terrified without meds, and sleepy with meds.",7,38
Xanax,"I have no problem taking Xanax for sleep  for years..  I  am now  trying to get off of it - only in the fear that they won't be manufacturing it  for long, and doctors are  so reluctant to  prescribe it.   I'm scared I will have withdrawal effects.. .. so I have to do it very slow..  But  I truly   have no complaints taking    1 mg.. or  half  for sleep at night and for anxiety. Too bad  its abused and now known as  a bad drug..",10,54
Xanax,"This stuff is a godsend for my nighttime anxiety attacks. It acts quickly, getting me back to sleep, stopping the gremlins in my head, dead in their tracks. This may sound weird but xanax also seems to improve my vision, especially distance. I had noticed this also with Valium in the past. My eye muscles relax too instead of straining? Not complaining!",8,53
Xanax,"This is crazy what they are currently putting me through to get off of this FANTASTIC drug. I was prescribed this drug at the age of 17 after my brother died. Everyone on my maternal side since my great grandmother had been on this drug. I have been on xanax since i was 17. I now can live a normal life, go to school, get FANTASTIC grades am a mother of 2. I love my daily life till my doctor passed away... now I can not find a doctor to prescribe it. I do not abuse this drug and they have no reason to want to take me off of this drug. I have been great success from this drug. I wish i could find a psychologist that would continue to prescribe this medication when it really works successfully for myself. It is not fare that doctors are pressured to not perscribe this medication for those who need it. I am never going to leave my house and its going to take a toll on my children as well. Its just unfair. If anyone knows a psychiatrist in Philadelphia suburbs please let me know.",10,79
Xanax,"I suffered from severe separation anxiety, depression, panic attacks, PTSD, depersonalization. After trial and error with several medications my Dr. Prescribed me .5 xanax alprazolam. I was not driving my car for months prior I had to take 3 showers a day just to try and feel something. I felt like I was losing my mind like I was constantly afflicted by brain fog. I felt like a passenger in my own body. Now I can cope and actually get out of bed and clean and cook for my family. I don't know how or why I came about all the symptoms but if my Dr. Wouldn't have recommended this and prescribed it I would probably be dead. Alprazolam saved my life.",10,77
Xanax,"I have been taking this drug for 13 years and I can tell you without it , I would probably be a basketcase. I take it twice daily .05 mill for a total of 1 mg per day. I hear so much negative about this drug but for me it has been a lifesaver. I have acute anxiety disorder and depression. I also take 20 mg a day of Prozac and have little to no side effects accept for ED . I am almost 69 yrs old so just being able to function and continue to stay active is a big plus.",10,80
Xanax,"I have always had problems with social anxiety and depression  since I was a teenager. Every antidepressant I took made me feel worse. I started taking .25mg of Xanax  if needed  in my late 30s when I was diagnosed with essential tremors of the head. It made a dramatic difference in my life! It  helped immensely with my head tremors, social anxiety and even my depression!  I never abused it and it never became habit forming. I was on it for about 15 years  off and on.  Since then, my physician has retired and I am now not able to find a doctor who will prescribe it.  I dont understand why THIS drug is being so controlled when there is a whole country of alcoholics and booze still remains for sale openly in every grocery store or liquor store on every block! Alcohol caused thousands of deaths everyday from tragic car crashes and alcoholic liver failure.  Such a double standard.  Xanax has helped so many responsible people who take it correctly!",10,119
Xanax,"I will never take this medicine Xanax again one of my worst decision ever. Made me addicted couldn't get off it  and for 3 years had bad side effects increased panic sweat heart racing 3 seizures if i didn't take another dosage. I weaned myself  of Xanax with Lexapro, thank goodness I will never go back again worst drug ever!!!!!!",1,35
Xanax,The withdrawal from long term Xanax and other benzos is the longest and most agonizing experience you will ever go through. This is not an opinion its a fact. The withdrawals can last YEARS...yes years. Dont believe me? Take a good look online and start researching now. This drug is the absolute worst drug to get off for most people. Narcotic withdrawals pale in comparison. This is not a review...this is a warning.,1,64
Xanax,"I was taking Alprazolam. 5mg 3x a day for anxiety. Got off it for about a month because I was dizzy all the time. Doctor told me it wasn't from the Alprazolam but I think it is. I have had CT scans, MRI'S  MRA on my neck and head and they find nothing. Today is my last little dose of weaning off of it so I'm hoping the dizziness will stop here in a few weeks. I hate this drug and hasn't really done anything for me except make me dizzy. Won't use again. Anyone else have the dizziness?",1,30
Xanax,"I started Xanax in my 30s after my father was diagnosed with cancer and other life events started to pile up. It helped at the beginning. I could notice the difference in my anxiety and sleep patterns. However, a year or two went by and I found myself completely hooked. I had lost contact with friends and isolated from family, I left my job and spent most of the day at home. I truly had a 180 degree change in my social life, hobbies, and relationship. I spent all day at home watching TV and listening to music. I had no desire to deal with people or any type of social interaction. I found myself avoiding everything like going grocery shopping, driving, dealing with problems. Every time I tried getting off the Xanax it would backfire. It took months for me to stop taking Xanax and it has been 3 years without it. I lost many friends and family members and my relationship ended. I have slowly built myself up. Have a great job that keeps me busy, started running again and starting to make new friends.",2,41
Xanax,I was prescribed 0.5 for anxiety I have been taking half a tablet during day time if I have anxiety and .5 at night also if I need it. It does make me a little tired but the half seems to be good enough for me during daytime. After taking it I feel relief and the pressure on chest seems to settle quickly. Not all medicines agree with everyone but you have to keep trying until you find the right one.,8,42
Xanax,"I've had GAD since a child, losing a parent early. My first panic attack was at 12, not knowing why I was suddenly unable to breathe. After repeated traumatic experiences, I developed a social aversion that rapidly turned into severe agoraphobia. Without this life-saving drug, I would have never been able to have a recording career, find my spouse, and live a normal life. The days I am using this medication are 100x more productive and filled with joy...I'm sick of seeing only negative propaganda about Xanax. If you are a responsible adult who uses it properly, it is not harmful. If you use a heart medication each day, and it keeps you healthy, are you addicted to that? It's the same with anxiety. Mental health is just as serious as the physical. Just because some are abusing it, doesn't mean judge those who use it correctly. I appreciate everything this med has done for me!",10,171
Xanax,Its a rip off and I never will I ask for this again. Its a disgusting drunk feeling you get from this but it does calm you down and make you tired so thats why I gave it the stars. Anyone with anxiety use Ativan its so much cleaner and makes me feel completely normal. Strange how similar these drugs are but how different they effect me,6,18
Xanax,Id had taken Ativan prior to this and my experience wasnt that great with Xanax it made me feel really sedated and gave a drunk feeling and hangover the next day on only .5 kind of made me paranioid a little bit. I would highly recommend Ativan over Xanax as Ativan gives you a calm feeling better for anxiety at least for me and not that disgusting drunk feeling,7,11
Xanax,"I started with Xanax  for anxiety 30 years ago and have gradually increased. I used to take perhaps 0.25mg occasionally when I started, and now 30 years later, at age 71, I am up to three 0.5mg a day. I successfully fight to not take it more often and I almost always win the fight. When I don't, I take an extra 0.25mg or 0.5mg. Meanwhile without it I would not have had a successful college teaching career , traveled to Europe 28 times, produced a cable TV show, written 3 books, had hundreds of friends who love and respect me, and even worked out at the gym where I swim, walk, and work out with weights regularly. My current psychiatrist tells me frequently (I ask him every few months because I read terrible things) that I should not be concerned, that I am using it intelligently, and it helps me live a great and fantastic life filled with success, satisfaction, love and affection of so many people. My anxiety could be debilitating, but here I am living a great life.",10,151
Xanax,So I took Xanax at the hospital for my anxiety I had it for at least two days before going in and it didnt seem to really work it would make me go to bed for about 5-10 minutes and if wake up from anxiety again I would get no sleep and if I did Id wake up with anxiety again so I dont know if theres something wrong with me but I didnt feel better at all after I took a Xanax,1,10
Xanax,"Its really hard to rate this medication because there are two sides to it, short term and long term. Short term ( 20 minutes- 4 hours) it can feel like a life saver. It will calm you down, and if needed let the pill dissolve under your tongue (sublingually) for faster results. I. This case it gets a 10/10. You should not take this medication long term (3 months max) or overuse Xanax or any benzodiazepine. You will become dependent, you will become tolerated and getting off of this medication usually requires a medical detox because of the potential of death, definitely extreme discomfort and anxiety levels off the charts. It gets a 0/10 on that side. Taking too much or drinking on Xanax is potentially fatal . Also taking it long term effects both long and short term memory severely. I recommend you take this review seriously as I have been through all of this minus death and I dont wish my experience on anybody.",6,46
Xanax,"I suppose ONE reason why Xanax is so addictive is because it works, and it always reliably will. (There's also a high that you get at the higher doses, but it quickly fades with ongoing use.)  A significant problem with Xanax and all others benzos is the amotivational symptoms that results from chronic use. It certainly becomes increasingly hard to perform basic tasks, as one feels TOO relaxed to get anything done.  Even more serious of a problem with Xanax in particular is its rebound effects that make the symptoms WORSE than before. Because Xanax is so powerful but short-acting, within just a couple, or maybe a few, hours of taking it, one feels the URGENT, overwhelming need to take more. It can quickly form dependence. It also makes it difficult to sleep because you rebound in the middle of the night.",8,25
Xanax,"Its helps me function on a daily basis,  It is non drowsy.  It was made for me.  It's not addictive (for me) and I can take up to 3 1mg tablets per day.  I probably take one primarily at night.  Some days 2, once during the day and one at night. I take it for anxiety and depression.   I also take Endep at night.  I  feel almost normal!",9,31
Xanax,"Xanax does not help me with my anxiety, it only makes me tired, the same way everything else I tried has. I don't like the feeling of being high and I don't want to be tired and fall asleep. I have fear of going to work, but I'm trying to force myself to go, I have not been successful yet! I panic just talking about it and it's really ruining my life. I want to go to work and this is killing me. If anyone can help me with suggestions, medicines they've tried, a great psychiatrist or therapist if they worked.",1,13
Xanax,"Xanax saved my life when I suffered from anxiety and depression, figuratively and perhaps literally, too.  Not only did it help me sleep and stop my restless legs at night, it helped with constant severe anxiety AND it helped my depression, too.  I've been taking Xanax for 15 years.  I've never taken more than the prescribed amount, because I know it can be addictive AND I know that I won't be able to get it if I abuse it.  Frankly, it doesn't make me groggy, high, or anything other than normal.  It feels really great to just feel normal, and that is why it frightens and frustrates me when I have to change prescribers (of all my meds) and some object to the  Xanax.  I never share it, sell it, or use it other than prescribed.  I don't think I should feel pressure to stop it.  For me, it makes life tolerable, and I have a friend in San Diego who has the same experience with Xanax.",10,79
Xanax,"I have taken two  0.5 tabs at bedtime for over 7 years. Sometimes I can just take one. I don't like having to take a medication but it helps me sleep.  If I can get a decent nights sleep,  I feel I can take on the next day. This medication works great and my dosage hasn't been increased in all these years.",10,37
Xanax,This is a miracle drug for my anxiety. I plan on using it for 2 months.,10,27
Xanax,"I have taken it on and off but decided to quit awhile back when I felt mentally healthy again. With in a couple weeks stopped but I tapered to make it less intense and stocked up on natural stuff like teas. Things happen in life and here I am older, with very hard things to face and need a little help again. Im so shy about taking it as you should use caution and use it when you feel itll help detour a panic attack. Then currently I started getting gallstones and they cause nausea. I have a phobia with that and this helps me to eat till surgery. It helps in hard times in life. Also big moves stress me out and its helping this stressful period.  I trust myself to stop when things get normal around me again.",9,29
Xanax,Great drug.,10,30
Xanax,I've been on Xanax is for 26 years (and I am a certified Master pipe welder) I told my doctors that I've been for over 18 years that I have I am fine with it I've been diagnosed with severe anxiety. I do not want to take orbi I don't want to be taken off my Xanax but what can I do,10,28
Xanax,"Never had a problem, until I lost my insurance and had to change Doctor",10,22
Xanax,"I had been on paroxetine (Paxil) on and off for 15 years which worked great for treating generalized anxiety, depression, obsessive thinking, self-esteem, socialability. Without medication I feel like I'm going crazy with the nonstop chatter in my brain and constant worry and doubt.I have achieved so much while on paroxetine, but it eventually pooped out on me on the highest dose. For 2 months I have tried Lexapro now and I feel like it is just making things worse, but when I take a 0.25 Xanax I feel a lot better and the anxiety and constant worry, butterflies in stomach, dreadful feeling about life dissipates. The cloud over me lifts and I can actually feel positive emotions again. They say the benefits of Xanax only last a few hours which is why they can be so addictive, but I feel relief for about 24 hours on the smallest dose. It is making this transition in finding a new long-term solution for my anxiety and depression at least bearable on the days that I really need relief.",10,54
Xanax,This can be a good medication for many people but please be very cautious. I took it for about 5 years at 4mg per day. That is a relatively high dose. When I was ready to stop (which I did over a 2 week period and I don't recommend that) it took several months to really get back to myself. The interesting thing was that once I got through that period my anxiety and panic attacks stopped. They were at their worst while I took the medication.,4,26
Xanax,"I have tried all possible drugs to relieve anxiety. I practice meditation and few walks per week.  Xanax combined with trazodone, it is the only meds that make me normal. Without it, I am clumsy, fearful, afraid of life, paranoic sometimes and hypochondriac. I don't have tolerance problem, never asked to raise the dose in last 3 years.  It saved my life.",10,37
Xanax,Im scared I dont want to be on any medication but I had one panic attack plus I'm deaf but my hearing aids work up to a point  I just dont know what to do,10,10
Xanax,"Many have said that alprazolam is a life-saver.  I endorse that statement fully.  If you panic or become anxious you'll be unable to process thoughts properly which affects ALL your decisions, from making coffee in the morning to DRIVING your car to fulfilling your employment. Also, highly endorse taking the 0.5 mg before bed.   Wake refreshed by the benefit of uninterrupted sleep. Thirdly, I read from someone up above my post, and I've experienced this awful phenomenon too, so =&gt; DON'T share what prescriptions you take with anyone that is not a health professional.  You'll leave yourself open to criticism that is detrimental to you by non-doctors !   Xanax is an important, very helpful, prescription.  I'm sorry that some have the addiction gene (my terminology, not official).  They should definitely 'watch it' if they know themselves to have an addictive nature. I believe the 'script can still help them.  Sometimes I go for a few days without needing it and notice no withdrawal. Prescribed patient of 30 years.",0,68
Xanax,"I was first very fearful of taking any kind of medication. However, I eventually gave in &amp; I am very happy I did. Xanax is a very effective drug. However, you must be careful because this medication is a benzodiazepine &amp; it can be super addicting. Therefore, I personally only take it when I absolutely need it, mostly to sleep. This medication relaxes me, which makes me happy &amp; especially hungry. It really takes the anxiety right out of your stomach if that's where you hold it. I do notice since I've started on birth control it effects me differently, not bad just different.",0,19
Xanax,I have been on Xanax 8mgs a day for about 12 years. This pill saved my life.,10,32
Xanax,"This medication did nothing for me and I don't know if that was a good thing (since I didn't have any problems getting off of it) or if it was a bad thing (since it didn't help my anxiety at all). I have yet to find another person to whom this didn't work either. Overall I don't think this is worth the risk and even if you do take it, it only helps for a short period of time. Xanax will make anxiety levels go down but then once the medication wears off, your anxiety will spike higher than before, and the cycle continues.",1,26
Xanax,"I have been on xanax  since I was 22. (I am 39 now) I take it probably once or twice a year (yes year!)  At 22, I got diagnosed with anxiety disorder. I couldn't leave the house it was debilitating.  I was put on Prozac and told to take Xanax as needed only. So I started on 0.5 when I really really needed it. In the beginning I will say I took one about every week. Then Prozac kicked in and I was fine. I still get those moments where I can feel the panic attack coming, so I will pop one and I'm good to go. One bottle of 30 pills could last me years! But because they expire after 2 years, the doctor sends me for a fresh bottle. If taken responsibly,  this medication is great. No side effects for me and 0.5 mg is more than enough to take the edge off. I tried Valium and Ativan and it made me sick (nausea, vomiting,  hallucinations)  Xanax was the only one that was gentle for me. Keep in mind, everyone is different and will have different experiences.",10,38
Xanax,"Really helps instantly, just remember benzodiazipenes are very addictive. DO NOT USE ALCOHOL WHILE USING THIS!",10,16
Xanax,"I would rate this drug a 10/10 if it wasn't for the fast tolerance that you develop the more frequently you take it, and the very high risk of dependency, because it really works like magic and I felt no side effects. I tried my best to be careful while taking this, and although I definitely developed tolerance as I feel the lower dose (0.25 mg) does nothing for me, thankfully I didn't become dependent on it because I tried to minimize usage as much as possible. I would say Xanax can be like magic when you feel like you're going through debilitating anxiety and have frequent panic attacks, but it is a quick fix and should be used as a short-term treatment while finding a long-term treatment, because I can see how physical and psychological dependency can easily develop - if the issue isn't addressed and use is frequently continued. I'm currently taking an antidepressant which seriously made such a difference to my mental health, and now rarely need to take Xanax.",9,30
Xanax,Do not use these daily or you'll become addicted. They are great for the occasional anxiety as they work fast. But the half life is so very very short that you can easily start going into withdrawals after a few days. Be careful with this benzo!,9,35
Xanax,Best medication for anxiety. Kills anxiety instantly and makes you feel good. Its sedative but its worth it.,9,46
Xanax,"Jewels411.  No, you're not crazy.  I took Xanax 35 years. Yes it definitely helped. But warning, extremely addictive. It can ruin your life. I would recommend Valium. It will relieve your anxiety, yet doesn't have near the addictive traits. Good Luck.",4,27
Xanax,"Hey there I'm new to taking xanax and to this site. I'm 31 years old got married in June to a man who doesn't believe in anxiety so it makes me feel worse. I have been so scared to take it due to the fact I have taken stuff as a teen that made me feel really out of it and depressed. I have been to every dr and emergency room late at night, sick to my stomach, my chest feeling heavy and my head heavy and fuzzy, can't focus, dizzy, hot, tingling feeling numbness my face, my lips, my arms and everyone says it's anxiety or a panic attack. I feel so alone in this and I'm scared that there is something really wrong with me and the dr's are just not finding it. I feel hopeless I hope the xanax will help do something. I can't function in society and I'm tired of faking that I'm ok when I'm dying inside does anyone else feel like this or am I just crazy.",0,165
Xanax,I've had severe anxiety all of my life manifesting in different forms. I take Pristiq which works well for my generalized anxiety. I have horrible situational anxiety that make me sweat feverishly and it's so embarrassing. Xanax is a miracle for this. If I have an event going on that I know is going to take my anxiety over the edge I can take Xanax and it makes me totally comfortable and not sweat uncontrollably like I'm in a sauna. I don't take everyday. 1mg maybe 4x a week if needed. Its a shame how people can abuse this drug ( I don't get how) and promote it in rap music which gives it a terrible reputation. This ruins it for people who need it.,10,59
Xanax,"In my teens, I developed a fear of what I thought was nausea/vomiting. The feeling would overwhelm me to the point where my body shook sometimes. I was especially concerned this feeling would occur when I was somewhere I couldnt escape/where people would see me. I didnt eat much for two years. No one seemed to understand. Over time, the feeling seemed to subside, until it came back with vengeance at a job interview during college. My gyno was the first to prescribe me Xanax after I was diagnosed with pelvic muscle spasms. I didnt take it until that feeling crept up on me one night. Xanax made it subside almost immediately. It was then I realized I had been suffering with anxiety/panic all this time. I now take Xanax on occasion when my panic comes back, but even just knowing what this feeling is now has helped so much. If you have a similar  feeling  of fear that makes you feel frozen/helpless, dont suffer alone. There are ways to overcome it.",0,37
Xanax,"I was placed on 2 mg xanax 3 times daily in 2002 for anxiety panic disorder and my nightmare begun, sure this medication may seem to help you in the moment, but in reality it zaps your life away becoming so depended on it, all the warning signs about the wicked medication should alarm anyone, IT'S ALL true, after years of being co-depended on this medication, today I am free from it with little to NO help from doctors, if I could offer anyone help getting off I would, this medications effects of long term use out weights any benefits one may get from it. Trying to stop taking it is terrible, but with constant positive reinforcement it can be done, I did it, so can others.",4,48
Xanax,"I have a crippling phobia of needles,  as well as anxiety disorder. Ive refused crucial medical treatment such as IVs and vaccines for deadly diseases, and it put my life at risk. So my doctor prescribed Xanax. At first dose (1mg) it didnt make my mind any calmer, it just sedated my body so I couldnt run away, but my mind was just as desperate and terrified as usual. My dose for such visits is now 3mg and I am doing so much better!!!! 3mg is not healthy for most, but since I have a severe case it is necessary. Granted, I need assistance walking during the time Im on it, and it makes me blackout (I dont remember a thing from hours its in effect) but its worth it to be able to receive medical treatment. Please note that Xanax wont make your phobias any less scary in the moment, but it will help you get you through life. All in all I think Xanax saved my life.",10,27
Xanax,"Alprazolam is to me what glucose is to a diabetic. Im an educated contributing member of society but am genuinely a disabled person without this drug. My anxiety without this drug is so extreme that I spend every waking moment trying to relieve a fear state, cannot experience peace of any kind, laugh, smile, or function in any state outside of terror. CBT, meditation, positive thinking, hot showers, faith, etc. just do not work for the level of anxiety I have. I have tried many other drugs and classes of drugs because Im aware of what Xanax is, but this drug is the treatment for anxiety like mine. I would never abuse this drug, would never drink alcohol with it, and am highly aware of how it affects me. Xanax keeps me off disability and well, period.",10,100
Xanax,I have been using this medication for over 30 years. I don't see how anyone can abuse this drug. It works wonders for me when I need it. Especially when I stress out. It will calm you down quick. I take .25 as needed. Usually 2x a month. Sometimes 3. At night or right after work.,9,49
Xanax,"I've taken .25mg Xanax for sleep for 29 years, with Wellbutrin and Trazodone for Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety.  Never increased the dose, never needed to.

Xanax,"Dealing with anxiety, panic disorder and now agoraphobia. Xanax helps my symptoms well. Manage, well that's the Catch-22. I was put on 1 mg 3x daily.  I stopped for 9 mo. Started again recently but at much lower dose. I don't think I ever took 3 daily previously. I'm taking 1/2 or 0.5mg twice daily. But when needed I'll take a whole 1mg.  Problem is I notice this med produces an urgent type of anxiety on it's own if I don't take it 3x daily. Makes it hard to manage. Before present doc, I had been told by 2 different doctors they'd give me antihistamines. For Panic, anxiety? Seriously offended.  [Its like pain medication - the physician knows as soon as you ingest 1 pill : YOUR DEPENDENT. But they all blame the patient]   Wish I could find Long Acting - slow release Xanax.

Please don't take this awful drug.",8,29
Xanax,"From my experience with Xanax it ruins lives, period. Xanax was made for 14 day use for acute crisis but is grossly misprescribed. Xanax is more addictive than heroin and turns normal people into weird and angry shells of who they previously were. The drug causes the brain to stop producing chemicals it needs and the half life is so short that you go into withdrawal every time the drug  runs out  every 4 hours. You believes the feeling is  anxiety  and take another pill to treat it! However the feeling is just withdrawal. You will need more and more of the drug just to get the original effects and you will not really be aware of how youre acting. The longer you take the drug the worse it gets- and eventually the doctor who got you hooked on it will stop prescribing it. A safe way to get off of Xanax is the Ashton method  (Benzodiazepines How They Work &amp; How to Withdraw)- switching slowly from Xanax to Valium. Valium like a longer acting form of Xanax which then is easier to cut down on. I urge you never to start the drug.",1,58
Xanax,Been on Xanax for almost 10 years. It has saved my life and I mean that. I couldnt function from the severe anxiety that I would get everyday. I recently moved and my new psychiatrist wont prescribe it to me. I am just thankful I still have 3 more scripts I can fill. Hes trying to get me off it by putting me on Buspar. What a mess this drug is. I cant sleep and am nauseous all day long. Still take a low dose of my Xanax while on it but it scares me having to give up the only thing that has helped me over all theses years. People who abuse it have given it a horrible reputation and its not available for the responsible people that really need it.,10,79
Xanax,"I dont remember a time when I wasnt severely depressed &amp; anxious &amp; without obsessive thoughts.  I had severe emotional abuse/twisted mental abuse from my first memory at 3 until I was an adult. Im 43. There are times Ill go for days &amp; not need Xanax or take it. But when the panicking &amp; anxiety start I can take 5-6 mg (no, not .5 - actually 5) and finally function.  I only use it as needed although Ive been told I should take it daily.   Drug seekers have hurt people like me SO bad.  This is the only medication that works when I panic or feel anxiety to the point of wanting to die.  I have &amp; never will abuse it, but if I didnt have it I would for sure be dead.  Ive NEVER had a withdrawal feeling or problem at all.  But at that level of panic and obsession I am crippled.   My daily meds (esp the anafranil) work very well now to prevent this , but when I get triggered, its a wrap. So there ARE some people who arent abusers, &amp; who couldnt function without it.",10,54
Xanax,"This medication make me really happy with stress relief, anxiety relief and lot of energy, love it no side effects. First few days might cause drowsiness but then it goes away.",10,32
Xanax,"I had severe postpartum anxiety to the point of no sleep for 3 months, which made me lose touch with all reality. I couldnt take benzos as I was determined to breastfeed. Once I got through another bout of insomnia when I stopped breastfeeding I was suicidal from lack of sleep and panic/anxiety. I was put on xanax, .125 to .25 per day before bed. 4 years later I still have anxiety around sleep, so I take half the lowest dose 45 mins before bed. I struggle with sleep at times but I have not increased my dose over the 4 years and dont freak out or withdraw if I miss a dose. My doctor hired a new nurse  who seems bent on getting me off it, makes me plead my case to get refills. I dont understand this thinking-a low dose of Xanax forever is better than a strung out suicidal insomniac.  I have tried all SSRIs, hypnosis, counselling, meditation, CBTI for insomnia and hormone therapy. Nothing works as well as half a xanax 45 mins before bed. Its just reality for me.",9,46
Xanax,"Xanax has helped my anxiety and panic disorder for decades. Over the years, some doctors have tried to replace it with antidepressants which didnt end well for me. One antidepressant even made me feel suicidal since depression is the opposite of anxiety. My Xanax dosage has been tapered in half over the past year and this past July I had a seizure. I am 56 years old with tachycardia and have never abused my medications. I sure wish they hadnt started changing them again with my aging. I suffer anxiety and PTSD which I kept under control, living with a quality of life, enjoying my grandchildren, grocery shopping for myself living alone with my arthritis disability smiling through the pain. Not so much now, as my heart rate stays over 100 at rest so my GP referred me to a cardiologist. Im aware of my leaky valve from birth lol. Good luck all. This has been a good medication for me.",10,37
Xanax,"I have been on this medication for more than ten years and I have mixed feelings. It is VERY effective for anxiety (I have dissociative disorder), but there are many times I wish I didn't rely on it. I only take 0.5 x 4 per day, but if I stop taking it I will have a tonic-clonic seizure. I am at the mercy of my dr (who is wonderful). If a dr. decides not to prescribe it, I get very ill.  It's been wonderful for me, but consider the severe, yet common,  side effects for long term use.",6,16
Xanax,Xanax can be wonderful for anxiety. I am prescribed 0.5mg 4x a day but I dont take it most days. I do have anxiety every day and think about taking them but if at all possible I try not to take them. If I take them every day or too often I get depressed. But proper use helps me to actually get things done that I would not have the energy or  drive to get out of the house,8,26
Xanax,"I take a 0.5 mg pill about once or twice per week. I see a lot of people on here slamming the drug as exceedingly dangerous.  If you take it every day for a while, your brain will begin to alter itself in response to the constant abundance of the chemical. This means if you suddenly stop taking it, after several weeks of daily use, youre going to hate life for a while. It will take your brain a while to return to its previous state, from before you started taking the medication. I sometimes go weeks without taking it, and sometimes Ill take it 3 times in one week. I have no problems, and its highly effective.",10,33
Xanax,"Xanax is one of the hardest, if not the hardest drug to quit taking. Even harder than heroin according to my doctor. Was so hard for me for almost 3 months after using them everyday for 2 years. Will never take one of them again. They actually just takes away your anxiety while you are on them. Problem is that all of us are using them for a period. Then you get all the anxiety back again and the problem is now it is 5 x worse than what it was to begin with. Stopping my Xanax like I wanted to do the first day - just stop taking them - is dangerous my Doctor said that would not be possible, since I actually could die from it. So instead it is a slow painful reduction of dosage day after day. Just as warning take Valium, or in that range instead it is much less stress when you are quitting them",0,20
Xanax,"I've was diagnosed with chronic panic anxiety disorder almost 30 years ago and put on Xanax.  I also have horrific migraines, so I cannot take antidepressants.  I've taken 0.5mg 5 times a day for years with no problems working, thinking, or functioning.  Now the feds have decided that Xanax is addictive and my insurance company is questioning my doctor on filling my script.  I know all the dangers of tapering and cannot imagine what's going to happen to me.  Just the thought makes me nervous.  This form of anxiety runs in my family.",10,36
Xanax,I have been taking Xanax for a while now and it really controlled my anxiety.  I also have afib and anyone who has it knows how annoying  that can be. Now when I have afib I take a Xanax and calms it down I also spoke to several people who have afib and yes Xanax helps calm it down. So don't let any doctors tell you any different Xanax can be a wonder drug when used properly,10,39
Xanax,"The negative reviews on here about this med are coming from people who take it everyday. Folks, DO NOT take this medicine every day it's for occasional use only. It's like alcohol; having a drink once in a while here or there is fine but getting drunk all day every day is obviously not a good idea. Same thing with the Xanax. Taking it once in a while when required is fine but using it every day will give you horrible withdrawals. I have the XR version that I literally take once in a blue moon for emergency situations only. It works great. Basic rule of thumb: don't take it more than once per week and if you have to don't take it more than 2 days in a row.",9,37

I would have NEVER SUFFERED FROM A STROKE IN 2010 DUE TO MY CONDITIONS that I had no idea there was a word for what's wrong with me. This is a quick acting short shelf life in the system type of medicine so it's a here, now, gone feeling. The low doses are like a mini invisible hug, the 2 mgs help me sleep and dream of a better life and wake up to my Starbucks  feeling alert as the medicine did it's thing on my heart and mind.

Addiction to barbiturates in my mid forties was not part of the plan, so I stopped. Withdrawals were terrible. I also, experienced short term memory issues. I achieved safer results with anti-depressants, although they take a week or more to work they are not addictive.

My dosage varies, as I take it as needed. Some days I take 1mg and many days I take none at all. I probably average .25mg/day and it has been extremely beneficial to me. Even on my worst days I realize that taking more won't help, and I will just have to get through that day at a maximum of 1mg. For me, xanax has been a very helpful tool in my turbulent life and as things start to level out, my usage decreases.",10,49

I went in for my board exam for Respiratory care and I failed. During the end of my test My heart started racing,  chest pain. I was having a panic attack. I went to the doctor and I was prescribed Xanax. She told me to take 1/2 a pill 0.5 before my test and I did. During my test I felt calm, normal, fresh mind. I could think clearly. I wasnt anxious at all. I passed. Its been a great pill. I love it. But tonight I took 1/2 before bed and 30 minutes later I started crying. I am depressed too before starting pills.

Xanax is the only thing I've found that calms me down effectively. Depending on the situation it may take 0.25mg - 1.0mg to do the job. Because of it's addictive nature I don't take it every day, just in certain situations, maybe 3-4 times per year. I did have a situation recently where I took about 1.0mg every day for about 1 month.

If I would forget to take my meds in the morning, by 1:00 in the afternoon my head would start buzzing, I was agitated and in horrible shape. For years I was living in a fog. I was safely detoxed in the hospital for three days a little over a week ago. The doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Librium 3x day. This medication is mainly used for alcohol detox. It has worked wonders for me. It is another type of benzo, but for the first time in years I am happy and feel alive again. Please do not take Xanax lightly, it is an addictive viscous cycle that can make you feel worse in the long run.",5,10
Xanax,"I take xanax to help me sleep and I also take it for anxiety when needed. I haven't really been having problems with either sleep or anxiety for the last 8 months or so. So I have just been taking .25 mg (a half-dose for me) at bedtime. I have been taking xanax on and off for about 10 years. My experience with it has been nothing but positive. I have never had any negative side effects. It just calms me down a little bit and makes me feel feel a little more relaxed. I have never needed to take a bigger dose than .5 mg. It has not been addicting to me at all. But that is probably because I have rarely had to take it more than once a day. A few times when I had bad anxiety, I had to take it twice a day, but those times have been very rare.",10,33
Xanax,"I am prescribed up to 4mg a day and usually take 2 to 3 mg a day. I can't be given any SSRIs due to bad reactions on my maternal side of the family. Xanax just works for me. Was it overprescribed for years and given to people who had no business taking it? Yes. But this drug works wonders for some people. And it's not placebo. Am I dependent? Yes. Is my quality of life better on them? Yes. They don't make me sleepy or black out. In fact they give energy and on bad days motivation to get out of bed. I'm in good health, sleep 6 to 8 hours a day, and can interact with people better. Are they for everyone? NO. But they've helped me immensely.",0,85
Xanax,"Works excellent for anxiety. Have horrible social anxiety which I also take Zoloft for but xanax doesnt really help with it. Not knowing cause my Drs didnt tell me but after being on this a while and at a high dose (for me up to 3mg/day) if you dont take it everyday you feel like rubbish. Took me almost 2 years to figure this out so regardless if I need it or not I take maybe 1mg as a maintenance dose in the middle of the day. Greatly helps to not feel sick. I also take 30mg of Temazepam at night which I thought would cover me. But for the past 10 days my mood has been really bad, the worst in years and a couple mgs of Xanax greatly improves it but wouldnt recommend it since its not prescribed to take it that way",9,12
Xanax,"I was diagnosed with panic disorder and generalised anxiety disorder 24 years ago. I suffered for many years during that time and did not take any medication with the view that I would fix the issue naturally. I tried the natural way for years, avoidance behaviour became the norm and a way of coping. 9 years ago I was at tipping point in a very stressful job and finally was prescribed xanax (alprazolam) by a GP. For the first time since my teens when the anxiety began, I finally had relief. This medication has been a complete game changer for me and has improved my quality of life by 1000%. I have been taking 0.5 mg twice a day for the past 8 years and haven't had to increase the dosage. This medication is now sadly classified as a level 8 drug in Australia due to people who don't need it abusing the drug and ruining it for those who really need it. My psychiatrist is now trying to switch me to Ativan. I have been taking it for approximately a month now and it makes me feel depressed and empty and I have never had depression. I need 2 mg to ease my anxiety (double the dose of xanax) and it basically makes me feel like crap. Feeling incredibly overwhelmed and annoyed that this medication which has helped me so much will probably no longer be available in Australia.",10,31
Xanax,"STAY AWAY FROM XANAX. Please!! It will help you -- in the moment. But literally hours later, the rebound anxiety and insomnia will hit you and make you regret taking it at all in the first place. And before you know it you'll go from half a bar to multiple bars just to sleep at night. Oh, and the increased despersonalizion and dark thoughts are not potential side effects -- they are some of the many very real, consistently DIRECT EFFECTS of taking Xanax. Benzos should be used as rarely and as short-term as possible. Even in these cases the withdrawal is VERY real...it hurts just to live. Please. Take my word for it. I'm going through it for the TENTH time right now. ADDICTIVE",1,38
Xanax,"Xanax has been great for me! I have suffered horribly for years from GAD, PTSD, bipolar disorder, fibromyalgia... and many more health problems. It actually gives me energy to get things done, and allows for peace and tranquility. I'm prescribed 3mg per day and it also helps me sleep at night. I've had trouble sleeping for years, but this medication has helped so much.",10,39
Xanax,"Xanax has helped me with my activity's anxiety, I have a hard time going out being around people especially, when going places like the doctors, shopping, I have a hard time being around people or even just going outdoors also just going outside in general. I don't like being away from home that's my safe zone. I get scared when I here loud loud noises, I'm afraid people are going to hurt me or the ones I love, I am happy with my dogs and cats want to be left alone, Away from the rest of the world. here are only a few that I can trust, my mother, father, My Dave plus my children, plus my therapist Mark.",10,32
Xanax,"I got prescribed 0.5mg of Xanax, that I take once a day. My wife had just died. My anxiety was so bad I would not leave the house nor would I barely eat. It made me feel alive again and I'm able to function, and get out and socialize like a normal person again. I actually have a appetite now, and I'm getting good sleep again, which I haven't felt in a long time. Xanax really saved my life.",10,62
Xanax,"Been on xanax .05 for about two years. Doc put me on just an anti depressant for the first month didn't help ANY, went back and she saw how anxious I was and put me on xanax because I was honest with her and told her a friend gave me a few of hers and it helped my anxiety tons. I get thirty .05 a month and I can go days without them and some days a have to take two or three. Anyone with anxiety disorders know some days aren't easy at all. It helps me just knowing I have them. I still currently take celexa daily I don't know if it really helps my anxiety at all but the combo with the xanax seems to work. I know a lot of ppl don't wanna use pills but I'd much rather have medication than panic attacks.",0,51
Xanax,Dad always had some amount of general anxiety but managed it reasonably.  In approx 1982 he was prescribed Xanax after his Dad died unexpectedly and he was instructed to take X as needed.  He's been on and off X ever since then and has needed progressively more.  About 20 years ago he graduated to other medications including anti-depressants and at one point was on a combo that resulted in a nearly-successful suicide attempt.  He never had suicidal thoughts before or after that particular combo.  He's now old and his life is in ruins.  He takes X throughout the day but is at the max and cannot take more.  Please be aware once you start on these medications you're in it for life.  Dr's know this -- job security for them!,2,28
Xanax,Since my dad got sick and eventually passed away my anxiety depression and fears were just over whelming. I've been having so many intrusive thoughts since then. I had mild depression before he passed its been 5 years and its finally just has destroyed me. I finally went and got help two weeks ago and xanax not only completely calms me down it helps me focus on thing I need to focus on and not let my mind wonder with anxiety and weird thoughts. Miracle drug. Don't abuse it. Use when needed its amazing.,8,58
Xanax,I have severe anxiety I started out with 0.5 mg of xanex my Dr just upped it too 1 mg twice a day I have a very understanding Dr.  He makes sure I always have 6 months worth I am not addicted because I've gone days with out it,0,38
Xanax,I have been on SSRI's and benzos for probably 3 or 4 years. SSRI's for depression and on top of that benzos for anxiety and panic attacks. Was on ativan for 3 years and it eventually stopped working. Would take 2 0.5mg pills and it would not affect my anxiety at all. Psychiatrist switched me to xanax 0.5mg everyday as needed up to 3 pills a day. It actually works. It takes a few minutes and wipes away any panic attack and softens my anxiety. I am very careful though because I know it can be very addictive. I was clean off the ativan for months and had no withdrawls so I know I was not addicted to that. Have only been on the xanax a few months and I only take it AS NEEDED so not to get addicted.,10,30
Xanax,"Until yesterday, I was prescribed .5 mg. Alprazolam(xanax) for panic, anxiety and irregular sleep patterns.  I took them for four years. I went to my psychiatrist yesterday for my monthly suboxone appointment(6 yrs).  The same psychiatrist who prescribed my .5 mg.xanax.   I am taking suboxone for chronic pain issues from a MVA.  I had been on prescription oxycontin 60 mg, 2x's/d for 11 yrs. and that doctor retired...no doctor would prescribe a full opiate agonist and that was 5yrs. ago.   So I was told yesterday that he could no longer prescribed both xanax and suboxone due to state and federal guidelines.  This type of inappropriate prescribing is outrageous. Has anyone else come up against this?  I never abused either medications.",10,31
Xanax,"I was given an extremely low dosage of this, don't know if that was part of the problem but it didn't do anything for me good or bad.",1,12
Xanax,I'm a 19 year old girl and I've been diagnosed with Anxiety for a long time but never had an anxiety attack until now. My doctor prescribed me this medicine yesterday after I told her I had an anxiety attack 1 day ago. My heart was literally at a speed of 100 but she gave me medicine to slow it down. It really helped me sleep last night too. This medicine took me about 30-45 minutes to kick in and then it knocked me out and I was fast asleep.,10,27
Xanax,"Xanax is like putting a band-aid over a wound that needs stitches. This med helped take the edge off my anxiety and am thankful for it. It will NOT treat GAD properly because you'll be dependent with too many doses, but is a godsend for panic disorders. I still struggle with anxiety (anger, headaches, worrying, crazy thoughts). It helped me be able to sleep, socialize, not have panic attacks at work, great sex drive and I feel calm. I was prescribed 0.5mg twice a day, usually took less otherwise I'd be sleeping all day, only could go about a day without it then I need it again for anxiety. The biggest downside is that it makes me REALLY tired, lazy, poor memory sometimes. When mixed with alcohol I get very angry. Will be looking into SSRIs.",8,18
Xanax,Xanax is a medication that must be taken seriously and with precaution. This is not a game. Taking it when you don't need to will only create addiction and the withdrawal is worse than living with the actual anxiety. Please don't take this med unless you suffer from anxiety and you are having a panic attack. It works well in these situations but my advice is to stay away from it and only take it in an emergency. I prefer lorazepam. When you take lorazepam the withdrawal symptoms are more tolerable than xanax. Xanax is awesome but it can become Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. You can die from this or get a DUI if you are caught in a driving accident. This is serious.,7,27
Xanax,"I was given this after trying several other meds. My doctor gave me 2 mg bars. The yellow ones (generic) aren't bad and the white one isn't either, but them green ones will wipe you out. They are at least 40% stronger despite being the same strength. The use to be very expensive, but are only $5.56 for a 60 pill supply with my insurance ( which is bootleg Obama care).",10,14
Xanax,"The most efficacious and useful anxiolytic I have ever had. Fast acting and requiring three times a day (chronic) administration, but also, along with the recommended 4mg lorazepam IV when actually suffering an attack and a doc is present, by a long way the best acute remedy for anxiety and panic attack.",10,19
Xanax,"I have been taking Xanax 0.25 for less than four years to control anxiety mainly before sleep. It works really well until it does exactly opposite for its purpose, causing more anxiety and distress. I have been taking Xanax randomly only to relax me before sleep, say 3 times a month, 10 times a month and most of the time half of the 0.25. I noticed that overtime especially in the months I took it more often, the anxiety, the fast heart beats and confusion and strange muscle weakness were getting beyond tolerable. In few words, I would tell anyone there that NO ONE should even begin taking this very addictive Xanax. Better suffer through your difficulties than using Xanax to ease your anxiety and panic. The drug will take you to abyss.",2,27
Xanax,Anything that can get me back on track while I deal with my very occasional anxiety issues.  Xanax helped me out a lot 4.5 years ago and I am in need of it again.,10,14
Xanax,"I was extremely against Xanax because of knowing people who abused it, and being someone who will try homeopathic cures before using prescriptions. That said, it really helps me. I have anxiety I would describe as anywhere from mild- severe depending on the day, and week. But sometimes I get in these intensely anxious thought patterns, where I cannot let go, its terrible.Taking medication during these periods is a god-send. It allows me to return back to my normal non-anxious self. I rarely have noticed sleepiness as an effect of the medication- only when I was already sleepy before taking it. If you don't abuse your dose, it shouldn't cause you to feel out of it or have memory loss, if you truly suffer from anxiety. That's my experience",8,40
Xanax,"I'm 21 years old and this medication gave me my life back. I have social anxiety, hypochondria, and occasional panic attacks. I'd immediately become stiff and uptight at all social events as well as at school. It got so bad that it affected my grades. After I take a Xanax, the anxiety simply vanishes and it's replenished with relaxation, tranquility, and stability. All the scary, racing thoughts stop and I begin to think more logically and calmly. I take 0.5 mg five times a day as needed. Xanax is also wonderful for muscle spasms.",10,37
Xanax,"Any drug can get a bad wrap because of some people abusing it. A lot of doctors don't even like prescribing Xanax because they don't want their patients getting hooked. For me, I suffer from occasional anxiety attacks, and my prescription is as needed. Anxiety attacks can be VERY scary. There were a few times I literally thought I was gonna die, it was that bad. I even went to the ER once because I believed I was having a heart attack. They are different for different people. I use to smoke and drink a lot of coffee, so I think that's what screwed up my body chemistry. I don't drink caffeine or smoke anymore. All I know is that now that I have my Alprazolam (Xanax) in my pocket, I'm not as scared to go places. I can live my life again.",10,64
Xanax,"This medication is great for anxiety and panic attacks when used correctly. Make sure you don't abuse it or mix with any downers. It says it's used for short treatment but it can (if monitor correctly) be used for long term if your doctor, physician or psychiatrist thinks it right for you. I'm very thankful for this medication for it has work wonderfully on reducing anxiety and takes away my panic attacks. (This is my opinion)",10,26
Xanax,"I have been through many many years of anxiety. Couldn't drive a car, couldn't sit through a church service, torment. This drug helps me focus and function.  People abuse it but it's a Godsend for people with real issues. Not everyone is a drug addict that needs xanax. I am 50 and a female and my life's been limited since a trauma at childhood. I have post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety to severe limits.",10,54
Xanax,"Helps wth anxiety but makes me very sleepy, really can't take it if have a lot of work to do. I only take half a dose .",7,20
Xanax,"Xanax has saved my life. I have GAD, panic disorder, OCD, PTSD and major depressive disorder. This medication has made life worth living for me. I have been in therapy with a therapist, life coach and psychiatrist for 3-4 years now. I can tell you if the drug makes you drowsy or hungover, it's not for you. Also, the therapeutic dosage should not exceed 3 mg per day, ideally around 1 mg per day. As long as you stay in therapy and see your psychiatrist regularly you will not become addicted or whatever else people feel about this drug. IT WORKS!",10,39
Xanax,"While I found this medication to be effective for anxiety, the concentration &amp; memory loss were terrible and almost cost me my job.   I didn't really notice anything was wrong until I started my new job.  Training was a nightmare.  I couldn't focus long enough to learn anything new!    I was reading a short list of keywords and by the time I got to #3 I couldn't remember #1.  I couldn't pay attention long enough to read a book, or even a short article.  I couldn't remember people's names.  I had to write everything down.  I couldn't focus on anything anyone was telling me, I would just pretend like I understood.   Luckily I noticed something was wrong and stopped taking it about 2 months ago.  My memory and ability to focus have improved.",1,26
Xanax,My doctor prescribed 0.5 mg which I take half a tablet going to bed if that doesn't work I take the other half. Depends on how much sleep I need or how much anxiety I have. If I'm exhausted the medicine is great  I fall asleep and next thing I know I'm awake in the morning but it usually leaves a hangover which I hate. I try to deal with my anxiety holisticly but  sometimes that does not work. I think it all comes down to eating healthy and watching my sugar and carb and caffeine intake. Walking and doing stretches works for me but honestly  Having someone who really loves you and does not abuse you in anyway is the best answer but I don't think there's many people out there like that anymore.   Koliopin is a horrible dangerous drug.   All pharmaceuticals as far as I'm concerned are bad for us and then least we take it the better off we are.,7,21
Xanax,"Lost what I typed 3 times in a row!. Xanax is awful.  Completely blacked out, wasted all my fire wood cooking a terrible meal, ended up with food everywhere and half of it missing, and came to several hours later. The rest of these pills are in the bin. Worst drug experience of my life",2,11
Xanax,Used to treat panic symptoms of anxiety. Quite effective for me with little side effects,8,19
Xanax,"I previously said I don't sleep well and it affects my ever vigilant dogs who get up too.  After surgical menopause when I was 33 years old, (now 62) hormones and sleep changed.  I finally was prescribed Xanax 1 to 2 mg at night for sleep.. Perfect.  No side effects, no abuse.  Dogs don't follow me at 2:00 am any more ,only when time to sleep. Thanks.",10,36
Xanax,I was prescribed these for an onset of panic attacks that would spike my BP to 175 over 130. Taking these 0.5 mg pills did nothing but make me lose my short term memory. I still felt panicked and my BP would only drop slightly until I rode out the attack.,1,5
Xanax,"Ever since my hot flashes started I couldn't sleep..when I say, I couldn't sleep, I mean I spent 8 years with maybe 2-3 hours of sleep per night...I just tossed and turned, watched tv. My PC prescribed every sleep medication under the moon, nothing helped. I mean NO SLEEP FOR YEARS...ambien, lunesta, seroquil. Zolpidem. Then he suggested a psychiatrist thinking some other issue was causing my insomnia. I would actually look at my bed and dread getting into it because I knew how long the night would be.  Well, my  nut dr.  prescribed a few and none worked. lol finally she started me on Xanax. Let me tell you...I really don't care what addiction I might have, what risks there are...I can finally sleep and no after effects.  A God Send",0,78
Xanax,Please try a different benzo before this drug. It's a life ruiner. The effects are so strong and leave the body quickly it makes you crave more. Tolerance builds like crazy with this drug too. I suggest klonopin. It works great and lasts a lot longer. Withdrawal is horrible from Xanax. You can die from it. Also comes with severe memory loss while taking it.,2,27
Xanax,"Only med that has ever really worked for me. I've tried every holistic approach to treat my anxiety, taking a .25 takes the edge off like nothing else. I'm afraid to take meds but taking xanax doesn't make me nervous. I only take it when my anxiety and panic come back, sometimes I have it under control for long periods of time. I read a lot of negative things about becoming addicted and the withdrawal effects but most of us who really suffer hate taking meds. We rather get better with no drugs. It helps me calm down so I can think clearly and get through the day or night. Wanted to post something positive for those who are afraid to take it.",8,121
Xanax,"Doctor had me on Xanax three times a day to try and stop my anxiety depression from furthering. While Xanax is wonderful for anxiety, be careful, the withdrawal can be nasty if you don't get off it properly. Needless to say I get timid taking it now cause of that. However, it helps in times of crisis.",9,38
Xanax,I've been taking xanax for anxiety and its s life saver!! Works really well; always carry a bottle in my purse. The only cons are that it can make me sleepy at times and it has an unpleasant aftertaste.,9,39

Xanax,"Hello all, I'm 34 years old and have fibromyalgia and Anxiety.  I have taken all the anti-depressants out there and xanax is the only one that truly helped me.  I have been on xanax for the last 8 years of my life.  I am prescribed two 2 mgs a day.  I take it as needed, and often I split a 2 mg in half.  If I'm off work for a day, I will maybe take a quarter to half for the entire day.  Recently my regular doctor weaned me off of it, I thought I would be okay, instead I started having panic attacks every day.  They were so bad that even being around 1 or 2 friends, for a long period of time, I would almost lose my shit.  I had seven or eight 1 mg xanax left when I saw a psychiatrist, I told him what was happening and he wrote me a script instantly.",10,51
Xanax,"I live with PTSD, social anxiety, panic, depression (manic). I've had a rough life in the early years, and married young to a psycho. Then lost my first child. My life hasn't stopped taking as of today- I tend to hide away, in a literal sense. Locking all doors behind me. Recently the FDA marked Xanax a black label- (saying it's a killing drug with pain meds taken together) thanks to rich people and their drinking with meds, and those high profile dealers out there mixing fentenyl into simple drugs, and doctors prescribing 2mg Xanax pills several per day.., people like me get to be sick and be removed from 3 -1m tabs per day that were to help us be part of society- while we search for another medication to help us get there again..",6,48
Xanax,Thank you Xanax for the best sleep ever!,10,42
Xanax,"I suffer from emetophobia-related panic attacks and anxiety, and this drug is just a godsend. I try to reserve it until I really need it as I know that, based on my personality, I could pretty easily become dependent. If it wasn't for the issues with dependency and withdrawal it would be a ten out of ten for me. I will note that after I stopped using it semi-regularly, I became better at dealing with anxiety on my own so to speak, and experienced less anxiety overall as I improved my coping skills. Still, I'm really grateful for this medication and encourage other miserably anxious people out there to discuss it with their doctors. It really improved my life when I thought nothing could.",9,61
Xanax,"I suffer from complicated grief and PTSD, I lost my only child to severe mental illness almost six years ago. My anxiety is through the roof right now.  Psychiatrist prescribed Ativan but it does nothing really (.5 MG) compared to Alprazolam (generic for Xanax).  Even splitting a .5 MG pill helps me to stop frantic behaviors.  But this stuff is addictive, you have to be careful never to go over prescribed daily dose and I don't know how difficult it will be to stop this medication, if I ever decide to do that.",8,30
Xanax,"I have suffered from anxiety &amp; panic attacks since Kindergarten! I self medicated,w/alcohol  &amp; weed, until they became an issue,to say the least!

Xanax,I haven't seen a xanax in the US from a US pharmacy with the name brand xanax scored on the pill in over 20 years. these had no taste. Real xanax have a very distinct taste. and it never melted in my mouth. xanax always melt in my mouth within a few minutes. I've seen videos on youtube of people pressing them. My advice is. Get a prescription from a doctor and get them from the pharmacy because that wasn't the first time I saw these.. The streets are flooded with these  bars.,1,14
Xanax,"I've been on quite a few different kinds of medications for anxiety and depression, but I've never had a reaction quite like I did with this one. Within hours of taking it for the first time, I began to feel nauseous, drowsy, uncoordinated, shaky; my vision was blurry and I couldn't drive a car. These symptoms persisted until I stopped the medication. I tried it once or twice after stopping the first time, and the horrible symptoms came right back. I couldn't even do my work. If you have any sensitivities to this medication I would not recommend it. I'm no doctor, but even I know when a pill isn't worth the risk.",4,17

I weaned myself down very ,very slowly and got down to 1 mg daily at night, but then some negative events happened and I was going into a panic attack. I know this medication works, but I would not take it unless it is a must.",5,16
Xanax,"Xanax does feel like a miracle drug, but then addictive drugs always do at 1st. All is fine, for someone with anxiety there definitely does seem to be some kind of euphoria, because you feel like you can properly have jokes, interact socially, be yourself again e.t.c. It's only a band-aid, I know it's not an ideal world where everyone can get the best therapies e.t.c. but in truth it doesn't work forever and many people (such as myself) end up with inter-dose withdrawals and 'psychological dependence', (OMG I FORGOT TO PACK MY XANAX HOW WILL I COPE?). Compared to the withdrawals I experienced (no seizures thank god), the anxiety that made me go to the doc in the 1st place was very minor. I would advise use for no more than a month.",3,33
Xanax,Let's be honest guys if you have anxiety you know too well it's the only thing that helps. I've tried several others medications for my anxiety but non of them worked so well as xanax. I've tried Paxil Amitriptyline Zyprexa Celexa Seroquel. All of them were a waste of time. The only problem with xanax is that it is addictive and becomes really easily habit forming because it WORKS!,10,68

Xanax,"I am 64 and earlier in my life i never had any gad/panic attacks. Not scared of anything! Then my first panic attack. I was on a freeway far from home and alone. Out of the blue..the clamminess, heart rate through the roof, shakes etc. I pulled off the freeway to a parking lot. I got out and my knees buckled. I was terrified. It finally subsided somewhat and i finished the trip on back highways.  . Now my trigger is driving even though all my life i loved driving anywhere..long distances alone..no problem until this. When i got home (barely) my dr. recommended .5 mg xanax as needed. A miracle drug for me! It makes me feel normal! I do not take every day",10,74
Xanax,"I was prescribed Xanax in 1993 when I started college at age 35. Have Panic Disorder, anxiety disorder and PTSD. Dosage has always been .5-1 mg daily. I'm completely a different person with it!! No more stuttering, no more panic attacks and running out if class to hide.  I've never had to increase the dose since 1993. I could never gave gotten through 16 years of college without it!!",10,66
Xanax,"After being tried on Klonopin, and Ativan, my doctor put my on 90 1mg xanax.  I noticed that if I put it under my tongue, that it helps faster.  I noticed it didn't only help anxiety. Myoclonous decreases while on anxiety, and my seizures have decreased a little. I normally don't get an aura before a seizure. If I do, I quickly chew it up and melt it under my tongue. Within minutes, I calm down, and the aura will slow down most time time.  I do believe that this has aborted a seizure too. I can't stand to get out in public, my heart races, I feel this sense of panic, and then think, What if I have another seizure in public?. Feel much calmer on this medication.  It starts working within a few minutes, unlike Klonopin or Ativan.",10,39
Xanax,"Hi all! I was given this medicine for my anxiety, I took it for 1.5 months only. I want to advise people who take this medicine to stay clear because when doctor made dosage smaller before stopping, I began to have weird sensations, my body started to sweat and I began seeing aurora around people and objects on road and was fainting for the next three months. ER say I had grand mal seizure and need a neck surgery, it didnt feel like seizures I just felt like I was dreaming. In the ER they gave me the same medicine to treat seizure so I dont know what is wrong?? Why is this medication given if its so dangerous, I never felt like this before and was very fit athletic girl in sweden.",2,35
Xanax,This is truly a cure all!  As long as it's taken the right way and responsibly I see no problem with that whatsoever.,10,64
Xanax,"My doctor prescribed me Xanax after I got fired from my job for verbally assaulting a colleague. I also suffer from schizoaffective disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. Today, I felt like having a rage filled outburst at someone I do volunteer work with. I took a Xanax and within 30 minutes, I was happy and chatty and relaxed.",10,45
Xanax,I deal with an aniexty disorder. Where I fear anything that has anything to do with the Apocalypse or other things like bad things in the news or conspiracy theories. When I first tried Xanax. It blew my mind. Before it I wouldn't eat or sleep because I was so worried. Now I take it when I need to and it makes me focus on things at hand.,8,37
Xanax,"In 2001, I started feeling like I was having a heart attack twice a month.  I ended up in the ER &amp; was admitted.  I happen to be one of the lucky females who suffers from hormonal anxiety.  I was given all the tests possible, stayed overnight &amp; discharged with my first script of the smallest dose of xanax.  I have used it only AS NEEDED since then and to this day it still helps me at the smallest dose once a day.   I have gone through some very serious rough patches in my life which had me taking this, at most, 1.5 pills maybe four days in a row.  It works so well that I can't ever imagine taking it more often than needed ~ why would you want to mess up something that works??  The key is taking it as prescribed, just like any medication.",10,37
Xanax,I take Xanax as needed for anxiety or panic attacks and have for years. My Dr. prescribed as needed every 8 hours .25mg. It works great for me! I used to fear getting addicted but at times a year has passed and I have to discard the pills. It all depends on what is going on in my life and how I respond. I also am on Paxil 37.5 for anxiety which at time I still need additional coverage.  I am thankful my Dr. Was able to assist me lead a closer to normal life.,0,24
Xanax,"I urge anyone to start on the smallest dose as I was pleasantly surprised that a tiny nibble of 2mg worked amazingly quick and helped curtail a full blown attack.  I have taken a full 2 mg at once when panic attack was at worst. I simply fell asleep and awoke with same anxiety.  If I take the small dose as I feel the attack coming on, it just stops. I know everyone is different but I have always been within the mindset that the stronger the better with meds. That has not been the case with Zanax for me. I also keep in mind this is a med that your body will eventually need more of for equal benefit.  It's a miracle med for those who have unexplained fear. It has saved my marriage!",10,48
Xanax,"I've been taking this medicine for 7 years. I only take the1mg pill when I'm having a panic attack. Sometimes more than other times. For me it is a God sent. That horrible tightness in your chest, and shortness in breath is unbearable. However I can see how someone could get hooked on this drug.",10,33
Xanax,"Xanax saved me. Apprehensive about taking meds but broke down after it got so bad I didn't even want to take the covers off my head with my eyes clenched shut just fearing every day because I knew anxiety, fear of everything under the sun and panic attacks would rule my day. I was told I needed to be on long term anxiety drugs so I tried lexapro and ended up in the er with side effects so horrific I don't even want to think of it now. Xanax is basically a quick fix to calm the anxiety but it's the only thing I'm willing to take and over time I broke out of the nightmare I was living. I still have bouts of anxiety but as long as I have Xanax on hand I know I'll be ok. I never had any bad side effects except for being tired. Trade is worth it",10,36
Xanax,"Was prescribed xanax (alprazolam) for GAD. First few months were a godsend. After I became dependent on them, the doctor- apparently not understanding the slightest thing about dependence- upped the dosage several times. I noticed that my anxiety seemed to be getting worse and I was afraid to leave the house- a problem I had never had before. Took me a while to realize the elephant in the room- it was the anti-anxiety drugs! After withdrawing from the drugs- which fortunately was easy compared to the nightmare I have seen some people describe, I noticed I felt less anxious and in general, more alive. If you feel like your anxiety isn't improving after long term benzo use- the root of your problem may be the drugs themselves!",1,54
Xanax,"I was given xanax in the hospital when people at work thought I was having a heart attack. My anxiety shot up so bad, my heart rate was 170. Been on 2 mg a day ever since (this happen 2 months ago). I only take 1 1/2 mg a day &amp; it works for me.  I feel like I have control of my life again.  I have heard stories &amp; seen people on it who over take it but if you take it as prescribed,  it works.",10,44
Xanax,"I have taken Xanax for about 25 years but only as needed.  There are many years I never took any &amp; there are years I took it for a few weeks to help with my Anxiety, stress of having a child with a deadly disease &amp; the depression that ensues.  I usually take the .5mg &amp; cut it in half and only use it 1-2 times a day, occasionally 3 halves a day.  It soothes me &amp; helps my constantly chattering, negative mind take a break.  I have tried SSRIs &amp; have symptoms of being allergic to them, so can't take them, ie muscle twitching, rash &amp; itching.  So, Xanax is my only recourse.  I know it an be addictive so am very careful to take it only as needed, short courses, &amp; usually about half the amount the Dr. prescribes.  It has helped me greatly.",10,79
Xanax,"I started taking Xanax .25 mg for generalized anxiety over the past few days and it has helped me feel relaxed, less worried and happy also hasn't affected me with any crazy side effects. (Which I was afraid of happening) I was so scared to take them but my anxiety was getting out of control so I figured I would give it a try and see how my body handles it. I'm going to continue taking one a day since it seems to be helping a lot. I don't worry and I feel calm, the pill does wear off after a few hrs and takes about 20-30 mins to kick in but my dr says it's safe to take another one as needed. I'm also doing counseling too and it is very helpful as well. Definitely recommend this for anxiety!",10,64
Xanax,"For several years I have been prescribed 1mg to take up to 3 times per day - sometimes I take less, some days even none! But I find that Xanax does for me what adderall does for children suffering add. For some reason the drug helps me have precision focus, a clear mind, better communication, rapid fire thought processing, and motivation - just for starters. I don't expect to take it for the rest of my life, but I go thro prolonged periods of anxiety and antisocial behavior (will urinate in bottles in my room when at my worst). Glad  to know there are a few people who Experience the same effects  using Xanax as Maintenance.  It's been a life saver for me! Curious to understand why it has this off label effect on us select few.",10,61

Xanax,"Very helpful in reducing anxiety for me.  It is fast-acting, and it made a difference in me being able to keep up with my job.  Now, I'm on Klonopin though since the doctor said that it stays in the system longer for anxiety.  However, the fast relief of Xanax works very well when an immediate spike in anxiety happens.  The effects usually only last a few hours for me, and I can understand how it can be addictive for this reason, but it's been great for immediate panic symptoms and helpful with focusing.  I did not notice that drugged up, foggy feeling on a small dose of .5 mg-1 mg as needed.",10,42
Xanax,Xanax has really helped me with my anxiety and it's not habit forming to me. It helps me a lot!,10,52
Xanax,"I am on a 1mg dose of xanax on and off for about a year for imsonia, night panics and generalized anxienty. And I can say this is the best pill. Worked great for me. It helps me feel calm allday and relaxed during the night so I can get the sleep I need. Gives me energy during the day when I drink green tea early morning.",10,44
Xanax,"Man, there's nothing to say about xanax that hasn't been said. It does its job like nothing else. Works perfectly, but because of that, it's super addictive to people prone to anxiety and stress. Because it's the magic pill that makes it go away! That said, my experience with it has been mostly good, as I have never gone above 2mg and i try to keep myself at 1mg daily. This is a literal life saver for someone with severe anxiety.",10,67
Xanax,"My doctor started me on Xanax 0.5 mg almost 2 weeks ago. I've had  severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder since 2009. Along with everyday terrible body pains from the stress and anxiety  And I was only taking Zoloft. Since then. But the Zoloft stop working like it use to. I find the Xanax to help me some. And it suppresses my body pain as well. And I don't feel doped up. I still feel the strangeness, and unreal feelings from my anxiety. The situation doesn't matter. The anxiety grabs me when ever it wants too. But the Xanax take a little edge off. From 1-10. I'd say 6-7. For me that's good. Because my panic- anxiety is super scary.",0,39
Xanax,"I've been taking low dose .5mg xanax for a few years for social anxiety and occasional panic attacks. It's excellent. I take it as needed, which I like, it lets me feel more in control. I rarely take a full dose. It's very effective even in a lower dose. It just lets me keep anxiety under control so I can function well. I never notice any major fogginess or anything with it either unlike other benzos I've taken like ativan. Just in moderation. A little goes a long way. Absolutely great medication for anxiety and occasional severe panic attacks. It has completely helped me build my confidence up and get my life back!",10,80

Xanax,"I have been on Xanax 1mg TID since 2013. This has been a miracle drug for my anxiety. I also take Celexa 40mg daily in combination with Xanax. Within minutes of taking my prescription, I feel a tremendous amount of stress relief. I normally take 2 at bedtime and sleep straight through the night and never wake up groggy. I feel refreshed each morning, and get ready for work. 2 thumbs up for this medication. Those that abuse it, you give patients who truly suffer from anxiety and depression a bad name.",10,87
Xanax,"I had only taken Xanax a few times as needed and losing it (oops). Sometimes it works right away with calming me down and everything, but this one time I was a mess and it took a while to work.

Xanax,I began taking xanax at 1mg daily spread out over the day when diagnosed with Breast Cancer.  I have had it 3 times now so have been on this medication for 6 years.

Very beneficial for me but it took a long while to overcome the stigma. Life is to valuable to waste feeling bad.!!,10,74
Xanax,"I have GAD, PTSD, Adult ADD, Bi-polar &amp; crippling panic attacks aka Panic Disorder. I was diagnosed with panic disorder at the age of 7. It ruins my life. I took klonopin for 7 years threw middle and high school. It worked okay but I always felt like something else could work better. I have been on Prozac, cymbalta, latuda, visteril, lexapro, Effexor, amnitriptalyne, celexa, Paxil, lyrica, neurontin, depakote, seroquel and risperdal. Nothing EVER worked. I finally am on a routine of; 40mg Prozac, 25mg amnitriptalyne, 40mg adderall a day, .5mg klonopin 4X daily, .5mg of halcion for insomnia. My doc recently changed me to 1mg Xanax 3X daily and it has been a lifesaver. I don't feel like a zombie and my mood has evened out!! Love it so much.",9,51
Xanax,I started taking this medication since I was 18 years old on and off. Let me put it in simple terms it is highly addictive. Yes it cured my anxiety but temporary only as long as I was on it. Miss a day and you want to crwal out of your own skin. The withdrawls are horrendous. Xanax just masks the problem. As soon as I got back on it my brain just wants it and thats all I think about. Valarian root is healthier and natural think twice before taking Xanax. Go for natural products if you can.,5,42
Xanax,"I get anxiety attacks with nausea (GAD diagnosed) and use half a .25 tablet during an attack. I'm pretty drug sensitive and also leery of overuse. I'm way under recommended dosage of one full .25 tab every six hours, but it takes the edge off my rushing thoughts of worry at half of one every 12-16 hours as needed. I was without anxiety attacks for 7 years and had a very old prescription that I used when my attacks returned. FDA has to list an expiration date but 80-90% of the drug was still active.",8,21
Xanax,"I've been struggling with severe anxiety and depression since I was a child. I've tried everything for anxiety: lexapro, Celexa, Effexor XR, Prozac, and Xanax. It's been the only medication that has really saved my life from this illness. Otherwise, if I don't take it, I won't be able work or live. I know that there is so much stigma about how it's addicting and it's abused. If you genuinely have a serious anxiety disorder, don't focus on the stigma. Take them! Or try to live the severe anxiety. You sort of have to pick your poison. I have never abused xanax. I started taking Klonopin for about a year, and was switched to xanax. I've always taken my medicine as prescribed. Right now, I'm taking .25 mg and it does wonders for me.",10,40
Xanax,"Way too addictive. Very expensive in my country, and gives me extreme vivid dreams/nightmares. But the mellow feeling is nice after a panic attack. Stops dead on track panic, and almost any emotional crisis. But I prefer to stay away. I changed to Klonopin.",6,19
Xanax,"I started out Valium for about 20 years 10 mg x 4 a day. Used for anxiety and sleep. It worked was a comfort to know most of the time used 2 per day so I always had extra. I think knowing I had extras help almost as much. Then Dr changed prescription to alprazolam 2 mg tablets 4 times a day, some heavy difference, at first it worked well . In the beginning I felt it 30 minutes after I took it and only needed 2 per day, now I'm at 4 per day that's 8 mgs and I don't feel it , I don't know about withdrawals but I hear it's pretty hard to get off and I've been on them for 30 years. Not sure what to expect but think I would feel more alert and energetic too",8,21
Xanax,"I've just switched to Klonopin from being on Xanax for almost 11 years. It worked WONDERS for me. I never abused it and take it responsibly, but I did develop a tolerance to it after so long on it. One of the best things about Xanax is that it kicks in pretty quickly, which is a must for panic attacks. It's very hard for me to let Xanax go because it's the only thing that really worked for my anxiety and panic attacks.",9,36
Xanax,"Used for 6 weeks to treat muscle spasms and phobia. After asking my doctor to wean me off we followed a regimen, and it was the worst withdrawal I have ever experienced in my whole life, even worse than things that I've taken in the past. I suffered temporal epileptic seizures for 3 days, and was staring at the door for an hour before my girlfriend smacked me to wake me up. 6 days later I suffered two consecutive grand mal seizures that broke my skull and nose. I had never history of seizures, brain MRI   EEGs done last year came out clear and crystal, and this medicine lowered my threshold so much, 6 months after I stopped it I am not the same, I am not the same anymore. Please be careful and think ten times before you decide to drop it.",3,32
Xanax,"My psychiatrist prescribes me 15 Xanax 0.5mg per month. I have generalized anxiety disorder and depression, and am on other meds for that; Xanax is only for extra-stressful situations. It is incredibly effective. Within minutes of taking it, I am much calmer. I notice no side effects whatsoever.",10,27
Xanax,"I've used Xanax twice in my life--once when one of my children died and later when I was divorced. The drug works as advertised, relieving anxiety in an extremely short time. 12 years ago I was prescribed 0.5 mg three times a day and it really worked. However, it is very easy to get comfortable taking these. I stopped cold turkey after about a month with no withdrawal, but I could just have easily become very dependent. It's a great medication if you use restraint and only take it when necessary. My current doctor tells me that he tells his patients that 3 0.5 mg tablets is the maximum they should take every week. It's great but be careful!",0,40
Xanax,"I have generalized anxiety disorder and several other mental illnesses, so I am on a combination of medications. Xanax is one of the best of the bunch. I only get fifteen 0.5mg pills per month, for use only in stressful situations. Works like a charm every time. Within fifteen minutes my anxiety and panic symptoms are well under control. No side effects whatsoever. I know the danger of addiction is very real, but as long as I use my Xanax sparingly, I see no reason to ever stop taking it. I also take Tenormin, Neurontin, Ambien, Buspar, and Remeron.",10,8
Xanax,"I have been on Xanax for about 30 years now. I have suffered with anxiety since I was a child and depression later in life. I started out only taking 0.5 mg a day, even going for periods of time without taking it at all, and then over the past 15 years I have graduated to only 1.5 mg a day. I feel no need for an increase. I suffer with all the usual anxiety symptoms, but one symptom that is most annoying is the choking sensation I feel in my throat. I believe I carry my stress and worries there. When I take Xanax, it takes this terrible feeling away. I find it extremely difficult to get a doctor to prescribe me this medicine as I moved to another state. The people who abuse this drug make it extremely difficult for those of us who need it.",10,80
Xanax,"Hello everybody.  I'm only giving Xanax a 1 out of 10 because it doesn't seem to have any effect on me.  I've been getting it every month for a few years.  I started it back when, after taking Paxil for a decade, it started to decrease its effectiveness and my anxiety and panic attacks were beginning to re-appear.  My psych switched me to Effexor, and while we were figuring out the best dose in combination with Buspar, I was desperate to have a fast-acting solution to the panic when I felt it coming on.  He gave me Xanax, but it didn't help with the overwhelming anxiety unless I took a few of them, and even then the improvement was minimal to moderate.  When I found the magic dosage amount with the Effexor my anxiety all but disappeared..",1,13
Xanax,"I started on Xanax after the birth of my second child for post partum anxiety. I used Ativan after my first baby but my new doctor wanted me to try Xanax. I thought it worked great at first. .25 my 4 x a day. Most days I only took 2 or 3. My baby developed colic issues and my husband was working 60 -70 hours a week so I had no help and was going crazy from no sleep and endless hours of non-stop crying so they upped my dose to .5 mg 3 x a day. Things calmed down around 3 months so I tried to cut back down but ended up with severe panic attacks and shaking, etc. Even when I take my regular dose on time I am still struggling with increased heart rate, shakiness, irritability, etc. Hoping to switch meds or something at my next appointment.",5,22
Xanax,I started taking Xanax over ten years ago for my anxiety. I started with .5 mg twice a day and ended up at .5 mg every 4 hours and still felling like I needed more as I was addicted. I had one heck of a time weaning off. I now take 1/2 of a .25 mg tablet every 3 to 4 hours when needed for my tinnitus. It works to lessen the anxiety caused by the constant ringing in my ears and I try some days to take it only once or twice. It has worked great for me but I suggest being very conservative with your dosing because it is very easy to build a tolerance and form an addiction.,10,21
Xanax,"I suffer from moderate, sometimes severe anxiety. General life stress, such as my job (bad bosses), my kids arguing over any &amp; everything, etc... I've been on Xanax (alprozolam) for about 2 years on &amp; off.

All typical symptoms - racing thoughts, palpitations, high blood pressure, dizzines, fear, choking feeling, chest tightness, fear of death and many other unbearable things which happens when anxiety becomes uncontrollable! Over the years I have had my good days and my bad days. Sometimes to a point where I don't want to live anymore, but then comes good days and to live is the thing I want the most. For those dark moments when close to panic xanax has really helped me! It gets me a bit calmer straight away, and then I can start breathing excercise and other little things which help to calm down. Without xanax I honestly wouldn't know what to do!",10,54
Xanax,xanax forums are full of how xanax can  be so strong for some people. to me it was like a sledgehammer over my head.

Xanax,"I've been suffering from General Anxiety Disorder for over 30 years.  I was on Lexapro which was controlling my anxiety wonderfully.  I was laid of from my job after 28 years working there.  I then found a new job but because it was change and new I had a massive panic/anxiety attack and quit the job after 3 days.  My psychiatrist then prescribed Xanax along with the Lexapro.  I was taking 40 mg of Lexapro and .75mg of Xanax daily, the combination has worked for the last 6 years.  However now I have another new job and had another massive panic/anxiety attack.  The combination of Lexapro and Xanax is no longer working.  I am now trying 20mg of Brintellix and 3mg of Chlonopin.  I'm hoping this works in order to keep my job.",7,6
Xanax,"I've always suffer with anxiety, but I've been able to control it. I've been out of work for 3 weeks, with a phobia of going back, because I had a panic attack, &amp; I was exposed, and people were watching. My secret was out. Rewind - 3 weeks ago I had a kidney infection, I was in the hospital for 5 days, home for 5 days, then went directly back to a stressful job. That's where it happened the attack.. people were surrounding me and causing me more stress, I was put back in the hospital. I'm now on buspar, and xanax. Buspar I have my negative thoughts on that, not sure it's helping or not dizzy spells. But the Xanax does help with the anxiety. It makes me super sleepy and groggy. I'm seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, pray 4 me",8,36
Xanax,"Xanax simply stops to work when taken too long on a daily basis. At that point, one reaches tolerance, and the medication is simply no longer effective at that dose. Many psychiatrists tend to keep prescribing Xanax and other benzodiazepines at this point (strong, addictive tranquilizers that lead to dementia and Alzheimer's) as maintenance meds. It is then up to you to realize how bad they are and wean yourself off them, going through years and years of dangerous withdrawal. The best solution is don't even start! XANAX: NOT EVEN ONE!",1,26

I have been taking it for almost a year now, on and off, 0.5 if I feel very anxious before going to bed. Yes withdrawals can be bad, but don't listen to all the bad things people say when going off, if you need it you take it.. My mother has been on this med for 10 years as prescribed. If you don't abuse it. You have no reason to be scared. Cheers A!",10,62
Xanax,"Thankfully I only took this med for a few weeks and at the lowest dose possible. I was taking .25 mg 2-3 times a day for a few weeks until my long term anxiety medication started to kick in. This medication truly does help for extreme anxiety and panic attacks but should only be used short-term. The use of this medication for any longer than a month on a daily basis is a recipe for disaster, this drug can be very addicting and is really hard to come off after long-time use. Luckily I researched this drug and knew this shortly after taking it so I was aware, because the doctors never informed me of the risks.",4,35

Coming off the xanax was the hardest thing I've ever done.  I had to force myself to work and keep my job. I had good days and bad days (more bad than good). My symptoms were crazy. No sleep, headaches, shakes, twitching, pain everywhere, memory problems. If I knew how hard it is to come off benzo's, I never would have touched it. Short term use= ok. Stressful event=ok. If this helps one person, then yay. Please be careful! Don't end up detoxing off of a benzo and going thru hell for weeks or months. Research this med. Not fun!",1,52
Xanax,"I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Xanax is the only drug I've found that works to alleviate the symptoms. I take .25mg no more than twice a week and within 20 minutes I feel calm and relaxed. Combine it with yoga and meditation and all your worries are gone. I like to take a .25mg pill and immediately do some yoga and meditate for 20 minutes. By the time you're done meditating you'll feel great for a couple hours. It helps just knowing the pill is there if I want it. I actually find that I take it much less than twice a week, only 1 or 2 times a month if that. I have no other side effects that I notice.",9,45
Xanax,I've been on and off Xanax for years! I've only always took 1/2 of 0.25mg to take the edge off when I felt my anxiety coming on and if I knew I was going to do something out of my comfort zone! It has helped me tremendously. I concentrate better and it actually helps my stuttering. I'm a firefighter/paramedic and I'm constantly dealing with stressful situations! I love my job and never could have done it without Xanax. I hate that it gets a bad wrap because people abuse it! I have never even come close to abusing it and use it for what it's for! Throughout the years I've tried all other anti anxiety medications and Xanax is the only one that helped me! It's almost like I have a chemical imbalance and Xanax corrects it!,10,68
Xanax,"This pill works miracles for me. It is completely effective against all of my anxiety. It also makes me feel less OCD. I no longer obsess over thoughts or worry while I am on this. Xanax unleashes my creativity. I play guitar, write music and draw a lot. I used to do all these things but have thought I lost interest because I had no inspiration. I have no side effects except some memory loss and tiredness. I wish my doctor would up my prescription, I am on 2 mg a day and for the past nine months I have always finished my prescription in 1 - 2 weeks. But this does well for keeping tolerance low and avoiding addiction and dependence. I am on it for 2 weeks and then off until my refill.",10,30
Xanax,"Xanax has given me my life back. I suffer from severe anxiety a few times a year, for no reason. I've been given other Benzos that leave me feeling like a zombie. I can take a tiny amount (and I'm talking 1/2 0.25) of Xanax and it calms me down enough to enjoy life.",10,49
Xanax,"I like to think of this as headache medicine. Take only when you have one. This medicine should be used in emergencies only. It is not for taking everyday. For that I recommend something that has a longer shelf-life-that takes longer to break down, like Klonopin. Because of Xanax short wait time and short shelf-life, it can make you feel like an addict. If you forget a dose, in less than 4 hrs you can experience WORSE symptoms of anxiety because they come without warning or provocation. Instant panic attacks, inability to think or work, etc. However, as a panic attack reducer or for the instant release of an intense anxiety-related event, I do highly recommend it.",8,36
Xanax,Do not use if you have acute anxiety. I've had lifelong daily anxiety and depression that has never gone away. I ended up dropping out of school because I couldn't sit still without having a full blown panic attack shaking. My head spins all day and my anxiety causes me migraines. I've tried yoga meditation and all natural remedies. I've come to terms with the fact it is genetic. I didn't know xanax existed. I've tried all antidepressants and they messed me up pretty bad. But I do have a very high tolerance to this medicine. I hate that its addicting because its the only thing that makes me feel normal and able to live my life happy.,10,48
Xanax,"I had anxiety that would tighten my muscles so tensely, especially in my jaw, my neck, my throat and between my shoulders. My doctor prescribed me a small dose as needed. I wish I'd known that this is what I needed. I felt such relief, my thoughts and muscles relaxed and the next day I felt like a million bucks.  I'm aware that there are some addictive problems for some people, happily after that one night of relaxation its like I was freed from a tormenting chamber and I didn't feel need for more. I have it on hand and have used it a couple times, but have felt nothing of the intense pain I'd known before. I can think more clearly just from those few nights/days of relief in the three months I've had it.",10,45
Xanax,"This drug literally saved my life. Before I started taking it, there was no quality of life left. I would get so nervous around people I couldn't go out into public at all, had severe panic attacks all of the time... I've dealt with this my entire life, and it took me 17 years being put on every anti depressant/mood stabilizer/even anti psych meds except anti anxiety meds (because doctors are too afraid to prescribe them...we have a lot of junkies here) I finally found a doctor who understands me. I take 1mg xanax 3 times a day and 1,200 mg of lithium a day. This medication has changed my life. I no longer struggle with my life, I feel like for the first time I have total control and it feels great.",10,47
Xanax,"Xanax is a great medicine that has been under a lot of flack recently because of irresponsible individuals who give it a bad name. I have been taking it for over two years now in an on/off fashion and sometimes for a few months at a time; however, I always take a few days every week to flush it out. My anxiety issues stem from a traumatic childhood making me miss out on a lot of GREAT opportunities throughout life, opportunities that Xanax is helping me take advantage of today. I am a very active male, I run and lift regularly and what I noticed about Xanax from the get go is that I had an extremely high tolerance to it.  I take 1.5mg of Xanax and .1mg of Clonidine due to this fact - WARNING -clonidine has bad side effects when stopped cold",8,33
Xanax,"Xanax is amazing! In 20 minutes it will completely take away all of your anxiety and/ or problems and everything will be ok. Life goes on! The only problem is that Xanax has such a short half life, that in 6 hours it goes away, and your brain wants more. If you take it daily watch out!  That little pill can ruin your life.  In prison they will only give med's to people detoxing from alcohol or benzo's.  Bc it can kill you! Short term, stressful event like flying or giving a speech or a panic attack- will do you good.  Try not taking your Xanax for a few days and see how you feel?  Or run out of your prescription a few days early. Let me say..its not fun.  Please be responsible and try meditation or working out.  Stay away from alcohol/stims",5,30
Xanax,"I was prescribed this med because I lost my dad very suddenly recently and suffered my first full blown panic / anxiety attack . The attack itself was the usual numbness and tingling sensation . Hard time breathing and impending doom thoughts . I was told to take on a as needed basis so that's what I did . I started to have the strangest things happening to my body , flu like symptoms with hot and cold flashes and pain ALL OVER! My usually high blood pressure kept falling and I was dizzy and lightheaded . My doctor attributes it to anxiety and directed me to take more ! So we upped my dose and OMG the pain was worse !! Now I know I might just be sensitive to this drug but my friend had the exact same experience with it . So beware !",5,19
Xanax,"I have severe anxiety and at times, I can't even hold still. I completely avoid going out due to the severity of it.  Tried 1mg of xanax under the tongue, and within ten minutes, I could feel the anxiety getting better. Zero negative side effects.",10,45
Xanax,I have had PTSD and anxiety disorder for about 15 years.  I felt like I was  falling off of a building and at night time I would have bad nightmares from past things. This is the only things that I can take that relieves it without making me tired in the day time.  I haven't had to raise my dose in the last 6 years I have taken it.  Actually I take the generic form alprazolam.,10,53
Xanax,Hello everyone out there reading this.  I started taking xanax for anxiety( a 2mg bar at night for sleep to turn my brain off at night). Worked my way up to 2 2mg bars a night for sleep/anxiety.  BRAIN FOG set in. MEMORY LOSS like I was going crazy.  BE CAREFUL this med (and all benzo's)  are for short term use ONLY!!!.  Tried to taper myself off and couldn't.  I went to a detox facility (Hospital) and detoxed properly. Was a horrible experience.  I was stuck in a hospital with heroine/alcoholics for a week. If your reading this BE CAREFUL. This med is for short term use.,1,38
Xanax,"I've been on this for 15 years. Started out on .25mg daily, now I'm at 1mg 4x daily.  This truly does help tremendously, especially when,having a panic attack. Just please know that if you try and stop it, please see a Dr! You get really sick, I have never felt that bad in my life...I felt like I was dying. You need to properly tapered off.  This medicine is great but also has serious mental and physical side effects, especially when used for long time periods.",10,55
Xanax,"I live in the UK where it is virtually impossible to get Xanax (or any benzodiazepine) so I am very lucky to have found a good doctor to prescribe it. I am 25 years old and the last 14 years of my life were a living hell. I have BPD and a very severe anxiety disorder that left me having multiple daily panic attacks, breakdowns and even suicide attempts. Every doctor told me in the UK we get talking therapy and an SSRI for anxiety, but never benzo's. So I suffered on for years and years until 4 months ago I found a Dr who prescribed me Xanax (Alprazolam) 0.5mg 3 times a day (1mg if needed) and it is a miracle drug to me. For the first time in my life, I live without the constant, crippling anxiety. I HIGHLY recommend this med.",10,62
Xanax,"Truly a miracle pill! Starting have severe anxiety attacks out of nowhere (heart palpation, numbness in arms and legs, dizzy, tremors) and with 15 to 20 mins I feel normal again! I would advise to only take when desperately need to because I can see how they can become addictive! I take .5mg but will start to cut that in half a lower dosage is always better if it works. I have only been taking for one week, so far so good, and no side effects to report.",10,35
Xanax,"I have been on every medication out there to help with my anxiety,/depression.  I was taking effexor which worked at first but I noticed that my head was just filled with unnecessary garbage to say the least.  My Dr took me off of the effexor and replaced it with brintellix and saphris which really helped my moods and depression.  But my anxiety was still affecting me to the point I thought I was having a stroke.  He prescribed my 1 mg of Xanax 3 times a day and wow!  The difference is night and day!  I am actually able to function normally and am so relieved.  I'm still scared to be taking it because of the addiction that can come with it,  but with my Dr's guidance I am feeling better about this medication.  My anxiety has subsided! Grateful!",10,53
Xanax,"I started this medication after developing a moderate/serve anxiety disorder after my grandfather passed unexpectedly, I was started on .25mg to to take twice a day and it had absolutely NO effect on me. If anything it made me anxiety symptoms worse and my breathing more shallow &amp; panicked. The only thing the medication was good for was to help me sleep. Other than that it did not clear any anxious thoughts or take any of the edge off my anxiety. I would not recommend it for constant anxiety/anxious thoughts. I've heard it's only good for killing quick burst panic attacks. Has no affect on long term anxious thoughts.",2,21
Xanax,"Xanax may have saved my life. In the early nineties I was a young man pursuing my ambitions career, cars and women. Whatever I have done / experienced led me to be violent in my reaction to assholes. Also mom raised me as she went through menopause and was volatile. I was dangerously aggressive in my early 30's. xnx worked with no side affects noticed, sleepiness at first, that's all.I sought xnx because it made me feel like I should, calm, thus able to focus. Did well all these years. I got laid off, Doc retired and I can't find a local doc to prescribe.  The system took it away, Clandestine alternatives are expensive, risking life, limb and employment,  Docs are ignorant sometimes.",8,31
Xanax,"In 2007 I started having what I now know panic attacks, but didn't know it at the time my doctor sent my blood in for testing, trying to figure out why I'm having to pull over when driving cuz I think I'm going to pass out due to hyperventilation. First I thought I was having low blood sugar but a few weeks later at my follow up appt. My doctor said  you're having major panic attacks I believe... I tried every anxiety medication there is trying to feel better.Then my Dr. Gave me 1mg alpazolam every 6 hours as needed. I still take xanex and 20mg of lexapro to this day.  Just having a xanex bar in my pocket helps prevent attacks, today I get 45 2mg bars  and I make sure I try to take no xanex a few times a week so I don't become dependent",10,28
Xanax,"Recently was prescribed Klonopin because my doctor didn't like how Xanax had such a quick onset but also quick fall.  I was okay with the change initially because even at 0.5mg, Xanax would make me so sleepy I couldn't function.  That made it pretty impossible to take during any day panic.  I've been have anxiety the last couple days, so I took a Klonopin last night hoping that I would wake with a sense of calm like I usually did with the Xanax.  Nope...the anxiety is actually worse.  Xanax isn't perfect; like I said, I generally try not to take it unless I am at home, so I've suffered a lot when I shouldn't have had to, but it has a much more calming affect than Klonopin is giving me.  I never took it long-term - only as needed.",8,25
Xanax,"I only take as needed, and it usually works awesome. Even knowing i have it as backup reduces my anxiety. It works best if taken before a stressful event but having a TBI makes remembering difficult. It also works better for me since i don't have to take daily on a schedule like other anxiety medications",9,28
Xanax,"Really does help with anxiety/panic attacks, but has nasty withdrawals. I was prescribed .5mg 3x a day, and whenever I moved, my new doctor stopped prescribing me them, pretty much forcing me to quit cold turkey. Worst month of my life, and it only exacerbated my anxiety in the end.",5,25
Xanax,Xanax helped me major status! When I was 22 years old tried spice its a messed up chemical synthetic THC bull.. anyways I smoked three bowls and then boom I couldn't breath my hands and muscles tightened up and I couldn't move. And my chest felt like I had 500 pounds on it! I thought I was dying and my whole body was tingly! Went to the hospital and they diagnose with GAD and panic disorder. For three months I did not leave my house and I thought I was dying 50% of the time. So my doctor put me on Ativan for a month I stopped taking it in 5 days. I felt like I was going insane. So I was given. Xanax for a month. The first time taking it BOOM it all stopped I was a normal person it helped me get over all my panic attacks! 0.5Mg as needed!,10,43
Xanax,"This is a qualified positive review for Xanax.  I was suffering from mild depression and anxiety last winter and my doctor put me on Wellbutrin.   That stuff takes 4-8 weeks to work and in the interim it can really up your anxiety level.  A week later I started 1mg Xanax 1-2X/day and it took care of the anxiety immediately.  I continued using Xanax for more restful sleep but after about 3 months I realized that short and long term memory was WAY down.   Stopped Xanax and replaced with GABA and this seems to be a far better solution.   The Wellbutrin worked great, felt more energy the first week but did take 6-8 weeks to fully kick in.  I will now ONLY take the Xanax for rare, severe stress.  Also check the  connection to Alzheimers.",7,35
Xanax,"Xanax made me a normal person again. I had bouts of anxiety seemingly my entire life, but it didn't become debilitating until I reached my 20s and became overwhelmed with everything on my plate and I lost sight of who I was. I couldn't focus on anything because I was too worried about school and work and my health issues. It became too much, and I dropped out of school with a 4.0! Anxiety stole my life away, but Xanax gave me the strength to gain it back. I'm finally about to graduate, have a wonderful job, and just recently got engaged! I am a normal person, and I thank anxiety for calming my brain and enabling me to live a beautiful, productive life. I highly recommend it if you genuinely suffer from debilitating anxiety.",10,92
Xanax,"I take this as needed for anxious situations: i.e. the dentist (I would flee from the office crying if not for the Xanax), being around large crowds of people, etc.   It certainly takes off the edge that accompanies anxiety and helps me to be in situations that I normally couldn't.  It seems to take 45 mins to an hour to kick in so I am proactive in taking it to be prepared.  It's been a great help to get me to certain places and be able live life.",9,31
Xanax,"I have had anxiety since I was a child, from my personal experiences this medicine is the fastest and effective but BE VERY CAREFUL also the most depending.  I ran my prescription short one month and was without for a couple of days and had a seizure while driving. Just because the doctor says three or four times a day doesn't mean you need them that much, BE VERY CAREFUL!",9,72
Xanax,I started having anxiety attacks a few months ago due to marijuana use. Bad life choice I regret but due to my natural anxiety marijuana made it 10x worse. I started having anxiety attacks sometimes up to 6x a day for a few weeks. I had a visit to my doctor scheduled anyway and was honest and told him about my situation. He prescribed me xanax to use as a short term medication for my anxiety attacks as he said weed can cause horrible anxiety for a month in some ppl. I took it as prescribed which was every six hours as needed. I started with about .25mg a day but took .5 a few times when it was real bad. 2 weeks later I began splitting the pills in half to .12. Am completely off it now but made a huge difference in my life for that time.,8,27
Xanax,"I've been battling anxiety since before I could remember it got so bad that I finally tried Xanax  for thw first time today and so far I feel like my best self l. My mind is no longer racing a million miles a minute and I don't feel tense at all, only peacefulness.",10,82
Xanax,Severe withdrawal,7,54
Xanax,"Rash, dry eye, dry mouth, dry skin, sore tongue and throat, cramps.",5,25
Xanax,This medication has helped me a lot it keeps me calm and it's fast acting just take them as prescribed!,10,92
Xanax,Great for what it is meant for but a huge risk factor for dependency. If you can your better off taking Lexapro.,9,40
Xanax,Takes away all anxiety and stress. I have GAD SAD and PTSD.,10,74
Xanax,"Works very well for anxiety. The best way to take these types of medicines is to take them as needed. Some doctors will tell you to take them everyday as prescribed, but I found in my 20 years of experience with Xanax that taking them everyday is an easy way for it to become habit forming and addictive. When I take them as needed I don't become dependent on them. I think doctors disagree with this method because they feel that you need to counter the anxiety before you get it and that way you can learn to tolerate it. I have tried using Xanax both ways, it's nice not having anxiety, but your body and mind will adapt to the dosage and if you take it long enough you will find you need a higher dose to feel like you did.",10,95
Xanax,"I noticed my memory was very much affected on Xanax.  This is the quickest working benzo in my opinion, but does not last long.  Also, the withdrawals from Xanax were more severe than the withdrawals from the other benzos I've been on.  It works great for some people, but not so much for me.",5,44
Xanax,"Acts very quickly and definitely feel the calming effect. The only downsides is that it doesn't last very long (2-3 hrs max, maybe even less) and you quickly build up a tolerance for it so you end up having to take much more the more you use it.",8,44
Xanax,Only benzodiazepine that worked completely. Been on all the others. Have tried antidepressants with negative results. So at the correct dose. Alprazolam is what I consider the hardest working anxiety and stress reliever available.,9,96
Xanax,"Great for anxiety. However, only recommend using short term. I've gone through opiate withdrawing as well as benzo withdraws, and benzo withdraws are far worse. Never felt more suicidal...use with caution...",2,70
Xanax,I have been on Xanax for a few years due to my anxiety discover. This tablet which I only take a quarter of when it is necessary which doesn't happen very often has helped me sleep and calm down.  My sister has terminal cancer.  It also helped me go through tough events.,10,51
Xanax,"I take this medication as needed. I take 150 mg Effexor daily, which helps with the majority of my depression and anxiety, but I take Xanax when I need to take the edge off. I was recently prescribed this, and I have only had to use it twice, while flying (I go into full panic mode). I took an entire pill 30 minutes before my flight and it made me relax right away. I have never been able to sleep on a plane (even during international flights), but it calmed me down to the point I fell asleep during both flights. It didn't even bother me during take off when the pilot had to slam on the breaks due to a cargo light. This medication does make me sleepy, though I have not taken half a dose so far. My panic attacks are not as frequent as some.",10,24
Xanax,Been taking it for 2 years and it gets me through anxiety attacks.,10,90
Xanax,"I have been on quite a few antidepressants in addition to Xanax.  The antidepressants made my anxiety and panic worse, needing to increase my intake of Xanax when on the antidepressant(s).  I was really reluctant to take the Xanax when I was first prescribed the medication.  I have been of Pristiq for 8 months now and have lowered my Xanax from 1 mg in the morning, 1mg midday and 2 mg at bed.  I am now taking 0.5mg in the morning and 1.5 mg at bed.  I am taking vitamins, doing yoga and taking better care of myself. My doctor knows, I am honest. He wanted me to take 2mg every 8 hours but never did. My Mother just died a few weeks ago and have been getting really bad anxiety and still the same dose helps me.  Hope this helps.",10,124
Xanax,The best to ease the stress,10,70
Xanax,"After a recent medical diagnosis, I had a difficult time coping and felt a tremendous sense of fear and worry constantly. Brought me to the point I was physically ill everyday and having panic attacks frequently. Xanax is wonderful when you find the right dose. Too much and I became a zombie. 0.25 MG was my perfect dose. It brought me down from panic and allowed me to take a step back and deal with my problems rationally.",10,142
Xanax,"It makes any impossible situation more possible, it controls violence rage temper anger towards others. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, panic attacks and keeps you calm.  The best!",10,136
Xanax,"I was in England when I started getting feeling of depersonalization, forehead pressure, fear, negative thoughts and irritation etc. I came back to my country and consulted a doctor. He diagnosed me with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. What he prescribed me may have worked but honestly speaking I did not give fair chance to the prescribed medicine.  He did not prescribe me Xanax but I managed to get it from somewhere myself as I had read about its effectiveness against anxiety. It worked perfectly for me. I killed my anxiety with it. It normalizes me and keeps me going ahead in life. I give 9/10.",9,90
Xanax,"I thought this medicine might help with the onset of an atrial fibrillation attack and it does!  Not a guarantee but very often helps  especially at night when I feel something coming on...it allows me to fall into a deeper sleep which at times kicks the onset.  Also very useful for anxiousness, as documented.  I do not take it daily, only when needed.",9,69
Xanax,"I get intense panic attacks. Xanax is very effective at working quickly to stop a panic attack. It saved my life, until after a few months I tried to stop taking it and got horrible withdrawals. I felt like I was dying, my anxiety was worse than it had ever been in my life, high blood pressure (and mine is naturally low), tachycardia, hallucinations, tremors. I hope anyone considering taking Xanax takes it at a low dose and not daily. If daily, do not quit cold turkey.",9,85
Xanax,First time taking Xanax today and I feel great! The doctor prescribed me 0.5mg every 6 hours but I took a 0.25 and it helped tremendously! I am calm and able to function. All those anxious and negative thoughts just slip away.,10,115
Xanax,This medication has helped me live a normal life well more normal. I don't worry much about nothing and I can go into Walmart and feel comfortable. My social life is improving as well. There were times I couldn't get myself to interact with people sometimes I wouldn't even answer the phone. I've only been on this medicine for a little over a month it has truly been a lifesaver. I am sleeping like a baby I can't remember the last time I've struggled to calm down and go to sleep only to wake up several times a night using the bathroom or just couldn't relax. My quality of life is getting much better.,9,172
Xanax,I have experienced anxiety since being diagnosed with Cancer 4 years ago. I use 0.5 MG's twice daily and stick to this dosage given to me by my doctor. It helps me tremendously. I have tried to step off it several times and found it very difficult. Will remain on it for as long as I need it. It improves my life quality and keeps panic and anxiety at bay.,10,101
Xanax,"Yeah, it works. Some people are more sensitive than others. Generally, you take a pill (depends on dosage) and you just start feeling your tight chest and stomach release, and I notice I begin breathing more calmly and normally. Just feels good all over, which is such a contrast from the horrors of anxiety. It can make you a little sleepy. I think for 'normal people' it would make them very sleepy. For 'anxious' people, I think it makes you normal and relaxed. The one problem is that if you take it too much, like three days in a row, the effect is reduced and you have to 'up' the dosage. I think it works best for occasional use, like before a difficult situation or when you're just having a lot of anxiety and need calm.",10,143
Xanax,Extremely helpful!,10,45
Xanax,"This works effectively for anxiety as well as sleeping problems. It doesn't impair my cognitive abilities. It is not addictive to me, however the only problem is getting off Xanax and the backlash effect it creates. I have successfully used Tranxene to bridge this gap and taper off safely. I rate it a 9 1/2; it has been a true miracle when I needed it most!",9,56
Xanax,"I was very uneasy always sad, lost how to be happy, jumpy at the slightest things and panic and from the second or third pill began to feel a difference. I felt like I could have fun again or really smile at least. It is like my brain needed a little help adjusting to difficult situations.",10,80
Xanax,"I should start by letting you know that I was an addict of medicines (and having been through treatment, now enjoy 2 years and 9 months of sobriety) but I am also a sufferer of a wretched case of anxiety complete with full blown crippling panic attacks.  Which I have suffered from for many years, but upon completing treatment for my recreational use and now being honest with doctors it was very difficult for that reason to get one to prescribe something that would help my condition.  When I found one that would I would have to have my wife allocate the Xanax out to me but I will say it has helped and worked wonders.  IN MODERATION!!",8,85
Xanax,"Works almost immediately. Gets rid of chest tightness, anger, emotional rollercoaster. Just doesn't last a full 8 hours.",9,65
Xanax,"I have to start by saying that I'm fearful of medications for starters, secondly I have dealt with anxiety, panic attacks and agoraphobia for many years now! I'm not housebound but do have a small neighborhood radius of comfort. I have in the past felt shamed of my condition as I thought I was unique and alone and somewhat embarrassed to try to explain my irrational feelings and thoughts, which I have learned since that they are entirely made up and thoughts lead to feelings that lead to behaviors all of which can be undone with the help of medicine, therapy, relaxation techniques, journaling, diet, exercise and not being afraid to open up about your anxiety. You are NOT alone! Learn to RELAX it WORKS.",10,137
Xanax,"I've been on a variety of different benzodiazipines for about 16 years now for anxiety, Agorphobia and even insomnia and I have to say Xanax is by far the most effective. I've been on Valium, Klonopin, Ativan and even SSRI'S and none helped me the way Xanax did. Ativan did absolutely nothing, Valium was decent(I'd give it a 5) because of its long acting qualities and Klonopin made me tired all the time. Only with Xanax can I lead a normal, productive life. Without that medicine I would not be able to hang out with friends, go to the grocery store, go to the mailbox, associate with my family ...these are all triggers of my anxiety. Even answering the phone! I've taken 2mgs two times daily now for the past 7 years and it works great!",10,136
Xanax,"I have always struggled with worry, stress, and anxiety and recently have gone through some really difficult situation. My doctor diagnosed me with panic attacks and prescribed me a low dose of Xanax to take when needed. I take half a pill because I am afraid of developing a habit and hate relying on medications. This really does work and helps me a lot. I have only needed it a few times.",10,89
Xanax,"I have anxiety for a long time, taking Zoloft for it since 99 not sure how much it helps, but when I get really bad I take Xanax .25mg, it does help quickly. My only thing on Xanax, I wished that it wouldn't be habit forming and because of that, you may need to make dosage higher and higher after .25mg. Also recommend checking for interactions with Xanax if you are taking any other medicines.",9,47
Xanax,I asked my doctor if he could give me something as I had been under stress and anxiety for some time.  I take 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day.  I take it about 1/2 hour before I go to bed so I can relax and sleep. Not sure if the Xanax is causing some weight gain or not.,9,34
Xanax,"As far back as I can remember, kindergarten I think. I've suffered from major anxiety issues. I can remember throwing up in the trash can by the entrance to Jr. High School, and through High School even. I could then, and can now make my hands sweat just by thinking about it. When I finally got on Xanax, I was far more outgoing, funny, and learned there was a whole side to me I didn't really know existed due to Anxiety. My point is.......don't wait! Talk to some one who can help you with Anxiety if you have it. And BE HONEST! Tell them how hard it is for you!!",10,167
Xanax,"I started taking Xanax in 2007- my daily dose was up to 4mg daily as needed. I finally felt that I had my life back. In 2013 we moved to AZ and the 1st Dr I saw here discontinued it, cold turkey. A few others were drastically cut back and stopped without any warning. I must say it has been difficult.",10,40
Xanax,Xanax is the best when taken only as needed and not on a daily basis.  Nothing else comes close.  Just be cautious and it can be used over  a longer period of time if not abused. It has worked for me that way.,0,114
Xanax,"Xanax was a Godsend in the short term. Nearly immediate peace from all anxiety and panic symptoms. The longer I took it though, the more problematic it became. Constantly increasing dose for effectiveness, switching formulations. Finally addiction, dependence - didn't matter if it was called this or that. Discontinuing Xanax was painful. Like weeks long, restless, climbing the walls, no sleep. I'd still call it useful in a low dose, well supervised situation.",9,66
Xanax,"I take Xanax very rarely with Lexapro as my primary anxiety med. Xanax works perfectly to knock out secondary panic and anxiety symptoms, the best as needed anxiety med on the market. I don't recommend it as your primary anxiety med though, too addictive.",9,52
Xanax,"Out of all the benzodiazepines I think that Xanax (alprazolam) is the best for me, acts quick &amp; does what it says, just be careful &amp; if you are going to ask your Dr. For them I recommend maybe starting out a smaller dose and work up from there. If that doesn't work, the reason is, after a bit you get a little immune to strength &amp; can bump up in dosage if this happens, unless you have a high tolerance, then maybe start at 1 mg, that way you can still move up if that doesn't work, but I recommend starting small &amp; moving up in dosage if needed.",10,59
Xanax,I started out on Valium 5 mg 4 times a day when I was 22 due to petit-mal seizures. The doctors said my anxiety was causing my blood pressure to go out the roof. At age 29 had a heart attack due to anxiety making my BP so high I was in V fib. Now at age 38 I'm taking Xanax 2 mg 3 times a day. For me all the antidepressants cause some kind of stimulation hat makes my anxiety worsen so I stopped the SSRI's. It is working for now but I fear what happens when this doesn't work anymore what am I going to do. So tired of having anxiety and panic disorder. I don't think too many doctors understand what a profound problem this causes in ones life. So really express how you really feel to your Doc.,10,93
Xanax,"I have severe anxiety including social anxiety that confines me to my apartment 95% of the time. I also suffer from trichotillomania where my anxiety is so bad I pull my hair out. Have had this for 20 years and all the shrinks could not help me. I am 32 years old and just recently have been put on Xanax 0.5mg 3 times daily as needed. Well the first week I slept and slept, which is good because I wasn't sleeping before. I also have bipolar disorder and severe depression. Pristiq helps a little but I am allergic to everything else. Xanax slows down my racing thoughts so I can think clearer and make decisions easier and is helping with the hair pulling but am still desperately searching for help with that and have not found it.",8,56
Xanax,"I have had a very emotional ups and downs in life and after getting married 15 years ago my life became more hectic. 10 years ago when I lost my cousin; I had panic attacks and I became hypochondriac. I took Anxit(Xanax) 0.25 to 0.5 mg twice a day. I stopped all of a sudden after an year and did not notice withdrawal symptoms as depression was somewhat like part of life dealing with people. Now recently, I started having very bad panic attacks and I almost stopped going out alone as I was scared to go out alone and my panic was of heart attacks and death by sudden reasons etc; for the past week I again started taking Anxit 0.25mg once in morning and night. I am fine and happy for the past week and I want to continue same dose.",10,45
Xanax,"Best medicine I ever been put on. Started off with two 0.05mg a day then to five 0.5 a day, and I'm Down to Three 1.0 MG a day and it's starting to not work as good. So I need to talk to my doctor and up the dose to at least 4 or 5 MG for my really bad anxiety and depression!",10,29
Xanax,"If taken as directed, this though short lasting medication, is a very effective treatment for the prevention and release from panic and anxiety attacks.",10,50
Xanax,"I have a very stressful life. After my mother passing in 2005, I started having major anxiety. It truly was debilitating my entire life. My Dr put me on 0.05 mg twice a day to help. It was the BEST thing I ever did. I have been on them for 8 yrs now's. I'm 32 and a mother of 4. There are days when I really feel the anxiety peek and I take one. Its the only thing that will work within 15-20 mins. It really has helped me tremendously. I can take my meds as prescribed and still am able to take care of home, kids and work feeling normal. I would suggest this for anyone how has anxiety or panic attacks or tons of stress.",10,101
Xanax,"I'VE taken Xanax prescribed by my Dr for almost 2 yrs and I think its great for nerves, anxiety and good sleep. I take it at night and sleep sound all night and in the morning get up refreshed. I'm an insomniac so the help sleeping is amazing. I give it a 10, just stick with the dose the Dr. prescribes.",10,91
Xanax,If I don't take it my skin feels like something is biting me and I itch all over I get very agitated and I can't sleep or sit still or focus my attention for a normal amount of time,10,36
Xanax,"I've been suffering from anxiety and panic attacks for quite some time now and in the past year it's been happening more. Xanax helps, I've been prescribed this because it does help when the anxiety levels get very high and panic attacks and it also helps me to get some sleep at night as it helps reduce the level of anxiety.  Every person is different.",10,66
Xanax,Very good.,0,34
Xanax,"Saved my Job..I'm a truck driver so I spend a lot of time in a truck and it gets really depressing being away from the family for weeks at a time but Xanax helps me cope with the situation and this is the only medicine I've found that wont make me tired and drowsy, unlike Zoloft that made me so tired I had to take two days off work. Xanax helps me relax and gives me focus so I can deal with my work situation.",9,73
Xanax,"I have always suffered from anxiety attacks, but at the age of 22, I seem to have them more severely. I have had a rough past, that I try and keep to myself. This last month my panic attacks were so severe that I thought I was going crazy or dying. I lost all sleep, and I felt so ashamed in front of my kids. My mind was racing and all I could think was these terrible thoughts.  I was prescribed 0.5 mg of Xanax and I cut the pills in half throughout the day. I have never had such a quick relief from panic attacks. I almost instantly feel normal when I take them. And it lasts for quite a while until I take the other half of the medication. No side effects I have had with these, which is great because I have a fear of taking medications.",0,105
Xanax,I feel like I'm not a mean and hated person wile being on Xanax. I have been suffering really bad lately with panic attacks and I can't breath and my cheat falls like to explode. My doc put me on 0.5mg to take 1 a day but sometimes I have to take more than 1 a day but it works wonders. I can be a better mom and wife with it.,10,57
Xanax,"I'm prescribed 1mg of Xanax as needed. If I ever feel very anxious and take Xanax, my anxiety level tunes down to a 1. I'm almost too relaxed. However, Xanax can be very habit forming, so only take your dose.",10,41
Xanax,Xanax is amazing! In 2010 I was overwhelmed with emotions. My mother had a stroke in March of that year and at the same time me and my wife were expecting our 1st child. All these emotions led to me having depression and anxiety I was finally diagnosed in 2012 with anxiety disorder/panic attacks. They prescribed me Xanax 0.5mg one a day and it works miracles in my daily life.,10,48
Xanax,I've been on Xanax for 20 years for anxiety. I have tried just about everything they have come out with and this is all that works.,10,129

Xanax,"I had severe anxiety, agoraphobia. I am on Xanax for about 3-4 month started with 0.25mg morning and 0.25mg at night and now on 0.50mg two times a day and feel great. No panic and my life is much easy. The world is more familiar and I can go anywhere. It's like I have wings now. I will try to leave the medication in future but for now I accept my situation because I like the feeling of living. As an anxious I was afraid of death same as I was afraid of life. Now, I LIVE.",10,130
Xanax,"I am a teenager who has anxiety/panic attacks occasionally, and my physcisian has been giving me 0.5mg of Xanax for the past couple months to take as needed for anxiety. I can't tell you how wonderful this medication has been. After 15-20 min of taking it my anxiety/panic feelings diminish completely, and I have no need to feel anxious about anything after that.",10,90
Xanax,"Xanax has saved my life. I've been on them for almost four years. I am depressed, have panic attacks, and severe anxiety. Xanax has made me feel normal. I can now be in public unlike before it would make me nervous. I can deal with working and school without having severe anxiety. Racing thoughts and worrying constantly are no more, Xanax rakes that away. I'm not as panicky,  just relaxed and can handle issues, stress, everyday life better. I highly recommended Xanax if you have anxiety or panic attacks.  I'm on 2mg twice a day.  I take one as soon as I wake up, one in the evening, then my sleeping medication are night. I love Xanax for helping me.",10,120
Xanax,"After my divorce I was depressed and having anxiety attacks, I went to a respectable Doctor but she prescribed me Wellbutrin, after taking it for awhile I felt numb (mentally). I tried a 1mg Xanax and it was perfect! I slept great, but when I first started taking them I would wake up groggy. I would get a shower and that would wake me up. I've been taking them for about 7 years. I am currently cutting my doses down to try to ween off them! I do not have an addictive personality but after a job loss of 10 yrs I tried to quit cold turkey! Not a good idea at all! I can only say use as prescribed and less if possible! Don't just pop one because you are stressed out! Take a walk, talk to a friend, please use with caution.",7,105
Xanax,"I am about to turn 50 and my life of anxiety has been a recent and unpleasant downward spiral. I ended up in the emergency room twice with soaring blood pressure, flushing and heart palpitations plus overwhelming feelings of panic. I live daily with either anxiety or small panic attacks, they are debilitating and have affected my ability to continue work on my degree. After my last ER visit a doc felt I was having panic attacks and directed me to seek help at a Mental Health Clinic. I've tried several anti-depressants and I have not tolerated them well. Xanax (0.5 mg) has gotten me through many a day and night and I prefer this medication over all the others. It decreases the anxiety very quickly and helps to maintain a sense of normality.",10,151
Xanax,Relaxed and calm,10,62
Xanax,Xanax has been a life saver! Just recently had a heart attack and had my 4th stent put in. Was still having chest pains which obviously scare me when I have them. The tricky part is separating the chest pains from anxiety which I have been diagnosed with. What a vicious cycle!,10,60
Xanax,I was 19 years old when my family doctor prescribed me Xanax 0.25mg. for my stress and anxiety from work and life at the time. I'm 43 now I only take it when I'm under a lot of stress or when my anxiety level goes up in any situation in my life. At the same time when I'm stressed out I go walking and running because it helps too. I wouldn't know what I would do if I didn't have Xanax to help me.,10,109
Xanax,If you want absolutely zero anxiety then Xanax/alprazolam are very helpful.,10,88
Xanax,4 years ago I had my first panic attack/anxiety. Had hyperventilation and end up in the ER. My doctor prescribed 0.025mg of Xanax. I took the medicine as required. I wasn't able to drive and do anything out by myself. I was afraid and worried of being alone. I always fear that it would happen again. My thoughts are always what if...Anxiety was taking over my life. I was able to control it for 2 years. Just this month I recently panicked for no reason. My dr. put me on this just in case I have a full blown anxiety...but the downside to this medicine is it makes me really sleepy and tired. But it does works!,9,69
Xanax,"I have taken Xanax on and off for 18 years and I would say it has been a lifesaver for me. I have episodes of anxiety, nothing earth shattering, but debilitating non-the-less. Xanax has helped smooth those times over and make life manageable. This is a wonderful medicine!",10,113
Xanax,"I'm 23 about to be 24 , and I've taken Xanax for going on 9 years.  For my panic attacks/anxiety mainly.  I absolutely love this medicine.   I find myself extra friendly sometimes, but better than being a grouch or hiding from my own shadow. I take anywhere from 1mg to 1 1/2mg per day.",10,70
Xanax,I suffer from anxiety/ panic attacks as well as live a somewhat stressful life style. Xanax has been my life saver and has been a tremendous aide in allowing me to continue  to function in life on a daily basis. Truly a blessing in my life 100%.,10,77
Xanax,Xanax helps me cope with life. I live a pore life it gives me the nerve to do things I wouldn't do.,10,43
Xanax,"I thank Xanax for making me a better mom. I was mean to everyone around me and I took the motto this is who I am to heart. It was not until my mother died after having my third child that I actually realized my angry childhood and anger in this world was not to blame on any one but my own feelings. After taking Xanax and some therapy, I am a new person. I would not be able to live without it. I do not abuse it. I only take the amount prescribed by my doctor and no more. I also take Paxil which helped me a lot as well, but without the Xanax, I would not be living. Participating with my life and most of all my children. I read to them now we go on picnics and wilderness hikes. I love my life, now!",10,102
Xanax,Good.,10,23
Xanax,"A God send for my untreatable insomnia. Only side effect that prevents me from taking it more often is the testosterone suppressing effect. I spend a lot of time working out and eating right and noticed my strength and body composition, took a very noticeable nose dive a few months after starting on it. I have used 1-2 mg nightly for almost a year. On the plus side, it has helped me get the deep restorative sleep I struggle to get.",8,5
Xanax,This medicine has saved my life in my own opinion. I suffered from severe panic attacks and thought that I was going crazy prior to being diagnosed with my conditions. Now I feel like I can lead a normal life. I am able to work a full time job that is extremely stressful at times and not worry about going into a panic attack. I no longer have trouble losing my breath when I do get upset and this medicine has made a tremedious difference in my every day life.,10,69
Xanax,"Unbelieveable. I thought I was living a normal life, until my doctor prescribed it for me the first time. It has been a miracle for me.",10,52
Xanax,"Wonderful to control anxiety, as well as panic disorder.",8,41
Xanax,Happy and free of anxiety.,10,43
Xanax,"I've been tormented by anxiety since childhood. I am 24 years old and have been through a lot in my life. I've been diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety, panic attacks, ADD. I've been medicated most my life as well. My anxiety got so bad in high school that I had to be home schooled. I wake up in the morning feeling like my heart will explode for no apparent reason. I get intense irrational fear and intense impulses to harm myself because I just can't take it and get frustrated I start throwing and breaking things I can't stand to be alone a lot of the time. Xanax works fast and calms me down without knocking me out. Depending on the severity of my attacks I take up to 2 mg. No less than 0.5-1mg.",10,46
Xanax,Xanax has been a great thing for me. I was very scared to take it in the beginning because I had no idea how I was going to feel but it really calmed me down after two weeks of thinking I was going crazy or dying. I had never experienced anything like this before but I had to get a blood transfusion for my anemia and all hell broke through. My doctor gave me 0.025 and I only take 1/4 of that I Break it in 4's I don't want to go to sleep just take the edge off so my advice to anyone that has to take this even if you have a higher dose just take 1/4 of it until you see how it will respond to your body I hope I could be a help to someone.,8,51
Xanax,This is an ABSOULUTE LIFE SAVER if you have bad anxiety or having a panic attack. Would be lost without it,10,48

Xanax,"Brilliant, the only thing that helps my anxiety and panic attacks.",9,36

Xanax,"I am a 33 year old mother of 4 and suffered from depression and very bad anxiety for 5 years. Been in hospital 11 times, the longest 6 months. They filled me with all sorts of medicines at some points. I was so out of it but then a new doctor I met gave me Xanax along with some other antidepressants and I am doing fine and living a normal life. I think these are great.",9,32
Xanax,"I have had tremendous benefits from just 0.25mg taken as needed.  I previously had lived with anxiety and panic (from social situations, particularly work meetings, eating out at restaurants, etc) for about 9 months before working up the courage to see my doctor.  I started developing avoidance tendencies, and decided that I was tired of letting anxiety run my life.  I am careful to take it only as needed, and would highly recommend for those with occasional severe anxiety or panic.  I've been exercising more and focusing hard on positive thinking, and that combination with the occasional Xanax has been tremendous. Remember, you have an awesome life to live!",9,77
Xanax,"I used to work for a bank and I was being helped by one of my colleagues on opening an account for a customer. I was making many mistakes, I began to panic and I was sweating profusely. The customers wouldn't make much conversation with me because they felt they we're making me nervous. I had to excuse myself to take a breather in the break room! Xanax has helped me become more relaxed and socially open with strangers. I feel like my job interviews are going to be pleasant now! The only side effect I experience is tiredness after the medicine wears out, but that only lasted for about 1 hour for me.",9,22
Xanax,"When the world is closing in on me I take a Xanax and suddenly I'm able to function again. I can learn and adapt and I feel like I can capture and retain information better. Without it any new information is lost on me and my learning process is inhibited. The little stuff is not a problem anymore and I can focus on accomplishing anything I need to. I didn't start having anxiety attacks until after college. I did really well and all of a sudden I felt like in the real world I could not meet the expectations because of how well I did in school. Everything became too much. Debt, learning a new job, reading (which is my favorite thing to do), being with family and friends. I hit a wall. Even with anti-depressants I could not function.",10,21
Xanax,Xanax is great. It gets rid of anxiety but makes me drowsy.,8,13
Xanax,"It helps me from having severe anxiety attacks, I do go through normal emotions, so I only take them when I get too overwhelmed and I am going to have an anxiety attack. They are very helpful.",7,18
Xanax,"Very good. A little drowsiness after panic subsides, though I'm not sure if this is due to a physiological response to subsiding high levels of hormones associated with fight/flight response (e.g., cortisol and adrenaline) involved in panic attacks.",10,14
Xanax,Helps me a lot.,10,10
Xanax,"I've taken Xanax for years for occassional insomia. For the past year, I've been battling with high blood pressure along with some new health issues that popped up. For the last two weeks, my heart has been racing and my stomach has had butterflies.  I really felt like hiding under the covers and didn't know why. I kept wondering why am I SO afraid lying in bed watching TV?  I felt as though my heart was about to just rip itself out of my chest.  So I decided to take a Xanax during the day and it was like a miracle cure.  Hopefully, the panic attacks wont last forever, but thank God, I had something to help.",9,29
Xanax,Just great. I do not use the prescribed amount (0.5mg every 8 hours or every 4 hours as needed). I have not used for a week now but just took 1/2 pill and 25 minutes later I feel good.,10,15
Xanax,I do not use nearly the dosage prescribed to me (0.5mg every 8 hours or every 4 hours as needed). I have used 8 pills in the last 21 days and none since a week ago. I was feeling a little anxious just now and took a half pill and 25 minutes later I feel relaxed and find it easier to breath.,0,16
Xanax,"Xanax has literally saved my life. I also suffer of mitral valve prolapse and I had mvp symptoms when stressed or when my panic attacks and anxiety would kick in. Xanax took care of all my symptoms, it even kept my spiking blood pressure in check. What a miracle medication, thank you from my heart to whoever found it.",0,20
Xanax,"I am so thankful for this medication! It has saved me countless trips to the ER due to severe, gripping panic attacks. It took about 8 years of anxiety, useless trying of several SSRI's, and DOZENS of trips to the hospital hyperventilating, shaking, screaming with my pulse approaching 200 before a smart doctor finally prescribed Me Xanax.  I take the medication on an as-needed basis, and sparingly. I take 0.25mg (half pill) to prevent anxiety attacks when anticipating an panic-inducing situation. I take 0.50mg at the first signs an attack is starting. The quickest, most effective route is to lightly crush the pill with your teeth and let it dissolve beneath your tongue.  My experience with Xanax is pretty much identical to that of Ativan.",9,19
Xanax,"Since developing Pneumonia back in September I have been experiencing very bad panic attacks (never had them before the pneumonia). I didnt know what panic attacks even were so I spent countless days in the hospital really feeling like I was dying. I believe the panic attacks is masking another condition that the doctors have yet to find, which also means the Xanax is just masking something not treating it at all. But I have to live with taking them because nothing else helps.",0,8
Xanax,"It kicks in fast when you get that real bad feeling but I'm tired of taking pills everyday and it happenes everyday a few times a day, bad body aches breathing chest pains. I don't even worry about anything and boom it creeps up on me fast.",9,12
Xanax,"Xanax has been a life saver. I have always had problems feeling a little anxious.  But once I was diagnosed as having a brain tumor at 26, it only made things worse.  My doctor prescribed Lexapro, which worked okay, but I didn't like the way it made me feel, so I stopped taking them on my own.  One particular night about 3 weeks ago, I got so upset that I thought I was having a heart attack.  I was dizzy, chest hurting and pounding, weakness. Nobody could find anything medically wrong with me.  I asked the doctor for something for anxiety to which he prescribed Xanax 0.25mg every 6 hours and within the 30 minutes of taking it, all my symptoms had diminished.  Xanax really saved my life.",10,19
Xanax,"I suffer from panic attacks that occur after I go to sleep.  I wake up about an hour or so after I fall asleep (I don't have trouble falling asleep) freaking out.  My heart is racing, I am terrified and I feel like I will go crazy before it stops.  They are so scary because no matter how many times I have suffered through them, I am always sure I am dying when I have one.  Previously I was given other medications like Buspar or Paxil, but I didn't tolerate them very well and they did not stop the attacks - only slowed them down.  Once I was prescribed Xanax I noticed that the medication would actually stop a panic attack in its tracks, which was a miracle.  The medication has almost completely stopped the attacks - but not 100 %.",9,16
Xanax,"Xanax is a miracle. Just recently prescribed Xanax and Lexapro at age 33 for generalized anxiety disorder and I can honestly say that I am back to my old self. I have only had 2 panic attacks in the last 6 months. I can sleep all night without waking up, I am much more laid back, I am calm and not worrying all the time. I would definitely talk to your MD about both of these medicines if you truly have an Anxiety disorder.  Both have been a life saver for me and my family.",10,22
Xanax,"I have taken Xanax for 24 years and it has been a life-saver for me!  When my psychiatrist prescribed it for me, 24 years ago, I was just about at the end of my rope.  I was crying all the time, was hyperventilating, had bouts of my heart fluttering and many other typical anxiety-related symptoms. I was at the point that I was afraid I was dying or going crazy. Over the years, my dosage has been adjusted to work with my life at the time, but I have always taken it exactly as prescribed and have never wanted or needed more than was prescribed.  As a matter of fact, I am currently taking 0.5 mg two times per day, but can take as much as 1 mg five times per day.",10,31
Xanax,Works great for short notices. If you find yourself in a anxiety situation or short notice to do some public speaking then Xanax is great for those situations.  When I take them I only take half the pill and that dose is fine for me. It kicks in about 20-30 minutes and lasts a good couple of hours at the most. Its similar to Klonopin but works faster. I recommend it for as needed use only. If its an all day thing then Klonopin is better. Just my experience with it. Others may vary.,9,10
Xanax,"This works great for me too, with little to no side effects. But the doctors say it is addictive. I HAVEN'T NOTICED. Been on it for over a year I take as needed. I think I need a higher dose but they want to get me off of it, the one thing that works for me, are they crazy. I do just fine on this why change it.",0,14
Xanax,As soon as I started taking Xanax I started to feel much better. I have had anxiety and panic attacks for years and Xanax has really helped me. I have had zero side effect from taking it. So far going well.,10,16
Xanax,"I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, so Xanax has served as my safety net in times of distress. When taken as prescribed, those of us who need it simply feel like life is bearable again. Those nagging irrational thought patterns and worries are silenced. However, Xanax is not a medicine to be taken lightly (hence the bad reputation it's received). It's short half-life causes cravings to re-dose (vs Klonopin, which never gives me those feelings). Use in moderation, and make an effort to see a cognitive-behavioral therapist if you haven't done so.",10,7
Xanax,I was in a car accident a few years ago. After that I had a panic attack when I would have to ride in a car. My doctor prescribed me 1 mg whenever I had to ride and it helped great. Now my doctor relocated and no other doctors will prescribe it. It causes problems between me and my wife.,10,9
Xanax,Xanax is wonderful for anxiety and panic attacks. I can thank this medication for making me a normal person. For being able to walk anywhere where there are people and feel absolutely no anxiety whatsoever. It's given me my life back.,10,21
Xanax,"I have lived with anxiety for five years and it has been a living nightmare. I struggle with trying to relax and calm after a long days' work. I am a mother, full-time employee and a recent college graduate (full-time, too). I have lived so long being stretched and now that I don't need to stretch that far, I have issues with trying to relax and take it easy. I am on Celexa and had to add Xanax to my regimen a year ago after having my first panic attack. I take 0.25mg as needed and sometimes before bed to help me sleep. Xanax has helped me calm my nerves and relax. Usually within the first half hour, I feel like I can chill out. It takes away the physical effects (shakiness and fast heart beat) and cools the mind and thought process.",9,13
Xanax,They work so good for me. I don't know what I would do without it.,10,11
Xanax,"I have been taking Xanax off and on for about 3 years now. It is great for anxiety. I spent thousands of dollars going to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack before it was brought to my attention that it was actually anxiety. I take 0.5mg as needed now. I noticed that when I stopped taking it that I could not sleep for days and I became shaky at times, and the anxiety returns immediately. The other thing that I notice is that after a while you become immune to the dosage. If you only take it with the onset of an anxiety or panic attack it shouldn't be a problem.",8,7
Xanax,"Xanax saved me from the brink. I suffer from panic disorder and anxiety and Xanax has been the only thing that works. The only thing: respect it. Don't drink alcohol on it or you will become highly intoxicated, and possibly get sleep apnea. Respect this drug and it will serve you well.",8,11
Xanax,"I was prescribed Xanax by my psychiatrist because of severe anxiety.  I was started on 1 mg to be taken at night. It has been the best medication prescribed for my condition as it also helped slow down the suicidal thoughts which were on a daily basis.  I am still taking Xanax under GP supervision, as it helps relieve the level of anxiety tremendously.  It is the best medication ever made for people who are born prone to anxiety throughout their childhood/adolescence and extreme shyness, yes shyness.  I also take it in conjunction with antidepressant, Aropax, which helped with my depression but also with my unfortunate disability of extreme shyness which was a constant problem for me as an adult basically all my life.",10,13
Xanax,Absolutely the best medication for anxiety. I have taken this medicine on and off for over twenty years and it has literally saved my life.  I too wish that people would stop abusing this medicine and that doctors would not fear prescribing it when necessary. It's been prescribed to me with antidepressants of different kinds and allowed me to live a normal life for the most part.,10,20
Xanax,"I've had anxiety issues my entire life. I honestly thought I was weird because I could not handle all the stress from my job and personal life. I don't have children, so again, I thought I had some severe mental issues! I tried Klonopin, WSellbutrin and Lexapro. All made me feel and act like a zombie. I am on Xanax 1mg 3x a day. Doing great, changed jobs now making more money without as much stress, happily married, and about to start law school. All good for now.",10,23
Xanax,"Changed my life completely, I can actually function in social settings.",10,4
Xanax,I have had depression since I was a teenager. I have tried pretty much anything you could think of. Nothing has helped me like Xanax. The problem is that doctors don't like to prescribe this medicine. I feel so lost without it and I would only take it when I really needed it. Only 2 or 3 times a week.,10,5
Xanax,"I feel like Xanax saved me. I had a very rough childhood with my father addicted to drugs, lost our house, had to raise my sisters because my mom had to get a full time job. I was going down a very bumpy road. I finally settled down with my now soon to be husband, and with the persuasion of him and my father (now sober, and also has anxiety) At age 18 I finally broke down and decided to go talk to a doctor. He prescribed me to multiple anti-depressants that made everything worse. He then put me on Xanax, I've never been so stress free. I have held down the same job, I'm doing well in school and again, and maintained a healthy relationship. I'm a changed person at 21 years old.",10,11
Xanax,Xanax is a miracle and cures my anxiety while I use it. I highly recommend it!,10,15
Xanax,"I have very severe generalized anxiety which sometimes manifests as the inability to leave my home (or sometimes, my room). I have other psychological issues as well and Xanax can reduce a manic or psychotic episode into almost nothing. I have been thinking of asking for extended release tablets. When I feel a serious panic attack coming on it is awesome to have something that stops the attack, and doesn't leave me too 'dopey' feeling to go back to work or whatever I was doing. Thanks Xanax.",10,16
Xanax,"I suffer from anxiety and was prescribed Cymbalta and Xanax. While they both worked, I didn't like the way Cymbalta made me feel and I had some of the more alarming side-effects, so I've switched over to just taking Xanax as needed and going to a psychotherapist, and I feel much much more in control of my anxiety. I only take 0.25mg as needed (when I feel my anxiety building) and find it to be perfect, I can calm myself down more quickly and still focus and work productively.",10,7
Xanax,"Xanax is something that I was afraid to take, given the fact that people with anxiety and panic attacks are usually scared of what the medicine is going to do.  I finally gave in and started taking my Xanax on a day when I needed to go to the Doctor which terrifies me.  I took the lowest dose, 0.25 mg and I am so thankful that I did.  No panic whatsoever at the Doctors office.  I so look forward to knowing that I will have something to take to help me get through panic situations that I have been avoiding for years.",10,12
Xanax,"I have been taking Xanax for 2 years. As soon as they put me on it I was like whoa! This is like a whole new world. I am bipolar, personalty disorder, mentally disabled and have anxiety. This medicine has helped me. I have started out on 1mg at night, then 2 months later a 2mg ER Xanax then they add a 2 mg bar at night and ever since things have been nice and all my moods have been at bay and anxiety has been down. Things are good.",0,10
Xanax,"I've never taken Xanax before up until now. I've tried Effexor, Viibryd, Wellbutrin, etc. but none of those worked at all and I could not handle the side effects. Xanax has given me my life back. My panic attacks have finally reduced, but more importantly I can continue to function in my normal everyday life. Most other medicines have me sitting on the couch in the evenings doing absolutely nothing as nothing seemed to matter. With Xanax, I can effectively handle my overwhelming daily task list!",9,9
Xanax,"This medication has been a God send for my chronic battle with anxiety and depression. A much safer alternative and also a much less expensive medicine than most barbituates, Xanax works very well on me and several of my fellow patients who suffer from anxiety.",9,7
Xanax,Amazing medicine,10,6
Xanax,"I have suffered from anxiety for years and tried to combat it without medicines.  I finally gave in and went to the doctor and was given Xanax.  This medicine has tremendously helped my anxiety. I take 0.50 mg as needed (about once a week). It begins working within 10 minutes and doesn't wear-off until 4-5 hours later, which is perfect for me.  It can make me a little drowsy, but not to the point where I feel like I'm going to fall asleep while I'm in public.  I have never been addicted to this medicine, as I've been very careful to ONLY take it when I really need it.",10,11
Xanax,"Too make a long story short, a little over 2 weeks ago after an MRI, we were told our daughter had a birth defect called Chiari which required brain surgery, which is scheduled for September 9, 2011.  My anxiety was so bad I couldn't function normally and couldn't stop crying, couldn't sleep, had chest pains and my head was so lightheaded I thought I would pass out. Xanax stopped all of it. I only rate it an 8, not because of how it works, but because of me. I still can't control my anxiety without help from Xanax. Now I can sleep, breath and only cry once a day if at all. I'm seeing a shrink and feeling stronger so maybe soon I will be in control of myself again and handle my families life again as a strong mom and woman.",8,10
Xanax,"I've been on Alprazolam (Xanax) for over five years now.  I take 2mg four times a day.  Xanax is the only medication, when taken as prescribed, that allows me to manage my anxiety and panic disorder.  I have my Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), My Severe Panic Disorder, My Antisocial tendencies, My Social Anxiety, My insecurity's and even my Agoraphobia all to a tolerable level. Xanax has greatly improved the quality of my life. If you can't find anything else that works, ask your doctor about Alprazolam.",10,14
Xanax,"This medicine is great. No side effects. Calms me down. Helps with the racing thoughts at night and to relax and get to sleep. I also had panic attacks, now with Xanax they are gone. I only take 0.5mg at night and as needed when nervous or with social anxiety if I go out. It works wonders. It is sad that many doctors do not want to prescribe it because of stigma of abuse and it really would help many people with anxiety disorders.",10,8
Xanax,I have emphysema related anxiety and Xanax is the only thing that helps me. It does not get rid of the anxiety attacks but is strong enough to manage getting my anxiety attack under control. The quality of my life is unbearable without this medication.,10,3
Xanax,"Xanax for panic attacks saved my life. I had developed agoraphobia after 9 months or so of severe panic. I was prescribed Xanax for occasional use by a very smart doctor and just knowing I had them to rely on if I needed them was enough to end the cycle of panic. If you panic, they work quickly to end the attack. I know that people have trouble with withdrawal if they're used for too long. I did my best to breathe through the attacks and fend them off myself, but when I couldn't Xanax was a savior.",10,9
Xanax,Calms my anxiety better then anything else. When I have anxiety attacks and take one or two Xanax I actually feel normal again and a lot more outgoing and I'm not so shy or afraid to meet and talk to new people that I may meet.,10,6
Xanax,Effectively and rapidly eliminates symptoms of my anxiety.  Also works well in calming my thoughts down.  Only downside of this medication that I can conjure up is a propensity to make me lethargic...but this is only a significant problem if I'm not engaged in some sort of physical or mental diversion.,8,3
Xanax,I have two small children and it can be a lot to deal with on a daily basis. My doctor prescribed 1mg twice a day and it has helped tremendously with taking care of my daily activities and not being so stressed out all the time. I would say to anybody with a problem with stress or raising small kids it definitely helps make things a lot more bearable.,10,7
Xanax,"It's sad. Ever since I was a child I've had anxiety problems and it only seems to get worse with age. I've used Xanax for years to help control it, when it feels like I'm going to have a heart attack (racing heart) or I start shaking so bad I can't even think straight. Xanax worked wonders for me. Now my MD. wants to stop it. I'm on Cymbalta and unfortunately, I find it a very poor substitute. As I find it doesn't do 'The Great Job Xanax Did'.",10,7
Xanax,I have been on Xanax for a few years for anxiety and panic attacks and have found Xanax to be very helpful and not as addictive as many other medications.,10,11
Xanax,"Xanax (Alprazolam) is a good drug for anxiety and panic disorder, is wonderful while you're taking it. But I know to leave this medicine is so painful and has many unpleasant effects on the withdrawal. It works great for me.",8,7
Xanax,"I started taking Xanax at age 20 and it was a great medicine. I had such bad panic attacks and just constant anxiety 24/7.  I started out on a low dose and within 15 mins I felt calm and fine. I got from the place of not being able to walk outside or answer the phone to being able to get married, have a job, go on vacations. Anything I wanted to do. I WAS NORMAL.  But now I'm 36 and on the highest dose 4 mg a day and about 4 1/2 years ago my horrible anxiety came back even though I'm taking it.  I can't work, drive or really go anywhere anymore.  So I guess I'd say it works but then you may build up a tolerance and then it won't work.",6,14
Xanax,"I was taking 4mg of Xanax almost daily for about a year. I tried to quit cold turkey by being off of them for about 4 days straight and when day 5 hit me I thought I was going to die. I couldn't sleep for the 4 days I didn't have it, constant pacing around the house, twitches like crazy and had to get some ASAP as I was out. It has been over a month now and I am slowly coming off of the Xanax. I am down to about 1mg every 2 days or so and I haven't had any additional medications. It can be done but you have to prepare yourself for it mentally and tell yourself you CAN do it. I have quit in the past and regret ever picking up the bottle again.",2,17
Xanax,"Xanax is an excellent medicine for myself. It has prevented panic attacks and helped me through times of rough anxiety. Ativan never worked for me and Klonopin makes me drunk-like and put me in the hospital 3 times. The hospital finally said I have an allergy to Klonopin and could no longer take it. After going on Xanax, I felt so much better and relieved. I try not to take Xanax everyday, as it is not meant to be a long-term solution to anxiety and can be very addicting, so be very careful. I am on Paxil CR and Risperdal on top of Xanax for my anxiety, PTSD, panic disorder, and OCD.",10,8
Xanax,"Xanax has really helped me relax. I have severe anxiety, depression and PTSD. I take Seroquel XR and recently my doctor switched me from Xanax to Atarax. The Atarax did not work at all. I have suffered from anxiety for years and the only thing that has been effective is Xanax. I would recommend this to anyone who has moderate to severe anxiety. It does have a high addiction rate, so be extremely careful when taking this.",10,6
Xanax,"Excellent medicine for anxiety, depression and insomnia.",10,8
Xanax,"I typically dislike and try to avoid taking medications whenever possible, but with a recent anxiety diagnosis, I was convinced to at least keep some of this on hand in case I need it.  I must say that I LOVE Xanax.  It really calms me down within about 20 minutes of taking it and helps me sleep almost irrespective of what is going on, but it doesn't leave a hangover effect the next morning.  I'm currently in the phase of trying to find a more regular medication to control my anxiety/OCD (currently trying venlafaxine), as the Xanax isn't meant to be a daily thing. In the meantime, I'm still using this when I feel I need it.  Ativan and Valium don't compare.",10,7
Xanax,"Starting on .25 dosage and has helped my anxiety enormously. Have to say that has also helped my depression as well. I got my 1st good noghts sleep in months. Helps with panic attacks as well. I think sleep depravation plays a major role in scattered thoughts and feeling of hopelessness. Once we start getting back to regular sleep patterns, we can all feel sane and less overwhelmed in our everyday lives! Good luck to all!",10,25
Xanax,"With the death of my mom in June 2009 I immediately started having nausea and vomiting, couldn't eat, couldn't concentrate. I thought I was dying myself.  Every time I tried to go to sleep I could feel my heart beating furiously through my chest.  I wanted to die myself. My Doctor finally prescribed Xanax after a horrible episode of just trying to drive home from his office. I had to stop about 20 times because I was crying so bad. He said I was suffering from PTSD. Without Xanax I do not think I would have been able to handle all the legal paperwork that I had to do, plus work. Now in 2010 we had to close our business and have lost my job. The whole episode has started up again. I hope the increased dose will help and I can continue my life.",9,15
Xanax,"I think that this is one of the best medicines out there. I take 2 mg four times a day and it just seems to keep me calm and make the world a better place. I used to stress out about the smallest things now, I just go with the flow.",10,19
Xanax,"I have chronic interstitial cystitis (not sure on spelling) also called painful bladder syndrome.  It is like a urinary tract infection times 10. I have to go to bathroom any where from every 30 minutes up to 2 times every 2 hours. So it can be a problem if I'm away from home. If I take my Xanax 0.5mg, I usually don't have to go to bathroom but once every 3 or 4 hrs and since it hurts so bad to urinate and plus I can get sleep at night with not having to go every hour. It has been such a relief.  I rate it a 9. My doctor has it written 1 or 2 every 8 hours as needed, but I try to only take it at night. I'm very cautious.",9,10
Xanax,My anxiety is so much under control now.,10,8
Xanax,"About 15 yrs ago I started taking Xanax. 0.25mg morning and afternoon. It worked wonders. Then the doctors put me on Paxil. I weaned myself off the Xanax, it took about 4 months. But I always have it on hand for the tough times which seem in abundance lately.  It acts quickly and has been a life saver for me.",9,10
Xanax,I was prescribed this medication in the hospital after suffering severe anxiety attacks. I was only given a couple to get me through until I see my doctor but I found out the doctors are unwilling to give you this medication. I have anxiety attacks everyday but this medication makes me stay calm so I don't suffer from these awful anxiety attacks. I feel relief and that I can go on.,10,10
Xanax,I think it's a great medicine but I only take it as needed since its so fast acting.,10,8
Xanax,"At first I didn't like the fact of taking medicine everyday, but ever since the day my doctor(physiciatrist) prescribed this to me at first a little drowsy in the morning, but a couple days I felt great especially in the morning. If you have anxiety like me it will make you feel like a whole new man without always being tight and chest feels heavy and sweating could go on. XANAX is a wonderful medicine.",0,8
Xanax,Works wonders and helps with my little social-phobia and it also helps for my depression (with Zoloft).,10,10
Xanax,"I've tried many other non-addictive medications and none of them helped my anxiety the way Xanax does. After several other medications, (and hesitation on my part) my doctor finally prescribed me Xanax 1 mg 2-3 times daily depending on my level of anxiety that day. I ended up breaking most of the pills in half and only taking 0.5 mg usually 3x a day, and find it relieves my anxiety without the level of sleepiness a whole mg gives me. I usually only take a whole pill if I feel a panic attack coming on. But, I'll take the mild drowsiness any day over the level of constant anxiety I had prior to starting the drug, and a couple cups of coffee usually does me good. I can definitely tell when a dose starts to wear off though, some withdrawal.",8,16
Xanax,"I recently realized I have had anxiety practically my whole life. Being thirty years old now, I really wish I had been prescribed this a long time ago. It has reduced my shaking and anxiety effects so much that I feel like a real person.  I never knew what it was like to feel calm until now.  I am very thankful for this medicine.",9,28
Xanax,"Was prescribed this by the VA after retiring from the military. Am new to it but it makes my life so much better! Have had HORRIBLE panic and anxiety attacks for years even before I knew what they were. Driving, meetings, interacting in groups, you name it. So far so good, it really helps!",10,22
Xanax,Completely takes away my anxiety but distorts my memory a bit.,10,14
Xanax,"Excellent for anxiety, especially if you start with the minimum amount, 0.25 mg and only take more if needed. I say this because I was prescribed 0.5 mg 3x daily and don't need that much. Try to take the least amount and if that works don't take more since you can build up a slight tolerance over time. My only concern is will I ever be able to be off of medicine. I just wish there was a natural cure for anxiety. I hate being dependent on this.",10,193
Xanax,These are the best for my anxiety.,10,15
Xanax,My doctor prescribed medication for depression. I have tried three different kinds and had terrible side effects. I am taking Xanax occasionally when anxiety or panic occur and it works for me just great. Generic version alprazolam takes a little longer to kick in.,10,20
Xanax,"Having suffered panic attacks and anxiety and depression for several years now, always have my Xanax with me in case of any unexpected panic attacks. I take 90mg of Avanza each night in addition to 2mg of Xanax twice a day. Xanax for me has been the only drug that has quick and fast acting results. I don't like flying or heights or crowds and avoid shopping centers but with Xanax can at least function each day and at least leave the house. Good luck to everyone else out there suffering the same. Try Xanax it works for me. Cheers.",7,30
Xanax,"I have suffered with anxiety and panic attacks for years. It got so bad I would actually be driving, pull over to the side of the road and call 911 because I thought I was having a heart attack, it was really scary. I've been on Xanax for 10 years off and on. I take 0.5mg once a day when I start feeling anxious and my insides feel out of control. It does frighten me to think I could be addicted to this medication, but on the other hand if it relieves my symptoms than I guess I need to take Xanax as needed.",9,29
Xanax,Less panic attacks and helps keep you relaxed and open minded. Less stress keeps you panic free and it lowers the stress at least 75% while on the Xanax compared to Lexapro and many others I tried for anxiety and depression.,10,22
Xanax,This drug is a life saver! Just don't abuse it.,9,28
Xanax,It works wonders. Xanax has made my life so much easier. I am on 2mg 3x a day and I feel like I'm happier and more out going. I don't know what I would do without it ...I give it** 5 *stars**.,10,39
Xanax,"I have taken alprazolam for about 2 weeks now and it has really helped control my anxiety.  I had my first panic attack and then started getting them everyday and they would last all day.  For the first 3 or 4 days I had to take alprazolam every 5 hours (3 times a day).  Then I would get the panic attacks when I woke up (9 am) and then around 5pm, so then I took 2 pills a day for about 4 days.  Now I am down to one pill in the morning because I keep waking up with anxiety.  The alprazolam works in the first 20 minutess but my anxiety gets a little worse when I take it and then it gets so much better!  The downside is the bad taste, causes drowsiness, loss of appetite and weight, and is highly addictive.  Great for temporary relief!",9,15
Xanax,"I have been prescribed alprazolam (Xanax) and a variety of other benzodiazipines for the past ten years when I was first diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, my dosage is 2mg 2 x daily. This was recently reduced from 2mg 3 x daily and I admit I do suffer a little but I make the best of it. The most important thing about Xanax is it is addictive and NEVER suddenly stop taking it! You could suffer from what's called a Benzodiazipine withdrawal seizure. You need to taper your dose down. This is a PROPER and safe way to wean off. But overall, wonderful medicine for anxiety!",9,44
Xanax,"Amazing for anxiety and panic disorders but another wonderful thing about Xanax is it will even help take the edge off of the common cold and the flu. I have carpal tunnel, arthritis and osteoporosis an it helps relax the joints and muscles just enough to get a good nights sleep. A wonder drug. It does have some major downfalls also like long-term deppendency.",10,19
Xanax,"It works great for panic attacks, but is horrible as you feel it wear off.  Klonopin is much better!",3,20
Xanax,"I have suffered from depression, OCD, and anxiety disorder for most of my life.  I did not know until recently that doctors will treat panic disorders and I didn't have to life with constant fear and stress including vomiting 4-5 times daily, diarrhea, going days and weeks without sleeping, and general feelings of dread.  I have been on and off anti-depressants since my late 20s, but never knew this was also treatable till now.  I am very disappointed that I have virtually no reaction to Xanax either positive or negative - I could be swallowing placebos as far as I can tell.  The panic does not abate, I still feel like the world is coming to an end and I'm vomiting all the time.  I don't get sleepy or alert, I simply get no reaction at all. Given how much press there is about this being habit forming and addictive Im assuming my reaction or lack thereof is a-typical.",0,10
Xanax,"I am prescribed Xanax 0.5 mg twice daily. At 21 yrs old and have a speech impairment due to major anxiety. Xanax helps greatly to calm me down and be able to control my nervousness. I've tried Vistaril, Buspar, Seroquel, Paxil and nothing comes close to working as well as Xanax does! It works pretty fast when real anxious and makes me to be much much more outgoing and motivated throughout the day. I'm taking 40mg Celexa with Xanax which is a wonderful combination. I'm very fidigity and uncalm, but with Xanax, I feel how I should be. While being less anxious and more outgoing, I also feel a very floaty state of mind. Xanax helps!",9,26
Xanax,"Works great for my anxiety attacks, but after 6 years I've gone from 0.25 mg twice a day to 1mg twice a day.  Getting anxious about what will happen when this dose stops working.",8,20
Xanax,"I've tried everything for anxiety - which is severe ALL the time. XANAX WORKS! Only issue is the length of time it lasts; I can feel the effects almost immediately (within 20 minutes and continue to feel effects kicking in for a good hour after), but after about 3 hours, I start to have rebound anxiety from it wearing off. Be careful of tolerance though. Since I've been on it, I've had to increase 4x. I started of with 0.5mg 3x/day and am now on 1mg, 5x/day. I don't want to change that, but this seems to be a perfect. It gives me the relief I need as often as my body seems to need it. I am so grateful for this drug, as my panic is non-existent, where it hasn't been in YEARS. It's been non stop - never relief. I finally feel relief.",9,62
Xanax,"I am prescribed 0.5mg Xanax twice a day as needed.  It works very well for me when I have high anxiety.  I have no side effects at all from this drug, I don't even get sleepy with it, I just feel calmer.  I have taken a variety of benzodiazepines for years, and I have never had a problem with an addiction to any of them (and I have a history of drug abuse).  I would just say to take as needed and at the correct dose, and don't take continuously for a long time, and you should do good with Xanax.",9,48
Xanax,"I am a 19 year old male prescribed to a 0.5mg dosage of Xanax to be taken twice daily. Depending on my spouts of anxiety or an occasional panic attack, I either take one or a half of one to calm my state of mind. I try to just take a half of one because this medication can be addicting. I noticed these effects and feelings right after my first intake. It does indeed help suppress my anxiety and panic attacks. Due to the addiction prone aspects I'm giving it an 8.",8,13
Xanax,"I was the caregiver for 2 family members from 1997 to 2008.  I had the first full-blown stress panic attack in 2005.  Xanax was one of my medications and in 6 months, I was off drugs.  I have no regrets for those 11 years, but thought I was finally free to live my life.  However, I was wrong.  I now have continuous anxiety if I don't take 0.25 mg Xanax in the morning and evening.  I also have very high blood pressure to which a solution has not been found.  Xanax does lower it and I couldn't keep my sanity without it.  I have had no negative side effects, only positive.",10,32
Xanax,I had 2 panic attacks in my entire life. I went to a Doctor and was given Xanax at half mg to take immediately and 6 hrs later. It worked and I thought I would keep some handy for any possible future attacks. He prescribed 0.25mg pills 3 times a day. I looked it up on the internet and didn't like the information on addiction. I went to my Doctor when I got back home and he prescribed Ativan. I believe Xanax should be used only when having a panic attack and not as a maintenance drug.,6,18
Xanax,"I was prescribed 0.25mg of Xanax for my hyper-anxiety and panic attacks.  As a 200lb man I needed a 0.5mg dose.  Xanax really solves panic attacks well, and noticeably helps with my anxiety.  It makes it much easier to fall asleep which is great at bedtime, but can be a real problem in the morning.  Reading Feeling Good by Dr. David Burns also really helped treat the thoughts that led to panic and anxiety.",9,17
Xanax,Works okay four me.,0,8
Xanax,"I use Xanax (1mg) for anxiety and panic disorder. This medicine has been the only drug that has brought relief to to my constant anxiety. I don't know where I'd be without it. I take the use of this drug very seriously and don't abuse it. I use it only when needed for panic or when anxiety is so intense I simply can't tolerate it any longer. When used properly this drug is safe and you will not become addicted. It's very fast acting (15 min) which is important when a panic attack hits. Side effects are minimal for me. I get the jelly legs and that's about it. It's never made me stumble or fall though. The generic version isn't quite as good as the real stuff, but if you must use generic, the round blue tabs are better than the oval ones.",10,26
Xanax,I found that Xanax is the only thing that can calm my panic disorder. I take 4mg a day and I have not had an attack in about 3 months.,10,14
Xanax,I personally truly enjoy the fact that while my anxieties are prominent; the Xanax provides me with the security to take a deep breath and if things become too overwhelming I have the option of taking it when needed.,9,16
Xanax,"I was switched onto this drug after taking lorazepam (Ativan) which I was very happy with and had almost no side effects with. I started taking it combined with Effexor, and it was horrible. I would take it, pass out for an hour, and wake up feeling the same as before. I could see how it would be good for a panic attack, but for general anxiety it is not very good. If you are on a constant dose, you will be taking them about 3 to 4 times a day which is too much to keep up with. I also found much more intense effects from this drug, which I consider dangerous because I don't want to get addicted to them. I think the drug is good for anxiety attacks, but for general anxieties I would ask for lorazepam or klonopin.",6,17
Xanax,"I have been diagnosed with both Dysautonomia and GAD. I cannot take SSRI's as they throw me into an extreme panic state starting with pill one. I finally gave in and accepted Xanax from my doctor. My dosage is 0.05 3 times a day. I never take the prescribed dose but rather 1/2 pill in the morning, daytime if needed and I rarely take at night. My life has done a complete turnaround. I have energy again, I'm not so tense, snappy or experiencing the extreme anxiety that would peak at around 2pm. I'm careful to take as I need, and while doctors may not like prescribing it, the truth is many of us will be on medication forever. I've found something that doesn't feel like medication, I just feel like me.",10,61
Xanax,Great.,10,8
Xanax,"After years of talk down therapy, I reached a breaking point. A Doc gave me Xanax and it was a miracle. I was able to go to stores and travel on airlines without Panic Attacks. I have been on Xanax since 1999, .25 Mg before bedtime. This has given me my life back. I do take more for long flights where I spend 12 to 24 hours inside the airline system. I started on .25 Mg daily and 10 years later still use the same amount. If I miss a dose more than a day, I get antsy, then clammy skin and finally unjustified panic attack on 3rd or 4th day. This is well expected and acceptable response to quitting abruptly. Doc has been up front about me using this or some other drug for the rest of my life. It is well worth it.",10,30
Xanax,Xanax is the best anxiety medication that I have taken over the past several years. I have been prescribed at least ten or more different medicines and some work to an extent but none are near as effective than Xanax. Xanax has truly been a lifesaver (hands down) for my anxiety and panic attacks.,9,27
Xanax,This medicine saved my life after my mother died and shortly after my daughters father was killed. It helped me relax and I was a lot easier to take it day by day. A great alternative to alcohol.,10,22
Xanax,"I use Xanax occasionally as required. I feel relaxed in real sense, feel increase in mental abilities, sleep well and when I wake up I'm in a very fresh mood.",10,28
Xanax,Very good for anxiety and I think it helps for depression.,10,17
Xanax,"Xanax was a God send when I was in a terrible car accident and lost my best friend. I knew that it was a controlled substance, so that made me wearly. I recently got into a relationship, and my boyfriends whole family is highly addicted to Xanax. They are prescribed them, buy them off the street, and so on. They fight each other for bars and pay a fortune for them. The family is a complete wreck. family members had forgotten important things, like family matters, misplacing wallets, purses etc... even getting into car accidents while they're on them. They helped me when I took them as prescribed, but seeing how my boyfriends family act while on the drug, I would be careful.",1,52
Xanax,"Found the brand name was by far more effective than generic alprazolam. I find typically I do much better with brand names than generics, depending on your co pays I'd go for the brand names, the difference in my insurance is generics are 3 and brand is 6 so it's a world of a difference to me. I felt or 'thought' the Xanax wasn't working, but realized I was on generic alprazolam and switched it, it was like night and day.",10,30
Xanax,"I have been on Alprazolam for 10 years for panic disorder and anxiety.  I am still on the same dosage that I was ten years ago and I am definitely sure that drug companies differ in their drug production.   Whenever I pick up a prescription and the pharmacy tells me it's just a different company, the red flag goes up.  The oval shaped 1 mg. tablet just does not work as well at the round 1 mg. tablet.",6,30
Xanax,"Medication works fast - I received instant results. Amazing. If I only knew before, I could have experienced less miserable days.",10,29
Xanax,It works great for me.,0,10
Xanax,"They are a huge help, I have post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and agoraphobia and if I didn't have Xanax don't think I could go out of the house. I also have seizures and take Topamax. Everything got worse when my libido passed! Now I can do the things I used to do!",10,10
Xanax,"I had anxiety so bad from work I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. I didn't take it until I got home from work because it made me sleep. I was on it for 6 weeks and I noticed I had an addiction to it. I was hurrying home after work to take it (no, really doctor, I can stop it any time I want to). My doctor said to stop taking it. I was awake for 3 days but I did it. I know now that I needed to reduce it a little at a time because I had been taking a high dose for a while. It's a life saver for bad anxiety, just watch the dosage and be careful about how long you are taking it. If you keep those 2 things in mind it's the best anti-anxiety medicine.",10,40
Xanax,Xanax works well for me with my fear of flying.  I have to take it on an empty stomach otherwise it does not work.  It makes me sleep on the flight to get to where I need to go.  The one problem that I am having is memory loss.  I cannot remember the events that happened the day that I take it.  It makes me very passive.,0,31
Xanax,"The fastest acting anti anxiety medication I've ever been prescribed, and by far the most effective.  The anxiety I experienced prior to medication was crippling, I would stay in bed all day and not want to leave my house to go to school, or anything that involved other social interaction.  This medicine got me up, happy, and willing/wanting to do the things I could not do before.  However, through prolonged use of this medication I have as a result become addicted, as when I do not receive my scheduled dose I feel withdrawals.  Overall - this medication has done so many good things for me I would be content taking this until the end of time, for the pros outweigh the cons, tenfold.",10,82
Xanax,It made me tired and didn't relieve my anxiety.,1,15
Xanax,"I suffer from anxiety to the point where I am scared of things. It was so bad I wanted to pull my hair out. I was adopted when I was just a few days old, My mother ( who adopted me) died when I was 16. Life just seemed so hard for me. I was prescribed Klonopin and Ativan before Xanax, now I take Xanax and Concerta together and it really has changed my life. I work two jobs and go to college. I have become a superstar at work, winning contests and getting along with everyone, I rate this drug a 10 it is incredible!",10,78
Xanax,The best,10,18
Xanax,"I have had severe panic attacks all my life. I don't even know how to explain what this makes you fell like, it's like you can't catch your breath, your hands start to go numb. My head goes numb. Then I felt like I am going to pass out or am having a stroke. I have nothing but a positive experience with this medicine and I have tried other's. They didn't work. I have never had any side effects with Xanax. So 1-10 its a 10, but take only as prescibed.",10,40
Xanax,"Xanax worked wonders for my anxiety. Next thing I know, I only ate one meal every four days and lost 15 pounds in two weeks. Withdrawal is the worst. I vomited for seven weeks straight and at least twice a day. I've been clean for two months I still don't sleep until five/six in the morning. I have slight muscle tremors. Prescriptions must be monitored extremely carefully.",4,84
Xanax,Love it. It made me really relaxed/calm and still able to do my work.,10,30
Xanax,I have cancer and this drug takes my mind of death and is a great sleep aid.,10,88
Xanax,"When I start to pace around the room, swimming in my non-stop traffic of thoughts I know I need to take my Xanax, it calms me and I even stopped smoking out of anxiety.",9,39
Xanax,I have been on Xanax for about 3 years and I used to have really bad panic attacks but I don't now. The only problem I have with them is that they have made me gain a ton of weight.,10,24
Xanax,I found Xanax to be the only thing to help me.,7,36
Xanax,"I have used Xanax for the past 15 years for moderate to severe panic and or anxiety attacks. Were it not for this drug, I am not sure what I would have done. It was and still is a God send. I only use it as needed as opposed to daily use. Two downsides are that it makes me drowsy and if I drink alcohol when I have taken it, I get very testy.  Don't drink and drive and don't drive while on Xanax.",10,44
Xanax,"Xanax is the best medicine. I was dizzy for two months straight. I felt like I was on a boat and couldn't get off. My whole life was just a mess between working full time, school, personal life until I found Xanax. I am on 0.5mg twice a day and I have my life back. I can tolerate people again. This is the wonder drug. Other than being a little more tired than normal, which I will suffer through because it is better than biting people's heads off every chance I got.",10,136
Xanax,Wonderful drug.,10,15
Xanax,This drug helps with anxiety so much. I'm taking 0.5mg only when I need it. It works great.,10,66
Xanax,Xanax made me crazy. I am now in the process of weaning off of it. You cannot stop Xanax cold turkey. It'll be another two weeks before I'm done.,2,47
Xanax,"Xanax has probably helped keep me alive and breathing over the last two years.  The toll of being a military wife, mom, full-time worker, etc. had me so stressed out that I began to procrastinate on EVERYTHING because I couldn't emotionally handle things like paying bills, running errands, etc.  I only take 0.5mg of Xanax as needed, but just knowing it's in my purse helps me keep my busy life moving ahead.  Combined with Zoloft for depression and Ambien for insomnia, I finally feel like a normal person.  I feel sorry for the woman I used to be, but I'm so happy to be myself now.",9,206
Xanax,Xanax is the most effective non-habit forming medication for me.  I have severe general anxiety disorder.,10,29
Xanax,My daughter passed away in November and I kept getting nausea like motion sickness to the point I couldn't eat and I would throw up.  Xanax is the only thing that has helped me to start eating again and keeps from me crying all the time.  I take 1/2 a blue one at bed time and another 1/2 one later in the day and I can function and not have so many flash backs.,0,40
Xanax,I take 0.5 mg as needed when I have an occasional anxiety attack,9,29
Xanax,"GREAT for anxiety. The ONLY problem I've had is after taking it regularly, when I try to reduce the dosage or frequency, my anxiety increases.",9,67
Xanax,This is amazing for anxiety / panic attacks. I could nt be without this for when my anxiety levels peak. Its the onlt thing that works that brings me back down some bit and relaxes me. It really is a god send for anxiety / panic. I am taking this 2 years now but only take it when I really need it. Would highly highly highly recommend this. Its just brillant and side effects are non existent as far as I am concerned. I take the 250mg dose which is a white tab,9,35
Xanax,Prescibed Xanax for my anxiety and panic disorder.  This drug is a God send for me as I take it along with BuSpar and only when those escalating anxiety and panic monsters show their faces.  It is fast acting and will help to prevent you from going to the full blown attack.  The downsides is that the doctors do not like to write the scripts for this.,9,32
Xanax,Xanax helps with my condition,5,13
Xanax,I love this drug. It's the only one that really works.,8,31
Xanax,It is very helpful.,10,16
Xanax,If it is taken as your Doctor says then it is a really effective in treating anxiety.,9,29
Xanax,Works very well for anxiety. Stay far away from any alcohol consumption while taking this medicine.,9,37
Xanax,During the recession of the early 90's I took this drug for a period of about 2 months to combat anxiety. The doctor first tried prozac but that didn't work for me at all. As soon as I started taking Xanax I began to feel better. I was able to put worrying thoughts into perspective. I highly recommend it.,10,69
Xanax,"Xanax is a miracle for me. I can't live without it. It is not addicting. I never experienced withdrawl symptoms either. I am usually tense, high strung and anxious. Xanax makes me happy, easy going, talkative, calm. It helps me sleep, I can't sleep without it. I take zoloft and seroquel but without xanax nothing seems to work or help me. I love xanax and I take it daily or else I really just can't get through the day. I have anger and a short fuse and bad temper and xanax calms my storms. Xanax is the only thing that works for me and makes me sane and able to face life head on.",10,410
Xanax,"I don't have panic or depression problems. I have sleeping problems. I fall asleep fine, but wake up around 2 AM and cannot go back to sleep because my mind is too active thinking about stupid stuff like movies, lawn mowers, hunting, visiting my grandkids, working on my car, music, planned projects, football, YOU NAME IT. I take Xanax when I wake up earky and can't sleep. Xanax makes me go back to sleep almost immediately and I wake up around 6 AM feeling great. I have not noted any side effects, but I take it only when needed.",10,234
Xanax,"My anxiety gave me depersonalization. Whenever I take xanax it clears right up for me, especially if I run out of Klonopin. It's a great back up that helps me when that sudden feeling of panic creeps up on me.",10,27
Xanax,Tend to have dreams while on this drug.,3,20
Xanax,It helped.,10,21
Xanax,"After taking this medication I feel very tranquil. I am an easy going person when I take it. I am calm and I don't have that high feeling I hate. I am coherent but calm. No one really bothers me. It's a miracle because before I used it my husband used to get on my nerves, my kids would get under my skin at the grocery market. I wanted to knock out someone but now I am a nice calm person that can be approached and even has fun.",10,142
Xanax,There is not a better drug than xanax for my anxiety.  I love it!  Thanks to this drug I can do simple things like go to my kids schools with out going into a panic attack!,10,69
Xanax,AnnetAndre9,9,2
Xanax,"Xanax has helped me tremedously,  I do not suffer from any of the side effects that are listed.  Since being on this drug for my anxiety, I have been given part of my life back. I didn't like to be in crowds of people or go to social events and since I am on this medicine I no longer suffer from these anxieties.",10,135
Xanax,Xanax is the only thing that works for me.,10,42
Xanax,This medicine works great for me.,10,22
Xanax,"This drug works wonders on most people including myself.  It calmed my panic, it helped my depression and helped me see life for what it is instead of worrying about every little problem.",8,113
Xanax,One of the best benzodiazepines I have taken.,8,32
Xanax,Excellent. I don't know what I would do without it. I love it.,10,55
Xanax,"I used to get very aggravated over what normal people handle. I would go off. Have panic attacks and not know how to deal. Plus, I have tremors in my hands, mostly my right. Once I started taking Xanax the tremors stopped, I could deal calmly with my children when they got out of control. It helps me concentrate easier during the day &amp; sleep well @ nite. It can have side affects though if you don't take it properly! Take it as prescribed and don't make yourself go through the withdrawals.",10,227
Xanax,It makes me mellow.,9,62
Xanax,"This drug has changed my life. I have always had an anxiety problem since I was a child. Didn't have a good childhood, got picked on because I was fat, etc. My parents always faught and everything would just worry me. Some nights I couldn't sleep. I've been suffering from anxiety and panic attacks for so long. I feel like people are talking bad about me. I used to get paranoid and get really anxious in public and had social pobia. I can cope with everything now.",10,537
Xanax,I have agraphobia (social disorder) I was confinde to my home to scared to get in a situation I couldnt get out of. My fiance was always trying to get me out of the house.

Xanax,It works really well.,9,58
Xanax,helps me very well with my condition.,10,39
Xanax,the 1mg xanax made my life easyer to live. before i thought everyone was talkin about me and couldnt sleep but now im the life of the party,10,90
Xanax,"Xanax has helped me tremendously, I was having severe anxiety attacks real bad! My doctor at the time worked next door with in the same buliding/office, and he had witnessed my attacks and finally prescribed me just 1 mg Xanax, and he told me to take 1 half in the morning and 1 half at evening. It took a while but finally I was attack free. I feel like I can live my life now!",10,158
Xanax,"I wish doctors would open their eyes and prescribe this medicine easier.  Just because I panic easily doesn't mean I'm a psychotic.  Docs, lighten up!  I need them!",7,353
Lorazepam,"I have severe anxiety disorder. And Lorazepam is my life saving drug. Last time I was taking 2.5 mg/day of it for 5 months and I got addicted to the pills. My doctor prescribed me Trazodone to help me overcome my Lorazepam addiction. And just after 1,5 month I was completely okay again. Those who struggle with the Lorazepam addiction, ask your doctor about Trazodone treatment. I live in Italy and here it's a common treatment for Lorazepam addiction.",9,2
Lorazepam,"<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 I have been on Ativan 1mg for almost three years now and whenever Im super angry, anxious, jumpy it works wonders. For the past week Ive been crying uncontrollably because of certain things going on and when people dont show me any concern or comfort me I get irrationally angry and even chased my little sister for showing no sympathy. Im a 23 year old woman and shes a 16 year old girl so shes got her own problems. I immediately took an Ativan and within 20 minutes they kicked in perfectly. I didnt have an urge to cry anymore, I felt calm and relaxed, And kind of high and had a rational thought process. This is what effects Ativan usually has on me and sometimes I feel goofy and laugh at the most random things. But regardless I ?? This drug and couldnt ask for better. Ive been on clonazepam thats ok but not as good as Ativan and Ive been on Xanax once at the hospital but that made me even more anxious and my muscles jerked. I love Ativan so much",0,6
Lorazepam,This stuff does NOT work. My doctor prescribed it as a sleep aid and I'm back awake 2 hours later I don't even feel drowsy.,1,11
Lorazepam,I have been taking Ativan 1 mg 3x day as needed for probably 6 years.  It worked well for a while for my anxiety and was good because it didnt knock me out.  I was still able to function and not feel like I was in a fog.  Now its become completely ineffective.  Tolerance built up and I have a lot of anxiety again.  I keep taking it because I have to or things will be even worse.  It feels like Im just taking it for no reason though because its not doing its job.  Im trying to get my doctor to change it to something else.,3,16
Lorazepam,"I. Love. This. Drug. I take Prozac for my anxiety which helps stabilize me day to day wonderfully, but when my thoughts are racing and my therapy techniques arent working and Im on the verge of a panic attack this drug lorazepam works wonders. Ill take .5mg and my mind goes quiet and calm within thirty minutes. If I take at night I fall asleep quickly, but I also have no problem staying awake on it if I take during the day. Lorazepam renders you a happy calm and the slightest bit loopy, but not in an incapacitating way. Ive never experienced any negative side effects or withdrawal symptoms, likely because I take it very sparingly. Which leads me to... IMPORTANT NOTE: My doctor has warned me of how highly addictive this drug is so I only take it as a last resort, I have only taken ten pills in one and a half years. From all I have read and from my doctors warnings I would never use this as a daily drug- thats what meds like Prozac are for!",10,26
Lorazepam,"I woke up one day in March 2018. It was a normal day,  nothing had happened in my life so I have no idea why it happened . Ive never had a panic attacks or anything like that.  Just felt anxious every day and I couldnt sleep . I  tried Lexapro, Zoloft none of them worked. My doctor prescribed me  0.5 mg Lorazepam twice a day,  that worked great for a while but then I started taking them both at the same time between 9:30 AM and 10 AM and it has done wonders. Doesnt cause any drowsiness I get through my workday just fine and I immediately started sleeping much better.",10,20
Lorazepam,"I don't know what I would do without my lorazepam, I ordered it because I was out of it but it was on a weekend and I didn't have it for three days because I couldn't get to the pharmacy without a vehicle. I was so anxious I could eat think we're sleep! I prayed that God would find a way for me to get my medication when I got my medication I felt like a new person again I could function but without it I could not. Thank God we have physicians and medication that can help us. I give Ativan a 10 out of 10",10,14
Lorazepam,"<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 Has gotten me through many sleepless nights and panic attacks. I only take it if I absolutely need to, to help me at night time when my anxiety is at its worse and only a dose of 0.5 mg. It almost always makes me sleepy and helps me sleep and normally I don't feel to groggy the next day.",0,46
Lorazepam,"<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 I've been on this medication since 2018 and it works wonders for my anxiety. The first time I took it was when I was having an anxiety attack in the mall when it was really crowded. I usually take 1mg along with drinking juice, water or even soda never grapejuice. The effects kick in between 45 min and 2 hours and I feel extremely calm, happy, silly and even loopy. I wish the effects lasted longer than 8 hrs though but I still love this drug regardless",0,29
Lorazepam,"When I needed it 1 mg made me more akin to a normal person with no anxiety induced freak outs. I could function in public.  For sleep, 2 mg started knocking me out but left me a little groggy in the morning. After I built a tolerance, even 3 mg wasnt knocking me out any more and I was groggy from drugs and lack of sleep. New Bipolar 2 DX and new pdoc refuses to prescibe Benzos for fear of abuse and addiction.   When it worked it worked great but high tolerance led to taking more and more and leaving me open for addiction and abuse.",7,9
Lorazepam,<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 Ativan does the job. But you do NOT want to go through the withdrawal. It's very bad. I have generalized anxiety and panic disorder to the point where I can't leave the house unless I really have to. And ativan makes it a lot easier to leave the house. The withdrawal makes your anxiety come back with vengeance. It's bad. For the short term it's great but long term you become addicted and physically dependent on it. And you build a tolerance so it doesn't help you as much as initially taking it. I love ativan and recommend it to anyone suffering from anxiety. Just make sure you wean off it or you will feel like a life becomes a nightmare.,0,37
Lorazepam,"I've been on lorazepam for over 20 years. 1mg twice a day as needed. Have to take one at night because my brain never stops. It was my saviour med. If someone says they have something that will stop your paralyzing panic attacks and non stop anxiety, what would you do? I jumped right on it. Now I can't find a med doctor who wants to prescribe it! They want to put me in rehab?? I've had two heart attacks from my panic attacks so no, I'm absolutely terrified to get off the med. I also have very high blood pressure. So what I'm seeing is  this could be the end of me  because lorazapam is the only thing giving me somewhat of a normal life and Dr won't prescribe it. I'm Agoraphobic, have such bad panic attacks that they wake me up. Sometimes twice a night. I also suffer from depression, PTSD, OCD. Looks like I'm doomed. Thx doctors",10,27
Lorazepam,"<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 Safe and effective medication as long as you do not become dependent on it.  PLEASE avoid getting hooked on this medication as it is a benzo and withdrawal from benzos can be deadly.   Has helped me manage severe panic attacks due to anxiety, depression and ocd.  I take 0.5 mg if I am having a severe panic attack and it immediately helps take the edge off.",0,33
Lorazepam,"I had a stroke, 9 actually. An artery filled with plaque broke loose after my unattended high blood pressure. Each of the pieces of plaque was considered a stoke. It change my personality almost completely. I have daily anxiety attacks and I started drinking which I never have before.  It seems that I dont care about anyone except me now. No empathy.  I have a husband of 44 year and hes sick and a disabled son. I tried therapy but he just kept bring up the past about how my parents treated me and I couldnt handled that. So I started leaving once a month. I have too much anxiety. The Dr put me on 2mg a day of Lorazepam and I can control it better plus Zoloft. Zoloft alone did nothing. But if I didnt have the Lorazepam to take daily, I dont know where Id be. I wish the DEA would stop being so strict on it when its given to those who really need it and long term. Nothing else has helped me.",10,23
Lorazepam,"Ativan is really good when youre having a Panic attack or you feel like one is about to come on, it works quick so within 20 minutes you should feel calm and back to your  normal  ways. The issue with it is that you start becoming dependent on it, meaning it works so well that you start convincing yourself you need to take it going into any situation and not using it for what its meant to be used for which is what I mentioned above. What eventually ends up happening is that when you are not on it you are anxiety and panic gets 100 times worse than when you previously started taking it. I literally became one anxiety machine, got dizzy, nauseous and felt sick all the time without it. Once I stopped taking  them everything went back to normal, this drug in my opinion is dangerous! Stay away from it unless youre TRULY having a panic attack.",7,15
Lorazepam,"lorazepam has saved my life of numerous occasions. When Im doing all the things I should be to look after myself yet I still become completely overwhelmed, past the point of no return- to the point where my brain is mostly all nasty and mostly thinks about suicide- then even half a tablet makes the world of difference. The anxiety literally melts away and Im able to start again and begin the looking after myself process again. I also like that I can use take it when I need and I dont have to take regular SSRI medications which all made things worse for me and whose side effects were unbearable. At low dosages I have no side effects with lorazepam at higher dosages I lose balance or trip over things easier and can me forgetful and very sleepy.",10,21
Lorazepam,"<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 I literally took one dose of 1.5 mg's of lorazepam after being prescribed the drug for panic attacks and anxiety. It worked for the panic attack, but since that 1st dose I haven't slept in 3 days. Reflecting on it now I would have rather just gone through the full on panic attack. This drug is no joke",0,15
Lorazepam,"I take Ativan and Lexapro. Lexapro works amazing for depression. And Ativan seemed to change my personality. Im actually more comfortable in my skin! People like the new me too. Imagine being able to be yourself, sleeping better (weird dreams though), and anxiety diminished.",0,16
Lorazepam,"Everyone let me completely honest. When I first started this medicine it was a life saver, until I realized my life was starting to surround whether I had the medicine or not.  When I didnt have it, I got very very sick. Throwing up, sweating, nausea, tremors all that. Basically withdrawing. So I did what I had to , to always have it.  I am weaning myself off with the help of my doctor. Your body gets dependent on this. Dont start it please. Its not worth it. And I have horrible anxiety but its still not worth being a slave to a drug. Its other things that help but not that! Please stay away!",4,23
Lorazepam,<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 This is by far the scariest experience I have EVER had with a drug. Ativan immediately took the anxiety away but the after effects were horrible. I took it intermittently for 2 weeks and then noticed when I didn't take it consistently my anxiety was 100 percent worse. I was crawling out of my skin and so irritable. I also had uncontrollable muscle shaking and memory problems. This drug is very dangerous for some people. I'll stick to cognitive behavioral therapy.,0,38
Lorazepam,"This medicine is such a life saver 0.5mg morning and 0.5mg  evening before bed added to an anti depressant cymbalta 90mg and Aripiprazole 5mg. My relative came out of a deep depression and anxiety after one day of trying lorazepam, after 7months of struggling with different kinds of anti deprepressants, Do not stop cymbalta lf its working for you you will regret the withdrawal effects are horrible and after a while the relapse is horrible. Lorazepam for anxiety is just perfect, definitely recommend but start at the, lowest dose esp if you want to add it to an antidepressant and same time every day. The side effect they complained  lack of energy after waking up  but that was just after 3 days of taking it",10,18
Lorazepam,"<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 I had been having extreme anxiety and panic attacks for 4 or 5 days and didnt feel like I could handle them on my own anymore. I went to the ER and they gave me Ativan to calm down. Im not sure what the dosage was but it was in pill form. At that point I had been crying non stop for 3 hours as I was very scared and my heart was beating very fast. Within half an hour or so I could feel the medication working as it took the edge off of my anxiety. When I went home I immediately fell asleep and stayed asleep. I also hadnt been sleeping well so that was a relief. It worked really well for me, but I only took it at the ER and havent taken it consecutively as a prescription. The only downside was I felt very groggy and foggy the next couple of days, but that could be attributed to exhaustion. Overall it really helped me a lot.",0,39
Lorazepam,<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 Ativan amplified anxiety so bad I could not stop vomiting.,0,14
Lorazepam,<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 I like Ativan better than valium but not xanax be careful on any benzodiazepines. They will mess with your brain up cause memory loss. I've been on them for 20 years. No way can I go off them now. I'm screwed. I tried twice and went insane. I kicked a 4 year opiate addiction with the help of suboxone and that was hard. Kicking benzos makes kicking opiates like candy. Trust me benzodiazepines  are dangerous. My Dr never warned me of the addiction until I switched drugs. About 5 years in. Isn't that nice? I live with them they keep me calm. I have very bad anxiety but knowing what I know now I would have took a shot of vodka a couple times a day. I'm not a drinker but it beats the side effects of benzos. Moderation is the key.,0,41
Lorazepam,"Lorazepam Doctor gave me this at the hospital to deal with anxiety. Got a prescription for 8 tablets. I took the first tablet the following night and that was the worst night of my life. I was dreaming while awake, afraid to sleep for fear I will die in my sleep, having to use the fan in the winter because I was hot. Took 3 more tablets at different times and same negative results.

Lorazepam,I have severe depression and until I see a head doctor so to speak I am taking Lorazepam for anxiety I loath Valium and Xanax ! I've been on too many anti depressants and they did not work ! My MD put me on Abilify however I haven't started them yet !

Lorazepam,"My psych doctor switched me from 3 mg. diazepam/day to 0.5-1 mg lorazepam/day to help with near constant anxiety issues that peak in social situations due to a very severe lifelong hearing loss that has been corrected as much as possible with aids.  I had been on the diazepam off and on for nearly 40 years for anxiety and Meniere's Disease and she had me switch because of lorazepam's shorter half life, important as I move into my late 60's.  This med has helped me significantly with my social anxiety and with my anxiety in general.  Although I realize I am on a pretty low dose (max of 1 mg daily..), I still try to take as little as needed to address my symptoms.  Often, I am able to get by with as little as .5 to .75 total for the day.  I believe this is important to do as I am also a recovering alcoholic with over 20 years sobriety.  So, I'm pretty careful..",8,27

Lorazepam,"<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 the doctor gave me Ativan for treating bad anxiety/panic attacks. I just take 1/2 of a 1mg pill when Im experiencing a panic attack. (The doctor was very reluctant to prescribe it as it is a benzo) but in my opinion it is 100% better than the long term stuff which just completely messed up my moods and made me depressed which I never was before.  I keep the Ativan with me and if I start to feel a bad attack coming on I have 1/2 a pill and am completely fine again within 15 mins. Its been a life saver for me as my panic attacks would sometimes last days and Id be throwing up, the whole deal. Ativan has really helped, Ive only had to use it twice in six months, but just knowing its there if I need it is great. The only side effect I get is drowsiness but usually I take it at night anyway so its good. I also get a lot of relief from cognitive behavioral therapy like tapping and meditating.",0,46

They ended up having to take me back to my house because they just couldn't deal with me.

Lorazepam,I am 64 years old and still work full time running my own cleaning business. I have been taking 1mg ativan for over 40 years. I have never asked another doctor for refills. I have never lost a prescription. I treat my anxiety and panic and insomnia with this medication and I don't have any problems until recent. My doctor who I have had all my life passed away and I was forced to find a new doctor. I started looking and was shocked to see they all wanted to put me on antidepressants and quit my ativan . Needless to say I was shocked after researching the side effects of the antidepressants. I do really well on my Ativan and persisted looking for a new doctor. Finally god gave me a new doctor who understood I just want to live my life as I have in the past. People be prepared for doctors to treat you like a drug addict and make you feel terrible about yourself. One doctor actually gave me pamphlets for a drug rehab center. Good luck to you all,10,51
Lorazepam,I'm reading all of these positive reviews but if I'm completely honest this is making it much worse. It makes me feel like I'm having more of an out of body experience. Like I can't grasp reality however I am completely able to carry on as if everything is just fine. It's just very uncomfortable.  I do not recommend this over xanax in any way. Not for me anyway.,1,16
Lorazepam,<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 Ive done research as I suffer from anxiety I had a doctor prescribe me Xanax and from all Ive read online they are almost identical to each other. I would rate Xanax much Lower than Ativan. Ativan truly cures anxiety and all I need is 1 pill for 3 days and I feel normal and functioning. Xanax makes you feel drunk and wake up with an anxious  hangover . Must be my genetic make up but I highly prefer Ativan just do not abuse it. You must respect this medication,0,46

I suffer from major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Ativan helps my anxiety immensely. Especially useful for full-blown panic attacks - within half an hour I feel normal again. At first it made me sleepy, but as my body got used to it, that side effect went away. There was a time when I was having debilitating anxiety on a daily basis, and my pdoc advised me that I could take up to 4 mg per day. Thankfully, I havent had the need to take that much. Overall, Ativan is a great medicine. I could go days without taking it with no adverse effects (I.e. withdrawal). This medicine works well for me. Good luck!!",0,62

Sometimes you just naturally need to fight through an anxiety episode.,0,31
Lorazepam,"<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 I was put on a low dose of Ativan by my PCP one week ago for an unusual and isolated anxiety attack. He gave me a month supply (2x a day) plus 20 mg of Celexa for depression.   Ativan makes me very very drowsy (definitely not anxious or depressed!) It's meant to have a calming effect on severely anxious individuals or help ease insomnia.  I've read Ativan is prescribed to calm patients before surgery. I may have had it before surgery, but right now I believe it's unnecessary and overkill.   I thought the Celexa was causing the fatigue!",0,4

Lorazepam,"<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 Ativan is an amazing drug to take for sleep and for anxiety however proceed with caution if you struggle with depression and are not on other meds for depression. I started taking Ativan for insomnia and for anxiety but it unmasked depression for me and put me in a real dark place and all I did was cry before I would finally go to sleep. I slept amazing but like I said, it made me feel more depressed. :( So for that reason I had to stop taking it. But it is the best for sleep, I always woke up feeling super refreshed if I took Ativan the night before and it didnt make me have any crazy dreams like some meds for sleep can do. Like I said, only side effects for me were worsening depression and sometimes upon wakening feeling confused. Other than that, I highly recommend Ativan ??",0,17
Lorazepam,I started taking lorazepam after I developed panic attacks and severe anxiety. I didn't realize it was suppose to be for short term use. 3 years later I want off this med so bad.

Lorazepam,"I had horrible anxiety for years and tried numerous drug treatments.  I wanted something I could take as needed which would give fast results.  Many of the other anxiety drugs I tried had negative side effects but Lorazepam had none (with me anyway).  It would immediately make me feel calm and helped me to sleep at night.  I was taking 2mg/day.  I stayed on it for over a year and feel like it was a life saver.   When my doctor retired, I decided to wean myself off of Lorazepam, mostly over concerns of these types of drugs being linked to dementia in later life.  I went through horrible withdrawals (very bad anxiety, insomnia, agitation, quick to anger, etc) that took over a month to stabilize.  I quit cold turkey which you're not suppose to do.  Now months later I still have bouts with anxiety but I'm trying to manage it without drugs.  I wish there was something safe and effective that I could use long term.",10,18

Lorazepam,"<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 Addiction, dependence, and abuse are all 3 very different things and carry different definitions and connotations.  I see many worried about addiction.  As with any of the many drugs that change a physiological function, our bodies can become up or down-regulated and normalize the presence of the drug. Any mammal reducing or discontinuing certain drugs, like Ativan, can experience dependence, characterized by physical and emotional distress at withdrawal. This is should NOT alone be considered ADDICTION. Addiction often involves dependence, but that's not all. If you discontinue Ativan and find yourself drinking uncharacteristically more, or pursuing other chemical ways to cope, you may have a valid addiction concern.  Phy./emo. dependence, is not the only criteria for AdXN. Dr's are generally accepting of this and should take no offence. Consult an expert, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol are the only common substances that can be dangerous if d/c'd suddenly.",0,14

After several sessions I was referred to a psychiatrist and diagnosed with severe depression with anxiety disorder. He put me on many different anti depressants and anti anxiety medications until finally the combination of Cymbalta and Ativan finally started working for me.

Finally gave in the other afternoon and I was my normal self that night and all next day. Then the following day I was back to being anxious. So disappointing because I had hoped something got jarred into place. I'll try cutting the day one in half and see if I can do that for a few days. I do like this drug.,0,33

I dont know why I have this reaction to Ativan since Xanax, Valium, and Klonopin work absolutely fine for me and dont cause this scary side effect. Im sticking to Klonopin. Theres much better anti-anxiety medications than Ativan.",1,8

Sometimes, I feel I need to take just a little more than 0.5 mg. I have been incredibly hesitant to take this drug more often, part of me wants to try it on a more daily basis, but we'll see. I should mention I took zoloft for the better part of 6 months, but it did not help with my anxiety issues. Plus, I don't want to rely on antidepressants for this issue if I could avoid.

I don't care what other people say about this medicine this medicine has been great for me - that's it,0,39
Lorazepam,Been on this medication for about a year now and I'm positive it works for me. I was diagnosed with MS and had a lot of anxiety and depression.  This drug helps me calm down and take a different approach to things.,8,20

Lorazepam,"<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 For immediate relief this drug is great. I take 0.5mg when I absolutely need it (2-3x every couple months.) but only reason I wouldn't give it a 9 or 10 because I did have a bad experience with this drug. I took it for 7 days straight 3x .5mg per day as prescribed by my doctor for generalized anxiety disorder. I abruptly stopped taking it because I didn't want to have to take it everyday and I ended up going thru a withdraw. I then got vertigo for a couple months, which was absolutely terrible. BUT I think it you use this drug responsibly and do NOT take it multiple days in a row it can definitely come in handy. I also have high blood pressure caused by anxiety, and usually get effective relief after about 30 minutes. Hang in there!",0,30
Lorazepam,"I am a 35 year old female with Bipolar Disorder Type 1 and generalised anxiety.  I've been taking lorezapam off and on for about seven years, only during panic attacks or particularly bad spells when my anxiety can't be managed by the coping techniques I've learned over the years through CBT, mindfulness meditation, etc, and my daily mental health medications (quetiapine, venlafaxine, and topiramate). When I do need to use it lorezapam is a godsend.  It works more quickly than diazepam, which I'd previously tried, which is what you want when you're in the midst of a panic attack or suffering badly with anxiety.  It's very effective without being too much and I haven't had any side effects, just slight sedation.",10,12

The medication made his heart race because of the lethal combination mixing with Welbutrin for his depression. He became manic, paranoid, and had extreme body tremors, insomnia, and many many trips to Emergency Room from side effects.  This company  knows it can cause suicide and writes it on the label.

Lorazepam,"I have had severe anxiety for a couple of years. My attacks get so bad, I feel I need to run as far away as I can. Taking Lorazepam 3mg a day has been a tremendous help. I have read comments about going off the medicine and the difficult withdrawls, but if something works in your personal lifestyle where nothing else has, why shouldn't you be able to stay on this medication as long as you need it? It's like high blood pressure. If you have it and can't get it under control, medications are key. No one starts telling you that you should stop the medication. For some, Lorazepam is a lifesaver. Maybe not for everyone, but for me, in my situation it is.",10,54

I know when my anxiety was a lot worse, it didn't bring me down to 0 anxiety but took the edge off. At one point in the past I was taking it pretty much daily but never became dependent on it (I only take the 0.5mg dose). I do feel kind of sleepy, but pleasantly so. In my experience the sublingual (under the tongue) type works a lot better than the normal swallowed pills.",0,45

The Xanax works really well for me, but I was seen in ER yesterday for heart palpitations, chest pain, muscle and body weakness, blood pressure elevated heart rate elevated I thought it was the end of my life,  The dr then said he would give me an injection of Ativan sent me home with some as well.....Last night was the first night I was able to sleep peacefully thanks to Ativan,,",0,20

I only took it when in the throws of panic during a time when I did not know how to cope. It has done absolute wonders for me. I take 0.5mg only a few times a year now just when my GAD gets to be too much or anxiety disrupts my sleep for more than a few days. It's wonderful in small doses, as needed, and combined with CBT.

I slept through the night and woke feeling calm and NORMAL for the whole next day AND the day after! I've taken 3 doses in the last 11 days, and took 1mg after a particularly stressful day with the same good results.

Lorazepam,They work very well,10,5
Lorazepam,<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 You would have to be crazy to take Ativan.  I took 1-2 mg 2x a day for 6 months and had withdrawal symptoms for almost 4 years after stopping over a 2 week period per my doctor. If you think your life is bad before taking Ativan just wait until you experience the withdrawal and after effects of this poison.  After 2 years still had vibrating hyper sensitive vision and hearing .  Burning in your nerves especially in your feet.  Forget sleep all you do is lie in bed awake for me almost 2 years dreaming while awake.  That part was the most torturous part of the med.

The car ride was calm.  I didn't sweat, no feelings of wanting to panic.  I was able to browse clothes and shoes without having to do my usual breathing exercises to keep myself relaxed.

Not nearly as effective as it used to be but still works.  I prefer to keep the dose low and use it with Buspar 7.5 twice daily and 75mg Effexor XR for my OCD and depression.  The Effexor seems to help my OCD and the Buspar/Ativan takes the edge off the Effexor.  I also use Ambien CR 12.5mg.,0,15

I came to to the ER in tears, unable to control my breathing, feeling suffocated, body tingling, nauseous, face numb, the whole 9 yards. After taking the Ativan, I was feeling completely back to normal within 15 minutes, I could not believe it!

Lorazepam,"15 years of trying different medications to help me cope with my anxiety disorders. Unfortunately for me as the drug addict I once was, has made it almost impossible to get prescribed lorazepam. Even though lorazepam is not a drug I've ever abused, it still is extremely difficult to obtain a prescription. I tell you that nothing is impossible. This medication alone, has saved my life. It's effects are strangely different than that of other benzodiazepines. My opinion, Just take RX exactly as prescribed by your Dr. and utilize coping skills such as DBT, to further your success in managing/coping with a crippling disorder such as anxiety. Lorazepam is highly effective, instant reduction in anxious thoughts/feelings/emotions, and is proven.",10,30

Highly recommend for infrequent fliers with anxiety",0,43
Lorazepam,<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 Have been taking this for situational anxiety for many years. It worked to some degree but I would always feel depressed afterwards which was awful. Last year I used it daily up to 1.5mg while I was changing my anti-depressant. This was a huge mistake. I soon reached the tolerance and began to get rebound anxiety which started up every morning. I've been off of it for 10 weeks now and still suffering. This is really hard to come off of. My advise is don't take this more than once a week and that may be too much.

Drug companies in this and most other countries are motivated by one thing ONLY. Greed/MONEY and getting more. If someone can be helped as a side effect along the way, it makes great press but it sure isn't essential.

I personally do not like the long term effects of the drug and wish it was more of a 30 min to 3 hour effect. But this is great. My first choice would be Xanax, this a great second. There is some short term memory blanks, and more difficultly in concentration at times, also a slight sleepy feeling. I do not feel any addiction aspects to this drug. I can take it, or leave it. I noticed when I do have anxiety, and take it, this helps the episode resolve sooner. If I have anxiety and don't take it, I get through it longer, and may have other problems associated with the stress on my body.

Lorazepam,"I've been taking Lorazapam for many years but usually not more than once a week for really bad anxiety. The problem is it's addictive and you want and need to take more to get the relief you were getting before. So the more you take, the higher the tolerance and you need to keep going up and taking it more often. Another problem is the half life for Lorazapam is between 4 and 8 hours. This means you should really take it 3 times per day. If you don't you start getting reflex anxiety. After the dosage wears out your anxiety goes up. This was what I experienced and I went through the worst time in my 17 years. 8 weeks ago I stopped taking Lorazapam and switched to Diazapam to taper off. I suggest staying off this drug.",2,18

It almost feels like I hover over it but it's still underlying.,3,6
Lorazepam,I have anxiety and sleeping problems. I like Xanax a little better I think.  But Ativan still helps. Not from me because I haven't tried it yet but I heard if you like Xanax you have to double up on the Ativan from Xanax from 1mg to 2 and it would feel the same. That Ativan is weaker but has a longer shelf life. Regardless I would recommend this med out if you have sleeping problems or anxiety. There's usually a hard time for me to find a medium for me. I'm either too happy or to sad. Ativan n other benzo's give me that.,9,5
Lorazepam,This drug does help with anxiety. But this drugs attack on your mind and your soul when you suddenly quit this med is hell!!! I advise everyone to stay away from benzos. They will rob you of your life and your sanity. I have recently stumble across a amino acid that works better than a .5mg of lorazepam. It has no side effects and is actually good for you!!! Its called L theanine. This is a amazing natural supplement for anxiety and phobias. Its 100% safe and it works better for me than lorazepam. I take 400 mg a day. 200mg in the morning and 200mg with a 3mg melatonin at night for restful sleep. I stopped benzos after being on them for 2 years for horrible panic and anxiety 5 days ago.

After reading about Lorazapam and the problems with tolerance, rebound anxiety, looping and withdrawal, I realized my problem was not the antidepressants but Lorazapam.

It worked great, but I didn't like the drowsy side effect in the morning. But, I will tell you, it is a life saver to quell off an attack that's in full gear or one that you feel coming on. As I write this, I just woke up in the middle of an attack and took 1 mg and am starting to come down after an hour. I only take them as needed now, so I don't build up a tolerance to the medication. I hope this was helpful to a few of you that suffer out there too.",10,35
Lorazepam,"<b>Ativan (lorazepam):</b>			 An excellent medication, out of all meds I tried none were as effective for managing my PTSD symptoms. Completely prevented flashbacks and nightmares and anxiety at night and allowed me to fall asleep very calmly. However I can't give it a 10 because I gained tolerance to the doses incredibly quickly, meaning I had to keep raising the dose to get the same effect, which is dangerous because it is a drug you can become physically addicted to. I would highly recommend this med to those seeking a short term fix while they are becoming stable on another long term med, but would not recommend it as a long term fix due to tolerance and addiction possibilities.",0,44

I've learned what the on-set of an attack looks like, and by taking this medicine within thirty minutes I am calm, collected and have completely avoided what might have been a mental breakdown.

Within 10 minutes of taking one 0.5g sublingual tab it's like all the anxiety in me went out the window.

Personally, if I took more than 1mg, I experienced dizziness, double vision, the exact side effects I have with Ambien, which I use for a completely different reason. However, it does calm you down. If I had to be specific, it slows down your thoughts. It doesn't get rid of them and put you in some euphoric state, but it helps significantly.

What I will say to all of those who consider taking any benzodiazepines for their anxiety or panic attacks is that there is no benzo I would rather choose than Ativan. It provides not only relief from anxiety and panic attacks, but generally quells anxiety prone symptoms such as nausea, irritability etc., most effectively.

Lorazepam,"If you're using this drug for anxiety make sure you read up on it before you use it for more then an occasional anxiety-fix.  Even at the minimal dosage, using this stuff daily for even a week will cause problems.  Namely - it CAUSES anxiety.  From what I've read this is a dependence that develops - either (or both) physical or mental. After only a few times you get accustomed to it fixing your situation.  Your body adjusts for the GABA boost, and then crashes - resulting in anxiety.  Very bad loop to get in.  Warning signs: you're counting the # hours the med will still be working (about 6 total), you're watching the clock for when you might be able to take another pill, you always carry a pill in your pocket, etc. Those are bad signs.",8,42

I can go some weeks/months without ever taking it and then If I have a bad issue with the family or a panic attack from a flare it works fabulous.  The most I've had to take it was 10 days in a row. I've had a prescription since 2004 and it's 2016 I get 30 1.mg a month.  I don't use them all but I do  get a refill every couple months just to have some on hand.,0,56

Because of my addiction history, I am very careful with it and never take it more than prescribed. It is enough to make me feel evened out during the day without making me loopy, euphoric or sleepy.

Lorazepam,"Lorazepam has saved me from anxiety many times. I personally believe this medicine is best used when needed rather than every day. When I take 0.5mg, I feel relaxed and my mind is clear, all my worries seem minuscule. It seems to slow down my cycle of constant worry. It does take about 45 minutes to really kick in, and peaks about 2 hours after taking it. The effects last 4-5 hours. If I take 1mg, the amount it lasts stays roughly the same, it's just a stronger feeling and does make me very tired. Taking it when needed is a life saver.

It's got worse over the years, and I turned to medication when everything else I tried failed. It helps calm me down to the point where I am not scared all the time. It sometimes takes a little while to work, but it's worth it. The only side effects I get are the spacey feeling in my head, and my vision is a little messed up. It's a great trade-off, instead of suffering with that anxiety literally all day and night.  This medicine is great.",9,40

Lorazepam,I've been receiving relief from the intense anxiety l used to feel that started 20 yrs ago by taking 0.5 mg of Lorazepam. Usually only at night until my seasonal work kicks into gear and then occasionally once during the day. But it has been a life saver. The triggering divorce from 20 yrs ago left me depressed and the side effects left me spacey and numb. The doctor who identified the real issue as anxiety and not depression l feel saved my life. I guess there are those who get hooked and/or abuse this drug...but it has been safe for me w/ very few side effects. I'm most grateful that it doesn't make me groggy the next day.

Ativan is a great safety net when needed, no side effects except some small cloudiness. Use with caution and be knowledgeable.

I feel relaxed in about a half hour and can function again. I don't take it every day or every week but I can't imagine being addicted to something if it makes you feel normal.

It is fast acting and wears off quickly.  It allows me to relax into a situation and become comfortable with the new environment.  I only take it a few times a month, so there is no danger of becoming addicted.  Just knowing I have one pill with me helps me face situations better.  It's a 'crutch', I know.

Clonazepam,"I am 27 years old and my psychiatrist prescribed my Clonazepam 2 years ago when my anxiety and sleep deprivation got out of control. I was prescribed 0.5mg 1-2x daily as needed, but usually taking 1/2-1 (0.25-0.5mg) tablet does the trick. Never had an addiction issue, never had any issues stopping or taking long breaks off of this medication. I dont abuse it and truly only take the bare minimum as needed.  I had tolerance issues with lorazepam and Xanax, where I felt like even after a week, I had to continuously increase my dose, but never with Clonazepam. 0.25-0.5mg is perfect when I do take it. Like with any medication, you just have to be careful and know the risks. Im grateful that my psychiatrist gave me something that helps. Without this medication I would not be able to function socially, go to work or sleep on my bad days.",10,33
Clonazepam,"This is a miracle drug for me.  I was on it for 7 years and slowly worked my way off of it 9 weeks ago.  Taking 3 months to get off of it.  I had the past 9 week be the most awful; it took me till last week to figure out it was anxiety.  I could eat, sleep or concentrate.  Within 8 hours of my doctor writing me the script. I was back to my normal self!",10,17
Clonazepam,I get annoyed when I google Klooipin and all I see is scare tactic's of how its so dangerous.  It's has been a life saver for me for the last 5 years.  I never abused it or ever even got the slightest remote high from it.  I take 2MG in the morning and 2 MG after 5PM. It literally saved my career as the level of anxiety that come over me was horrible and the only drug that stop my heart from pounding out of my chest is klonopin.,10,41
Clonazepam,"Ive been on Klonopin or Paxam or Revotril which is the Australian brands, for about a year and a half, 2mg a day for severe social anxiety. I tried countless SSRIs and Valium and Ativan werent strong enough. My Psych tried  to put me on Seroquel or Zyprexa to get me off but I declined. This medication works wonders for me. I can see my friends, go out to bars/ pubs and generally do my normal daily tasks like working and driving. The enormous downfall is that they are incredibly addictive and the potential for abuse is massive, plus the withdrawals dont get me started can make you crazy and can be life threatening. You just need to have self control and take it EXACTLY as your doctor tells you to. Otherwise youre in big trouble. This is a beast of a Benzo (not anywhere near as bad as Xanax) and not to be played with. All the best to those who are trying it!",9,17
Clonazepam,"What should I ask or how should I ask my doctor that the clonazepam that I have been taking for a few years now is not working and I am just getting worse, I have very bad Anxiety and Manic Depression. It's isn't getting better but worse?",7,11
Clonazepam,I have been having constant panic attacks with my reduced dose of Klonopin to 1/2 pill twice a day of the 0.5mg.  I have seen a few different dr.s and I m going back to someone who knows me instead of a stranger that has called my ex husband and left me out in the cold. I have used 2 pills this month to get ahold of my panic and will probably be a couple of days without meds .I don't know what to do since SSRI s don't agree with me,7,5
Clonazepam,"clonazepam is very effective for anxiety, however dependence  and tolerance can develop quickly to some of the effects. Essential to take it in accordance with the medical information provided regarding dosage, side effects and the maximum recommended length of time period can be taken. Longer use can expose you to unexpected mental health  issues. Make sure you always mention to your doctor if you take this medication even if using just intermittently.",6,7
Clonazepam,"I dont normally write these out, but Ill make an exception here.  Let me start off by saying I only gave it 8 stars because, yes, your body does become addicted to it. I ran out. Once. Tried this  mindfulness  junk for a week before it hit me like a truck. Next thing I know I go from ok to in the ER getting injections of Ativan for my BP being 180/140 and Heart rate off the charts. After the Ativan I was perfect in 10 minutes with a BP of 117/80 and 80 pulse. THAT being said, theres no denying the drug works. And it works pretty darn good. I had a heart attack at 30 years old. After that experience I developed GAD and it just gotten worse over time. Unfortunately, Klonopin is the only drug that keeps this under control. The fact my BP and heart rate are directly affected by my anxiety condition makes it a double edged sword. Ive been on it 2 years now at .5mg twice daily.  Yeah, youll feel a little woozy until your body adjusts, but it will go away.",8,20
Clonazepam,"This is my second review for Clonazepam. As I stated before, Ive only used it (for the past 8 years) on an  as needed  basis with favorable results. I do, however believe that this medication is not for everyone! My mother was prescribed this after my dad passed away suddenly and she had a not so favorable experience-brain fog, auditory hallucinations which obviously increased her anxiety. She had similar experiences when she tried Xanax.   Its a shame that Clonozepam has caused some individuals nightmarish results!! Clearly people react differently with this either taking it and/or weaning off of it. As others reviewers have stated, some have little or no problems with weaning and others are thrown into a tail spin that put them in the hospital. You really dont know how your body will respond to it. My heart goes out to the people who are still struggling with the aftermath of this medication!",8,11
Clonazepam,"This has been a life saver for me. I went down a spiral of depression and self destructive behaviour and was very resistant to see a doctor which made things worse. Also, I was scared of the fame that follows this substance. Once I decided to see a doctor and started the recommended dose - 0.5mg three times a day - life changed in a very acute way: intrusive thoughts were diminished, concentration went up and productivity went back to what it was before depression set in. It's been 4 years on it at the same dosage. This and the anti-depressant saved my life, once I was on the verge of suicide.  Nowadays I allow myself to skip dosages on a few days without any signs of malaise.  I can't say my experience is a textbook example of what it does, but in my personal experience I may say it was fundamental to avoid something worse.  In my country the recommended treatment limit is about 12 weeks; I'm well past that and, as I mentioned, I'm able to take drug holidays without negative effects.",9,23
Clonazepam,"Have been on .5 , .25 and now  .17 once daily.  Began med 20 months ago.  Had almost tapered off after one year all way down to .125, had a traumatic accident and panic attacks began.  Back up to .5 for 4 months.   This third time on this med.  First was 9 years!  Taper took 3 months first time,  no withdrawal.  Second time was 6 years later for only 1 month, no problem getting off.  This time has been harder.  But going slow and taking control of my taper is do-able.  Im down to .17 for 5 days now.  Had one poor sleep on 4th night, 5th night was better and days are ok.  I take gabapentin 600 mgs daily (two doses at 300 mgs each, am one and pm one).  It calms me and has made this much easier.  The reason I started tapering with gaba is I was having breakthrough panic attacks,  did not  want to increase dose.  Instead of going up, I went down.  Go slow!!!!!  Stick with it.  Ask about gabapentin to help.  This med stopped panic, but I will never choose it again.",6,5
Clonazepam,"Wish there were negative numbers to rate clonazepam. HORRIBLE stuff. Have been having anxiety and panic attacks over real situations (not just imagined). Took it once and felt like all the life had drained out of the world, not to mention staggering across the room. Cut dosage for second pill in half and felt nothing. Next morning I woke up and felt the worst depression and brain fog I have experienced in my whole life. PLUS extreme anxiety over feeling this way! It CREATES anxiety, plus depression, brain fog and lack of coordination. I'd rather have a normal panic attack and anxiety. This stuff is HORRIFIC. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. (To top it all off, people get addicted to it and can't come off it? What kind of bad joke is this stuff? Who paid off the FDA to approve it?!!)",1,15
Clonazepam,"Tried other medicines but  clonazepam works the best, I take it as needed 0.5mg along with clonidine 0.2mg",10,12
Clonazepam,"Ive been on clonazepam since I was 27 yrs old and I am now 51. I have complex PTSD, diagnosed at age 21. Age 27 I was put on medication. First I was on Zoloft, it gave me worse anxiety and I developed anorexia. Then Paxil I was really anxious and it scared me. I ended up in the hospital for 11 days,( I now know I had serotonin syndrome). I went to the hospital again and the emergency department told me to get off these medications and I was put on klonopin and when they ran out, I couldnt sleep and was extremely anxious and fearful.  I was prescribed 0.5 milligrams twice a day. My Dr now wont prescribe anymore so I had to go off. Ive been weaning off since September 2018. It has been hard but overall easy (staying mentally focused is key). Im now on .25 mg hoping to be off by 2020. This medication saved my life and Helped me get stronger emotionally and psychologically. I honestly  wouldnt recommend any medication for anyone who has PTSD ..therapy is best.",10,20
Clonazepam,"My clonazepam brand is complete garbage. I doubt that theres a half milligram in a 2 mg pill. They dont work, and actually cause more anxiety put you into withdrawal, cause massive nausea and headaches and more side effects then I can mention. Making this product in India with poor quality, them shredding documents and you guys selling batches that dont meet quality standards so you dont lose profits at the cost of peoples health is disgusting. Even though the FDA is useless from your big money lobbyists I am filing a complaint along with others that had to experience this horrendous fake medication. Everyone that works for this company belong in prison.",0,24
Clonazepam,"Ive been on Klonopin for almost 25 years. Ive been mostly .5 mg 3x per day but I usually only take it twice. Klonopin is an excellent medicine for panic and anxiety, which is what I use it for. It takes the edge off. Keep in mind though most medicines  have a trade off. For me, Klonopin has been a miracle drug but it does take the edge off everything. Creativity went way down, attention span, sex drive. Memory. Everything. Went off it cold turkey many years ago and it tore me up with withdrawal symptoms.",8,17
Clonazepam,"I've been taking 1mg Clonazepam 3x a day for many years, for MS and anxiety. One week ago I switch to the generic blue pill with the C 1 on it by Accord. It literally has little potency. I immediately made a complaint. Folks, if you have a complaint, nothing will be done unless you call your local FDA office!",1,11
Clonazepam,Been on 1mg up to 3 times a day as needed for anxiety for the last 3 years. changed my life greatly. Before taking this I would not make eye contact with people was always worried about little things and had ruminating and intrusive thoughts. I was also initially prescribed this for sleep but it does not really make me tired even at the max dose. but great for anxiety and panic disorders,10,33
Clonazepam,"PROBLEM is that the new TEVA without the scoreline has been released and DOES NOT work the same as the old version WITH the scoreline its just addicting. it does nothing else. it has caused me to be very sick... teva please, bring back the old formula.",1,14
Clonazepam,OMG. I was prescribed Klonopin 2mgs three times a day for almost 15 YEARS. I wanted to get off in 2019 so asked Dr to begin tapering down. In 9/2019 I was @ 1 milligram a day - went cold turkey. HOLY MOLY!!  Welcome to the worst time in my life for almost an entire month! In bed entire time - Shaking/Sweating/Convulsing/Etc... Thought I would surely be the end of me one particular day when blood pressure went to the stratosphere and pulse was 180 ALL DAY! Think about your heart beating almost 200 beats per minute from 4AM to 11PM. Was going to call 911 but was so delirious couldn't! This is hands down NOT a drug to take for a long period of time YET not one Dr ever said a word to me!,1,22
Clonazepam,I took clonazepam one an hour ago so hoping it'll knock me out. I can't even sleep now. So I guess they're not for me.,4,6
Clonazepam,"This medication has worked WONDERS for me. I have extremely bad anxiety and had no relief for months on end. Was convinced I was going crazy and in a frantic state of mind constantly. Not sleeping well, not eating well, panicking, overwhelming and intrusive thoughts at a high. As soon as I got over my fear of taking medication and actually swallowed my first dose I found the next morning to feel a huge sense of relief from the anxiety. I was not as paranoid and socially anxious, which Ive never experienced even on good days. The benefits of this medication are incredible.    I will say that becoming addicted to this seems to be a very reasonable statement. I dont know how long Ill be on it but my tolerance has quickly risen and Im taking more and more for the same relief. Itll be a month on it now but this is the ONLY thing that has worked for me. For desperate situations like my own this medication is a lifesaver.",10,34
Clonazepam,"I frequently experiences those patterns of thought and emotion that psychiatrists call social anxiety, generalized anxiety and depression. Got prescribed clonazepam a few years ago when my anxiety was through the roof. I take 1/2 to 1 tablet of the lowest dose on days when I'm so anxious I feel like vomiting or when I'm trapped in a social situation I can't escape and have a sobbing breakdown that I just can't get under control. In most cases, within a half-hour or so of taking the pill my nausea eases off and/or I can finally stop crying and stay dry-eyed for several hours straight. The only side effect I've noticed is moderate physical tiredness that lasts several hours.",5,8
Clonazepam,After a rough spot as we all have in life I saw a psychiatrist. He prescribed me 2mgs clonazepam daily. It was one in the morning and two at night. I cant take at work as I work in surgery. So I took them at night and feel the effects mildly all the next day. Ive always had insomnia and it has helped with both anxiety and sleep but now I am trapped and it is so difficult to get off.  My doctor never even as much mentioned this   Good luck to all of you when and if you decide to get off this stuff because you will always need more as tolerance is constantly an issue.  This drug is great short term not long term.  Doctors are mostly clueless as to what exactly a person suffers getting off these and other meds.,4,17
Clonazepam,"I seem to be one of the few people that does not get any benefit from clonazepam. I have treatment resistant OCD, depression, anxiety, and panic disorder. I thought I'd try this med to deal with the constant anxiety OCD causes me. I figured I'd take it just once or twice a week to avoid dependence. I tried 0.5mg which did virtually nothing, so the next time I tried 1mg which maybe helped the tiniest bit for a few hours, but it made me exhausted and I fell asleep sitting up. Also with both doses, after those first few hours, my OCD got WORSE for several days, which made my depression worse too. This is the 9th med I've failed, not sure what's next. Ps. All benzos contain lactose, keep in mind if you are intolerant.",2,3
Clonazepam,"Once my doctor prescribed this medication clonazepam  with .25 mg and I felt relieved. Then I thought of increasing to get its full benefits (.25 to .50 then .50 to 1mg then 1mg x2 and finally 1mg x3).  The more I increased the more I felt relaxed, focused and smart. So, I was on 3mg per day. Finally, when I ended up with 3mg I started having the side effects like sleepiness (more like sedation), forgetfulness, decreased sexual urge, confusion, increased depression etc. I tried a lot to quit from it and my anxiety comeback more severely and had a fainting sensation. I had to be admitted in hospital to withdraw fully from it. Now, I am fully withdrawn from it but my anxiety in has increased than usual with disorganised thinking and speaking, slight forgetfulness. This is an occasional or short term drug which is given during the initial period of any drugs. Using this for long term period creates high dependency for this drug and you will no longer be the same person with it!",0,12
Clonazepam,"I have suffered with anxiety, depression, and panic disorder my whole life. I was prescribed this clonazepam med a few years ago and am now taking about 3mg a day and its a lifesaver. Im a night shift nurse for a few more months so it not only helps my anxiety but also my circadian rhythm problems. Scared to go off if I become pregnant though (Im a 25 year old woman and heard withdrawals are pretty bad)",10,11
Clonazepam,"I have been taking Clonazepam 0.5mg for about 10 years now. When my initial anxiety emerged my doctor put me on Paxil. With Paxil I was not myself and the side effects were horrible. Just this month I had to take mental health leave from work due to being overwhelmed, never had to do this before. Doctor tried putting me on Cymbalta and the side effects trying to get I. This drug were horrific, like a nightmare. I dont know why doctors dont listen. Clonazepam work 100% for me. They talk about addictive ness of Clonazepam, but they never talk about the horrific side effects of anti depressants going on and coming off those meds. I use to have panic attacks and anxiety even when on anti depressants, but once I was prescribed Clonazepam have not had a panic attack in 8 years.",10,41
Clonazepam,"Doctors have made me try every SNRI, SSRI out there. My symptoms worsen. I have been hospitalized with serotonin syndrome taking these medications. A doctor did not look over my current drugs and prescribed me amitriptyline for foot neuropathy. Within two weeks I was in the ER. They gave me more clonazepam with ativan  and fixed me right up. Much of my anxiety stems from being disabled by two back surgeries and spinal stenosis. This medicine saved my life. I was given valium before clonazapam.",10,21
Clonazepam,"I have suffered for most of my life with bad anxiety and panic attacks. I believe it is the cause of my high blood pressure. I have been on this for almost two years. I am prescribed to take 1 mg 3 times a day but only take 1 and half a day.... I am going to slowly try and get off of these. I dont notice any side effects.  I do believe I am addicted to them.  I take them daily.  I want to start taking only when I need them. But after suffering for so many years with chronic anxiety and panic attacks. I take everyday.  I never want to feel anxiety or have another panic attack again on my life.  But I dont want to be on a pill everyday either. This pill has saved my life, but its time to cut back and start feeling things I dont want to feel again.  Im praying I wont feel the anxiety anymore? But I know I will. I hate anxiety and I feel so bad for everyone that suffers from it!",7,25
Clonazepam,I have been taking Klonopin for approximately 7 years now but only on an  as needed  basis. I only take 1 (0.5mg) when I feel like I truly need it and sometimes I just cut in half. This drug is great for that purpose alone. I would never want to take it daily and end up with dependency. This is just my opinion and personal experience with it. I always keep it on hand for peace of mind and my Dr (knowing I dont abuse it) still prescribes it for me. My heart goes out to people who have been taking it daily for years and then try to wean off only to find themselves in a nightmare of withdrawals!!,8,20
Clonazepam,"It is hands down the best! I wish I could take it everyday but its very addicting, 3 weeks is all that is  could take mentally to be hooked. It makes me feel happy, focused, no depression, think better do everything better!!",10,25
Clonazepam,"I was on a low dose of Ativan for anxiety,  panic attacks and PTSD symptoms, for over a decade. After so many years it didn't work as well. Instead of raising the dosage my pdoc reccomended I give clonazepam a try. I was hesitant,  I dislike change. But I'm glad I gave in and tried it, it stays in my system much much longer than the Ativan and I don't even need a high dosage. I take 0.5 x 2 daily as needed. It will be a year next month and in this past year I've had no panic attack's at all. Amazing!  The side effects I've had were sleepiness and weight loss.  I went from 160lbs to 130lbs in the first 6 months.  Without changing anything. I do still get a little tired on it, but nothing too bad.  If your thinking of trying an anxiety med, I recommend giving this one a try.",10,20
Clonazepam,I've been  taking clonazepam for the last 8 years and it is very effective for anxiety. I was unable to walk  and go places and feeling scary to stand and walk due to anxiety. I am taking this medicine and enjoying my work and life.,9,25
Clonazepam,"Ok so heres the thing. This medication was recommended to me after I told my doctor that I no longer wanted to use Xanax given its newly acquired bad reputation. Im on 0.5 (an immensely small dose) and its helped tremendously. Lost multiple friends and family members this year and my stress levels have been through the roof. On such a small dose both my mother (a licensed practitioner) and my doctor are not worried about it forming some sort of full blown addiction. As needed is the way to be. Dont take them  once a day as needed  take them as YOU need them not every day. Dont worry about the side effects. Dont worry about the stigma. Just heal. And if this happens to be an aid in healing for the time being well, then so be it",10,77
Clonazepam,"I have a chronic illness as well as Fibromyalgia and generalized anxiety. I've had insomnia for decades, and Clonazepam, 1.5 mg taken nightly helps me tremendously.

Clonazepam,"From the time I was little I had  restless leg syndrome (RLS). I never took anything for it. I would go outside in the winter &amp; stand in the freezing snow in my bare feet, &amp; believe it or not it worked for a lil while. In 1997 my Dad passed, &amp; I totally lost it. My doctor put me on clonazepam for  anxiety  and depression. It worked great. After some time of being on it, I noticed my RLS was gone. Amazing! Now they want me to slowly get off of it. My restless leg syndrome is back, and I dont sleep well at all. My  anxiety is getting worse again, &amp; the withdrawal is horrible. I would stay on it for the rest of my life if they would let me, but because I have to take pain killers I cant be on both. They want me to take medical Marijuana instead. I hate the thought of that. An I really hate the thought of going through withdrawal. Im done for either way I go. Up the creek without a paddle.",10,12
Clonazepam,I take clonazepam .05 mg and it helps a lot for me. I have a mild essential tremor. I take the pill only as needed. It stops my tremors and calms me down. It also helps on my anxiety attack. Its not addictive for me but I bring it in my pouch every day just in case of emergency.,10,17
Clonazepam,I have been taking clonazepam 1mg for years. Mine was either yellow or white. Now it was changed to a blue color with c 1 on back. Seems to me the blue ones don't take effect as fast. seems like it takes about an hour while the other ones only took 15 to 25 minutes. Don't know why,10,12
Clonazepam,"I have been on Klonopin for almost 3 years and it is the worst drug you could ever be on, in my experience. It is highly addictive and you become very dependent on it. It caused my depression to become worse that I have been hospitalized several times for it. And coming off the drug is terrible if you suddenly stop taking it. I get insomnia, worsening of depression, confusion, and muscular pain. You have to slowly taper off of it. I do NOT recommend this drug to anyone with anxiety or depression.",1,14
Clonazepam,"I've taken 1mg daily for anxiety and panic attacks for over 20 years. I've never experienced any side effects from Clonazepam. I've tried to stop, and have been successful, but the anxiety and panic attacks return. I live a much better quality of life with it, and I accept that.",9,51

Then doctor prescribed me 0.5mg clonazepam once daily. After using 2 years continuously I observe that it decreases my memory power and it is very very addicting medicine. Then I follow Ashton method to reduce it. 10 months ago I started to reduce it. Few days ago I completely off clonazepam. Withdrawal effect was not very strong because of slowly reduction and I was also convert the clonazepam to Daily exercise, eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.

Clonazepam,"I've been taking 0.5 mg of Clonazepam for about a week, it has helped tremendously with panic attacks, I still feel anxiety but its less bad as it once was. I take 0.5 mg in the morning when I wake up to prevent a panic attack and 0.5mg at night to help me sleep. The only thing is it makes me so weak, shaky, I have no appetite and it makes me way too drowsy to drive and I really need to fix that because I have a road test for my license to do that I won't be able to take my Clonazepam to help my panic attack because I can't drive. Seeing a psychiatrist soon I hope everything works out. The drowsiness is killer. My whole body wants to sleep but my mind is trying to keep pushing forward.",5,5
Clonazepam,"I started having serious anxiety attacks daily that included upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and an elevated heart rate. After doing some blood work which came back normal, my doctor has prescribed 0.5mg of clonazapam as well as an anti-depressant, Zoloft. The Clonazepam is intended to be taken daily to manage the attacks until the anti-depressant starts to take effect in a few weeks. The clonazapem has been managing the attacks and I dont need a lot. I am surprised though how many people out there have been taking this medication long term - some for decades. Everything Ive read, and what my doctor confirmed, is that benzos are not intended to be used long term. A lot of people who use benzos long term are addicted without realizing it, and there are a lot of doctors out there that are pill-pushers. Thankfully mine is not and I am hopeful I will be able to manage my anxiety the healthiest way possible, and using medications as they are intended to be used.",9,11

With that medicine I'm back feeling happy no anxiety or panic attacks. I can drive like I use to and talk to everyone with no anxiety . I hope this helps anyone who is going through what I went through.",1,12
Clonazepam,Eventually youll have to titrate your dose up because the drug becomes less and less effective over long durations and you develop tolerance to it,8,6
Clonazepam,"This medication saved my life. I take it once a week, or whenever I'm having an unbearable anxiety attack, where I'm nauseous and shaking. It isn't meant to be used every day. It's habit-forming and you'll develop a tolerance, so I only take it when I really, really need it. Having it is just a comfort. It's like a safety net. Knowing that if the panic attack comes, I can stop the horrible effects and the pacing and the vomiting and shaking. A downside is that you'll develop a tolerance if you use it more than once or twice a week, so you do have to be extremely careful. It stops my panic attacks and it's saved my life. It's kept me from killing myself because I thought I'd never be able to escape the anxiety. I'd only recommend it if you've tried SSRIs and they haven't helped, and your anxiety is unbearably severe.",9,16
Clonazepam,So I used to take Xanax 1mg 3 times a day it helped but made me tired now my doc put me on 1mg 3 times a day of klonopin. Day 3 I feel nothing  I tried 1.5 and felt very calm and relaxed.,0,6

It shouldn't be taken regularly and longer than a couple months at MOST. I strongly hold the belief it should only be taken alongside therapeutic treatment. I've been on Clonazepam for 2 years. I'm down to .75 now. But the withdrawals are absolutely the worst thing I could describe a human being could experience. The last 2 years have been a weird personality blur, which I haven't been aware of until recently. Overall for mental health conditions, I'd say seek therapy; not a pill to make you forget about your worries. I would have rather been physically dependent to heroin any day.",1,10
Clonazepam,"I have been using Clonazepam for 5 months, 0.25 mg before bed.  It is a really good medicine it helps you sleep better, relaxes your brain.  It gives  me full 8-9 hours of sleep and I wake up pretty refreshed no side effects that I can feel up to now.  I have started to taper off the medicine.  I am taking half of 0.25 mg which is pretty low dose and I guess and it still works for me.  Just be cautious with this medicine its addictive so try to taper it slowly",10,14
Clonazepam,"I have been a small dose of Clonazepam for 30 years. This drug has saved my life. I lived in the house for years; was hospitalized multiple times. Along, with a SSRI I have been able to leave my house for short periods of time. I feel if used correctly and not abusing such a drug it should not be withdrawn.",10,18
Clonazepam,This medication has kept me alive when all Ive wanted to do is let myself go from the extreme amount of panic attacks I was having a day. I take .5mg in the morning and .5mg in the evening along with my SNRI. I would rate this medication a 10 if I wasnt so fatigued on it all of the time. It does exactly what its supposed to do and for right now it would be unbearable for me to get through a day without it. Thank goodness for this medication.,8,18
Clonazepam,"I was originally prescribed this for serious panic attacks associated with PTSD and found it to be quite effective (0.5-1.0mg doses) Cant say I've ever noticed it having any effect on sleep but for anxiety and panic disorders it works a charm when other medications, like pregabalin, didn't quite cut it.",8,13
Clonazepam,"I have PTSD, Agoraphobia and Social Anxiety. My Psychiatrist put me on this medication  clonazepam along with an antidepressant. Since I have started using it I have been able to go out and socialise along with a large reduction in flashbacks.  It is a great medication for when things get out of hand, I am only on a low dose (0.5mg twice a day) but it is a lot stronger and more helpful than other benzos I have trialled.",10,14
Clonazepam,I have been on 1 mcg of Clonazepam at night time to treat nocturnal panic attacks.  It works like a charm.  I sleep and I never have an attack when I take it.  =),10,8
Clonazepam,Have taken Clonazapam for several years.. Prescribed for cervical dystonia. Positive: helped control head tremor Negative: memory impairment. I would rather have the tremor! I was not informed that there would be changes in memory and mood. Read the pharmaceutical information before  taking prescriptions!! Talk to the pharmacist!! I did.  Too late !,1,4
Clonazepam,Taking clonazepam for anxiety. More social anxiety than anything else. Have been on this for a decade and started having issues with short term memory while in school again and decided to get off it. Yes the withdrawal is brutal but the medication works for awhile. Noticed it wasn't working like it did at the start when I switched to another drug for my anxiety.,8,11
Clonazepam,"I suffer from major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD. My anxiety became extremely out of control, racing thoughts, paranoid a lot and over thinking. I have taken Clonazepam in the past, and learned that  it is a medicine you take about an hour before you go to bed. I would never take this during the day. I normally stay fatigued anyway throughout the day so if it causes that I wouldn't really know. I really do appreciate how this medicine works, how it gave me the best sleep I have had in a long time, and calmed the craziness in my head, I feel like I am getting my life back.",10,21
Clonazepam,"Been taking Clonazepam 0.5 mg twice a day as needed for anxiety, some days I only take one. Im also taking paroxetine 20mg once daily. I love the medication for my social anxiety and I sleep so much better. But I wish I didnt sleep so much. The other day I slept for 22 hours. Hopefully my body will get used to the medication soon and I wont feel so tired. But other than sleeping a lot I love the medication. It calms me down and Im less stressed.",9,17
Clonazepam,"I am 34 years old and have been on clonazepam 0.5 twice daily since I was 19. I have never had any side effects and I can truthfully say that it has been an absolute lifesaver for me! I have anxiety disorders, depression and PTSD. I highly recommend it if you have anxiety/panic attacks and it does help me relax and sleep. I've also never had to to increase my dose in all these years while taking them.",10,53
Clonazepam,I went to a.psychiatrist because of sleepless nights and he told me that I was having an anxiety and panic attacks. He prescribed me Xanax 250mcg 2x a day and escitalopram 5mg in between. He also prescribed .25mg of clonazepam (rivotril) before going to.bed but still I can't get enough sleep and the anxiety gets worse.,0,7
Clonazepam,This medicine helps me with my daily activities sometimes my anxiety is so bad I cant eat or drink my throat feels closed up and my mind is constantly racing with thoughts. I feel as if Im out of my body and mind I tried getting off of it cold turkey.  My withdrawals were horrible I had to retake the medication. Hopefully one day Ill be back to normal without it but for now it REALLY HELPS!! Im HAPPY AGAIN,9,17
Clonazepam,"I had severe attacks of anxiety followed by vertigo for over a year that were not treated in time due to the wrong diagnosis of doctors. To shorten the story after a while, I go to a doctor who recognizes the problem and gives me clonazepam, for which I have been around for almost a year. I am 90 percent better after ten months of therapy and even forget about a couple of days to take the drug. My anxiety caused dizziness and I get this unpleasant feeling and  I get a little scared, but after taking the medicine it quickly passes.",10,17
Clonazepam,"I just suffered from two weeks of hell, bad continuous unrelenting panic attacks, sudden spike of simple partial seizures, I was starting to feel hopeless exhausted and ready to give up on life. Words cant describe what I was going through. Desperately went to a medicentre and broke down in front of the doctor about not being able to see my GP for another week and I couldnt take it anymore and he instantly prescribed the Clonazepam. Within 1 hour I felt normal again and I almost cried tears of joy, and the normal feeling keeps getting better and better. I hope I dont become dependant though",10,27
Clonazepam,"My doctor has tried me on many different drugs from gabapenten, seroquil, Xanax, Valium, propranolol, klonadine..nothing works for me except Klonopin. Because of all the studies coming out and many people having adverse reactions to the drug; I am now reduced to taking Advil at 800mg each night and klonadine. I never had withdrawals, gaps in memory, walking around in a zombie state..when I was taking this medicine regularly I even skipped doses. Anyways, Im not the doctor..and am still be treated like a lab rat for trial and error medications. Sucks",10,12
Clonazepam,"I've taken clonazepam for over twenty years with no side effects,  I tried to stop a few times, but the anxiety and mood swings caused me to start again. I just hate the feeling of being so reliant upon it.",8,40
Clonazepam,I have been taking 0.5 for about 10 years. It helps me sleep much better where before I would wake up with a mind that wouldn't stop. I was on Ambien and that was too much. Happy with my Drs. recommendation as my dosage is pretty low.,0,13
Clonazepam,"I suffer from GAD which manifests itself by causing PAINFUL knots in my upper back muscles at its worse. I tried aspirin, ibuprofen, and prescription muscle relaxers. Nothing eased the pain except 1.5-2 mg of Clonazepam. After years of taking Clonazepam skipping a day or two here and there, I was curious to see if I would experience withdrawal. Thus, recently I refrained from taking any for 5 days. Thankfully, nothing triggered my anxiety during those 5 days and I also take Lexapro daily (still prone to the trigger point knots in my back even on lexapro if my anxiety is triggered). I didnt experience any withdrawal symptoms. I guess I am one of the lucky ones after reading about the horrors of Clonazepam withdrawals.",10,17
Clonazepam,"Long story short,  I was a police officer for 16yrs. I had the extreme misfortune of having to use deadly force on a horribly confused, and drug enraged 19 yr old kid. Every time I closed my eyes in an effort to sleep,  I would re-live the incident as vividly as it was in real life, seeing the young man's face and the confusion in his eyes. I reclused from my wife and children, as well as everyone else. I believed I was too strong to need counselling or medication to help me.  After finally realizing I was on the verge of destroying those that I love beyond what words can express, I went to my family Dr, who told me he had been waiting for me to come for help.  I was put on Lexapro daily,  and 0.5 Clonazepam as needed. It saved me from going insane, I truly believe.  It doesn't change the horror of having to do what I did,  but does calm my mind so I can get some rest and be a husband and daddy to my angel of a wife and two precious  boys..",8,56
Clonazepam,"I have been on 2mg clonazepam for more than 5 years. It has done wonders for my anxiety and panic attacks. When I informed the Dr. I was concerned about addiction he advised me I am DEPENDANT on it, not ADDICTED. Addiction is the misuse of a drug he said, big difference! I am allowed 2mg up to 3 times a day but very rarely take more than 2. It has literally changed my life.",9,47
Clonazepam,"The drug is great, calms you, lets you sleep with anxiety and major family illnesses.  However do not use on a daily basis after 30 days.  I was not informed by my general practitioners (2) to be exact how addictive this med is.  Now I am going thru tapering (a nice word for withdrawal) after 8 years.  It is worst feeling in the world.  Now trying to get into Med Detox.  Be very careful with Benzos.  In fact only take when you are dying.  It will calm your death anxiety.",1,19
Clonazepam,"If youre  considering taking clonazepam, this should be a temporary prescription only! I was prescribed this for severe anxiety. What no one will tell you is that this medication is severely addictive to your system . No matter how strong or how healthy you are, you can die from trying to stop the medicine cold turkey. I almost died twice. Whatever anxiety you are feeling now, it will be amplified by 100xs when it comes to trying to stop the medication; it anchors into your body.  I was told that  Clonazepam  is harder to get off of  than Heroin. Just consider that when your doctor tries to prescribe it to you for more than a few weeks. Even then, it should be taken as needed and it should be taken in small doses.  And just to be clear, I almost died twice because I was trying to stop taking the medication not because I took too much of it. Hope this helps at least one persons life",1,27
Clonazepam,Wonderful medication I  have been on 0.5 mg for many years now and sometimes take another 0.5 at  night to help me relax and sleep. I do not drink so that's not an issue. I have a sharp memory so no problems there. I have a stressful life and this really helps me to calm and focus myself. I am less shy and can express myself better at work when I take 0.5 which I do everyday. It has helped me so much with my shyness and anxious self I only wish I had sought out help earlier in my life.  I am in my late 50's and have taken this for over 10 years. Frankly my cognition and memory are better than others my age. Recommend if constant worry and shyness are holding you back. Just keep dosage steady and don't increase if you don't need to. I do not have an addictive personality so for me this medication is great!,10,45
Clonazepam,"I was stable on diazepam and was prescribed it off and on for 30 years. I had tried all the SRIs and Selective SRI's with only worsening conditions. I tried them all, some more than once. Finally it dawned on my new GP that I has serotonin syndrome with the SRIs, After 4 months of trying other things, nothing worked. My new pain doctor tried me on clonazepam. The first dose worked wonders. My constantly struggling with anxiety all day was gone. No more waking up with immediate panic attacks either. I am a different man. There is no high with a drug if your body needs it. Same with opioids. Benzos and opioids can safely be used together if you cannot tolerate SRIs due to serotonin syndrome.",10,27
Clonazepam,This product helps reduce anxiety symptoms. Within 45 minutes or less. It can make you tired and glassy eyed. So be careful taking this medicine. I really like this medicine because I can go into public places again without anxiety.,9,18
Clonazepam,Klonopin helps with panic and anxiety you get before going out in public. It also made me calm without making me feel drugged up or high which allowed me to partake in daily life activities.,8,15
Clonazepam,"Was on clonazepam for 10 years after trying other antidepressants with no relief, had reactions to the antidepressants. Had to find a new Dr due to mine retiring. Have been off the clonazepam for 4 mths and have tried 6 different medications. None have worked for my anxiety and panic attacks. They have continued to get worse than ever before! I have to be on opioids due to many medical conditions and have thyroid problems and autoimmune disorders. Which only make the anxiety worse. Followed all the rules and never abused the clonazepam lowered my dose myself with no problem! Trying to find a new Dr who will prescribe clonazepam is impossible. Just because you have to take opioids too! You are put in the category of an abuser. Which I am not. I just know what work's for me and what does not. Really tired of these Drs not treating there patients because they are more afraid of the black box laws.",10,39
Clonazepam,Severe anxiety in 8 yr old. Was prescribed .5mg of clonazepam to be taken at .25 2X per day. Plan was to follow a week of this with 5mg of prozac and increase to 10mg. Clonazepam was to provide immediate relief. After two days my son become beligerant and angry. We stopped the drug and moved immediately to prozac which takes up to 4 weeks to provide relief. Doctor advised us to try with the CZP again over a long weekend. Results were no relief for anxiety and a renewal of beligerance including hitting and kicking parents and severe anger.,1,2
Clonazepam,"I have been taking clonazepam for over 10 years. I take a 1 mg tablet 3 times a day. It helps me tremendously! I used to have bad panic attacks and I would get so stressed out sometimes that I actually would cut myself to calm down. I started out on a lower dosage and eventually ended up where I am now. At first it caused drowsiness, but not now. As long as I take the correct dosage 3 times per day, I am perfect! If I forget a dose, it doesn't take long before I notice it and my family does too. I have never tried getting off of the clonazepam since I started it. If I tried, I would probably get help from my doctor and taper very slowly. It works and helps me, so I see no need in stopping taking it.",10,29
Clonazepam,I take clonazepam for depression along with bupropion and it helped me a lot with my mood. I stopped having crisis and crying like I did before when I took only bupropion without clonazepam.,0,13
Clonazepam,My dr put me on this 0.5mg  klonipin  when required in 2010. I at first felt confused so I decided to cut pill in half taking 0.25mg as needed.  My new dr  tried to change it to buspar  because of regulations.  It did not work for  my anxiety I need to take it feel relief within an hr in situations.  I  was on Ativan in the 80's for a short time. I had to convince my new dr  to try it give me 10 pills and see how I do     that was 2 wks ago and I have had to take 1/4 or 1/2 pill and settle down in 30-40 min I am 65 use to be a registered nurse  wish I had this years ago,10,10
Clonazepam,"This is excellent every day use for anxiety. My life has been so much better the past 3 years that  I've been taking clonazepam. Quality of life, relationships, work, social. I plan to take them the rest of my life. Able to enjoy life and be productive. Helps most when I am manic with bi polar",10,21
Clonazepam,I get really bad anxiety to a point where my chest get so tight and I can hardly breath and start getting paranoid. Clonazepam has worked so great !!,10,23
Clonazepam,"The first time I took Clonazepam was in 2006 &amp; it was for an appointment. I had eaten before I took it &amp; it didn't work. Because of this I didn't want to take again (I didn't realize that eating may prevent it from working). In 2015 I was prescribed it again at the ER (because of anxiety). I decided to fill the prescription &amp; I took 0.5 mg. Since I had not eaten for several hours it worked (after 2 hours) &amp; I didn't feel anxious. I like it more than Ativan, since it has been more effective in reducing my anxiety for various medical appointments &amp; even social situations -  I once lost my keys &amp; had to have a security guard help me find them; this security guard is rude &amp; if I had not taken the pills I would have left the mall &amp; just paid to have them all replaced instead of asking for this security guard's help. The only thing I don't like about Clonazepam is it causes me to gain weight and worsens my acne, even though I don't eat or drink anything different when I take it.",7,11
Clonazepam,"This medicine changed my life, seriously. I have anxiety/panic attacks and I take 0.25mg when Im feeling anxious and cannot function, and Ive been on this dose for 2 years. It works within 30 min and lasts the rest of the day so I can do whatever I need to do. I dont take it every day, sometimes Ill take it for a week straight if I have something stressful going on and then Ill go weeks without taking it at all. I havent had any withdrawal symptoms so I think its a great medicine if you have anxiety. Im not sure I wouldnt recommend taking this daily because I could definitely see it becoming less effective!",10,22
Clonazepam,"I have been taking this medication for like 4 years now or close 0.5 mg once a day. I took it in the past and stopped when I got pregnant no withdrawals. I tried to taper off recently and I had bad racing thoughts with anxiety and panic attacks so  I got back on them. Im going to let my psychiatrist tell me when to wean off and do whats best for me to wean off one day, until then Im taking them as needed if or when I do have a panic or anxiety attack.",10,11
Clonazepam,"Started taking 0.5 milligram of clonazepam up to three times per day due to my PTSD disorder. Never had to take more than one pill per day so doctor refilled my prescription advising only one tablet per day. Works great for me but beneficial effects wane if you take it everyday. It is best to wait until you actually feel a panic attack coming on and then take it, not if you just assume a certain situation will cause anxiety before hand. No drug is perfect but it keeps me balanced enough to at least think and react rationally in day to day activities. I have been on this drug for three months and also take Lexapro 20 mg every night for about five years with good results.",10,11
Clonazepam,"I'm very new with this drug, It was prescribed to me by my physician. I'm really needing to know will I be able to function@work? Or is it a drug that needs to be taken@home?",0,2
Clonazepam,"Was given clonazepam 0.5mg three times a day for my anxiety, at first it did help but after two months anxiety came back worse, so doc upped it too 1mg three times a day. It did get rid of the anxiety but all I wanted too do was sleep. So doc tried to find the right dose but in the end it made me worse than I was before I started. After 3 months jumped off it and I actually feel better off it than when I was taking it. What works for some doesn't work for others",4,7
Clonazepam,"Worked for a short time. Effective dosage increased rapidly, efficacy decreases at a similar rate. After 2 months side effects became debilitating. Withdrawal symptoms (ongoing) include emotional instability, cognitive and memory impairment.",1,7
Clonazepam,It just works. Nothing else Ive tried has been effective.,9,26
Clonazepam,"This benzo has helped me get my life back. I've been on it twice in my life, so I know what the withdrawals feel like. I slowly tapered off of them when I found out I was pregnant and it was difficult, but not a horror story. Now that my son nurses only once a day, I am able to take 0.5mg of Klonopin at night. Within the first day of taking it, I noticed a difference. My anxiety is almost not there. I can relax and breathe. I take this in combination with Wellbutrin XL 150mg and it's the perfect combination for me.",9,15
Clonazepam,"I have been using Clonazepan or Klonopin 10 mg for some time. During Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, it was being distributed for a while. Then they have changed it to accudor, it goes among others. The problem is that I was on it about 2 weeks before I found that it was stronger than Clonazepan, then I started to have problems urinating and it caused varicocele in the testicles, among other side effects. Well, I chose to leave it stinging, since the psychiatrist  has a big wait before  I see them  until the end of June, which is the appointment. I ask there will be a medication that is similar in terms of ingredients and the least side effects in what, together with my psychiatrist, I can lower the dose to end the treatment. Thank you!!!",10,7
Clonazepam,"Pharmacy always carried Mylan or Tevia,  which always worked very well.. Now they are carrying Accord brand, manufactured in China. The quality of the Accord pill seems inferior.

Clonazepam,Okay for like the last year I've had some kind of psychosis and I started getting full of fear and anxiety. I got to the point where I couldn't leave my house and if I did I had to wear purple rain boots with green mittens not because I wanted to because I was afraid I might catch a disease and step in a mud puddle anxiety was taking over my life I finally went to a doctor and he put me on this Klonopin which I guess is okay I haven't had any nightmares except for one night I dreamed I was with Ben Affleck and then he killed me with a buck knife and then buried me in a shoebox.  I'm too afraid and I get too anxious to try to call the doctor because then they put you on hold and then I start getting overwhelmed when all the Bryan Adams music starts playing on phone and then I just can't handle it anymore so yesterday I bought a new puppy I named it Joe because I was told that it would help me with anxiety but to be honest this dog has done nothing but drive me nuts.,7,10
Clonazepam,"I take either   0.25 or 0.5 Mgs when I feel anxious, usually the .25 and in 30 minutes or so it kicks in and I get less anxious but start to feel normal again and care free. I don't feel like a zombie or anything like that, but I notice if I take a full .5 MG of in having a panic attack it doesn't work right away, at least 30 minutes to notice its actually working but It does work. That's the only thing where is doesn't work super fast but it does help. I had 30 pills last me 7 months do I don't take it everyday, not sure how I would deal with withdrawal symptoms because I take half of what the prescribed is by cutting it in half most the time. When I'm very anxious I take a full one. Sooo with that said in not sure how  effects of withdrawals are because I never had any but the medicine does work",9,13
Clonazepam,I was struck by lightning 4 years ago and finally saw a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with PTSD on top of the untreated bipolar and anxiety disorders that I already have. She prescribed clonazepam for anxiety which Ive taken in the past with no problems at all. (Also meds for bipolar and PTSD) The anxiety from the lightning strike has altered my life completely. Im obsessed with monitoring the weather and will not leave the house if I know a storm is coming. Im constantly reliving the strike and I live in an area where it storms regularly. This whole experience has been completely debilitating as I constantly live in a state of fear. I really want my life back so I hope this helps!,10,10
Clonazepam,It works pretty good for anxiety but not panic attacks and it helps me sleep,7,6
Clonazepam,"Was on Xanax and then Klonopin for 10 years.  Then I ran into a doctor who refused to prescribe it anymore and cut me off pretty much cold turkey. It's been the worst year of my life. Have been experiencing a lot of health issues that I do believe are due to anxiety now. I've had heart problems, major depression, severe anxiety disorder. My new doctor today said she could try a week's worth to see how I felt and if I felt like it was working I could go to a psychiatrist and get on a plan. I've only taken one but I'm already more relaxed, my heart rate is down my blood pressure is down and I can actually think. Plan to keep it as an as-needed drug but with only a half a milligram I feel normal tonight. I'm almost 60 and I really don't care if I have to take it the rest of my life. I just want to feel normal",10,38
Clonazepam,"I think this is the only cure that works for me I take 0.25mg to 0.5mg a day and I have no Somatic pain , like head pressure, tingling sensation in head, shooting pain in face , headaches , heart palpitations . I tried natural ways like (acupunture, omega 3 ,vitamin B and D ) that everything okay but just for some part of the time . Klonopin is making you be yourself again , I wanted to be off benzos , but ibuprofen and other pain killer don't affect me like klonopin . Best regards for this cure . If I need to take it for rest of life I'm okay with it",10,15

Clonazepam,"I have been taking Klonopin for 20 years. I had a complete nervous breakdown in 1997. This medication is the best ever for myself. I take 4mg a day for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and actually function great, I can work full-time and concentrate without my mind racing. I have NO problem being on this the rest of my life. I at least have a life now.",10,52
Clonazepam,"I've been on and off this medication about 3 times.  It has been a lifesaver with helping me with my sleep anxiety which was so bad at times I would go 4+ days with zero sleep.  It became pure torture and was affecting every aspect of my life.  If possible I would recommend getting a referral to a Psychiatrist before getting on this medication.  They have a better understanding of Psychological disorders and will be better able to help you and less likely to shy away from medications that could be life changing for you.   As for getting off the medication, I've done it 3 times now with a very slow tapper (took 1-2 months) and didn't have any withdrawal symptoms.  Currently weening without a slow tapper and I am paying for it.  I was taking 1mg and tapered to .5mg for a week then stopped.  I am having headaches, feel shaky and exhausted, heightened anxiety on day 1.. Hoping this will pass within another week if not may go back on .25mg for a couple weeks then half of that...",8,10
Clonazepam,"Clonazepam is very safe and effective for anxiety, derealization, and even (in my case) depression. It is easy to come off of, should you wish, by tapering slowly (finishing with a liquid taper). I have tried life for 30 years without clonazepam and for about 3 years with clonazepam. There is no comparison. Clonazepam seems to provide what my brain is unable to produce in adequate quantities. Please don't be afraid of this medicine. It does not make a person high, it is safe , and can significantly improve the quality of life for many people.",10,51
Clonazepam,"I'd been to four Dr's before the problem of Anxiety was properly diagnosis was made and I was put on 1mg 2x a day Klonopin and it changed my whole life for the better.  I had no idea I had anxiety problems. I was getting sick every evening , getting hot flashes and shakes? I went to the ER and Cardiologist and family dr. I was having hard painful heart palpitations 20/30 times a day. Now I have 0/ to 1 a day!!! I feel like doing things again! The only drawback I see is constipation and some short term memory loss. A welcome trade off for how much better I feel!!",9,20
Clonazepam,"Klonopin has been a life saver for me.  I suffered horrible anxiety for years before being treated and have been using the drug for 10 years.  I'm 42 now.  I use it as needed so sometimes I can go weeks without taking any, sometimes take a couple a day for a week.  I've never felt any withdrawal or cravings.  My only very small complaint is that I feel not quite as sharp mentally.  I am a chemist so I need my A game while at work.   Other than that this drug has changed my life for the better.",10,19
Clonazepam,"I've been on either Klonopin or xanax for around 20 years. When I try to stop them it's terrifying. I've gone as long as 2 months without and the withdrawal is even worse after 6 months then is is during the first 2 weeks. I can't take off work for a year to get off of these. I can't call off of work and say, of sorry I'm hooked on my anxiety medication and I can't come in. I got myself down to 0.5 twice a day and that keeps my functioning. But I can't function without them. I don't know if my anxiety is really that bad or it's the withdrawal.

They are better to take during the day cuz it doesn't make you sleepy, then I'll take maybe 2 mg before bed. It doesn't knock you out it just helps you sleep through the night and helps you go to sleep some cuz your mind's not racing. Well they stopped working after the 6 years so now I'm on Xanax 0.5 need to go up to 1 mg.  They work much better as far as anxiety I guess it helps some but basically I need to rest well at night when I switch to Xanax didn't have any withdrawals from Klonopin actually I stopped the Klonopin (cuz I lost my insurance) for probably two years before I started the Xanax and didn't have any withdrawals",0,8
Clonazepam,"My Klonipin is the oral disintegrating type. It dissolves quickly, under my tongue, and begins to work immediately. The instant action of the dissolving tablets is far greater, for me, than tablets that take time to work. A panic attack needs immediate action. Quite often Im driving the car when panic occurs. The instant relief has saved me from car accidents, Im sure. Just FYI...",10,16
Clonazepam,I have been taking clonozepam for roughly 3 years.  I have suffered from extreme anxiety since late teens.  I did not seek help until I was 39.  Prozac worked great for me but after 14 years lost effectiveness.  Have tried many drugs but discovered clonozepam. Works great for me.  I have learned to space them out due to reduced effectiveness.  Great at reducing anxiety.  !!,9,12
Clonazepam,"The temporary relief is not worth the crippling dependency. The withdrawal from this drug literally ruins people. Beware, too, benzo rage; I've never experienced a more terrifying emotional state, I felt like I completely lost myself and became cruel and ridiculously self-righteous. Meanwhile, this class of drug turned a kind and funny roommate into a two-faced thief and liar. There is a better way than benzos, be patient and be willing to work on yourself. This stuff ruins people.",1,8
Clonazepam,"I've taken clonazepam 1.5 mg a day with 1,000 mg Divalproex,and Adderall IR 20 mg for over 4 months. I have pretty bad ADHD and Anxiety/Social anxiety disorder. I've taken other benzos(Alprazolam,Lorazepam, Flurazepam) but these new drugs are absolutely the best in my opinion for controlling anxiety in any situation. It worked very well for me and continues to, but if you don't prefer sedation and muscle relaxation as side effects then you should go for a drug such a buspirone. But thats my experience.",9,6
Clonazepam,"I have been on Klonopin (Clonazapam) for 9 years and have never felt the need to increase my dose of 0.5mg in the am., and 1.0 mg in the pm.  I have PTSD, and no longer have panic attacks or the General Anxiety associated with the PTSD.  I might have to take it for the rest of my life, but without it my quality of life was unbearable.  I don't want to go back to the panicky shaking and heart palpitations and fatigue I felt after an episode.  Truly, my triggers don't even bother me that much due to this medication.  It's been my saving grace.",10,27
Clonazepam,Life saver.  Gets way too much of a bad rap by professionals who don't know squat about mental health. Make sure to use sparingly and you will not get addicted For high pressure situations at work or other emergency situations it makes me a normal person again.   This Rx has saved my life and my job. (Go to counselling too),10,14
Clonazepam,"I've dealt anxiety since I was a child but never sought help until it became very serious and my job and relationships were being affected. I was prescribed clonazepam and instructed to only take it when necessary. It has worked wonderfully for me and for once in a long time, I actually felt genuinely calm and relaxed, and my perspectives towards things that would bother me on a normal day changed completely (I was able to rationalise things better and get over problems quickly). The first hour or so after taking clonazepam is torture though as I would usually feel very drowsy and dazed. After that, as long as I eat properly, the drowsiness goes away and the pill will work wonders.",8,12
Clonazepam,"I have suffered from extreme social and general anxiety for most of my life, but didn't seek help until I was around 20. I was prescribed many SSRIs but none of them worked. Clonazepam has been the only thing that has ever helped relieve my anxiety. Its a shame that many doctors won't prescribe it because it can be habit forming, yet they'll gladly give out SSRIs that can cause manic behavior or suicidal thoughts. This medication saved me from my anxiety.",10,27
Clonazepam,"Been on clonazepam for a while. It is not as effective for me as lorazepam since most of my anxiety is due to severe, treatment resistant OCD however it's still effective in reducing debilitating anxiety. It has a longer half life than lorazepam and xanax but it's slower to take affect. My doctor combines this with hydroxyzine for panic attacks and it works quite well. I recommend this benzodiazepine over other since xanax has an extremely high chance of dependency, and over lorazepam because its just recently been discovered that lorazepam can cause dementia.",8,6
Clonazepam,This does not work for me.  Must be a placebo.  Did not alleviate symptoms at all.,1,3
Clonazepam,"My GP prescribed Klonopin 0.5 for severe social anxiety and tremors. I've been taking it for a week, and my anxiety is 90% gone. The only downside is that it takes 1-2 hours to kick in, but it lasts a while after it starts working. Great drug for anxiety and tremors! Highly recommended!",9,8
Clonazepam,"I was prescribed this medication to help with mild tinnitus.  After 3 months, I was having severe memory issues and thinking problems, so the doctor tapered me off.  After a couple of days, I started experiencing painful muscle spasms and a feeling of chemical burns all over my skin.  The doctor said this is common after coming off of klonopin and that it would stop in a couple of days.  It took over 3 months for these issues to stop, and no amount of pain medication would even touch the sensation of chemical burns on my skin.  Additionally, my tinnitus is now much worse than it ever was before klonopin - instead of the steady mild hum, it now sounds like air horns are being blasted in my ears.  Patients beware!",0,9
Clonazepam,"I suffer from health anxiety. Every new mole, lump, twinge... my mind would sink me into fear and a state of depression. Its not always. Most days I can cope with the irrational thoughts and sort it out in my mind but then there are some days where its too much. I have found that taking half of my 0.5mg tab in the morning and then the other half in the evening has made me the most level headed and normal feeling Ive felt in a long time. Doesnt leave me groggy just has me normal! So awesome to just be chill. Finally! Ive also noticed that if you are female hormones when they shift and change right before menstraution have always brought out my anxiety the worst! Good luck.",10,11

Clonazepam,"At 19 I have been on Buspar, Prozac and Ativan; none of which worked. I can honestly say Clonazepam is the only medication that has ever worked for my severe GAD, SAD and panic attacks. There is always a risk of addiction with benzodiazepines, but if thats the tradeoff to be a functional adult then so be it. I would recommend this only after less habit forming treatments have been ventured.",10,21
Clonazepam,I had facial nervous twitch and anxiety and clonazepam was a blessing in the past working as with  the public it was very embarrassing. I can drive with no problems and relaxed me enough to accomplish more also if I talk too fast it slows me down to a normal pace.  Sometimes I have insomnia and taking 2 tablet before going to bed did not work. My Doctor said take 1 tablet an hour before going to bed then take a second one after that hour it made a total difference.,10,11
Clonazepam,"Clonazepam has been a wonderful medication for generalized anxiety, OCD, and PTSD in my case.  It helps round me out and keeps me feeling stable emotionally.  The best part about this medication is that it lasts way longer than other benzodiazepines without the I need a Xanax now! feeling when it wears off.  It helps prevent anxiety in the first place so as not to need an immediate relief medication.  It doesn't make me feel sluggish or depressed.  Best anxiety drug I've taken yet!",10,25
Clonazepam,"I am a survivior of Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI'S).  I was misdiagnosis bi-polar.

Each individual would need to participate at their own discretion.  The point to my comment is for me...clonazepam has been since 2008 now it is 2017 a workable solution with no side effects or health risks or addiction issues.  2017, I have been arbitrarily taken off of  clonazepam by a 'physicians assistant' in the mental health field. We are not treating for depression.  This is not logical.",8,10
Clonazepam,"A few things to know: this medication will change your life. Even taking it once will make you realize that those sad, dark, anxious thoughts in your head is ONLY anxiety. I promise you are going to be okay. There are many people on here searching for meds who suffer from this debilitating anxiety that a lot of others (without anxiety) cannot understand.  Klonopin gives you that extra push you need to come to this realization and gets you through dark moments. Another thing: it is not as addictive as Xanax, which is extremely important when deciding which benzo is best for you. Best of luck.",10,69

Clonazepam,This drug in fact takes me from a 10 of horrible anxiety to about a 3. It has done wonders. It makes me feel like me again when I take it. I can think clearer and more positively. I wish they had an extended release. The only down fall is the only last maybe 4 to 5 hrs which is great to have that break but if it could carry on longer we wouldn't have to take more. Mind you I only take 1 mg a day. I try to be mindful of the addictiveness. I can't even say I'm addicted at all it just helps me be me and not sitting with that dreaded feeling all day in my chest and mind. I also have panic disorder I can't say it helps panic attacks but possibly gives u more courage to do things because I feel so good. And not good as in I feel high. U feel urself.,9,24
Clonazepam,"It was a good drug short term on 3mg 3xper day for 8 months, but then after stopping was put on xanax 2mg 3x a day, extreme withdrawal, I still can't recover my doctor got in trouble so I get .25 xanax 3 times a day and I use street for rest.

Clonazepam,"I suffered from debilitating generalized anxiety since high school. During university (25 years ago), it really spiked and the doctor I saw suggested rivotril/clonozapem on a longer term regular basis. For many years I took .5mg three times a day without incident. The anxiety never again got out of control...and I never felt need to increase. About 6 years ago, I decided to start cutting back very slowly. Eventually, over a long period, I actually tapered it back to .25mg once in the morning. This worked for two years until my marriage ended recently. I added another .25mg in the evening. My life has not been great, but IMO clonozapem has been a saviour. The GAD I had/have is not bearable. And other approaches alone do not work.",8,32
Clonazepam,"I had debilitating anxiety, panic attacks, sometimes so bad I was constantly dizzy, out of it and feeling like a completely different person. The pain in my chest would subside after taking this and I would feel better. I'm so thankful my Dr prescribed this to me, and I only take it if I really need it so when I get really bad panic attacks or increased anxiety. Different ones work better for different people, but I will never go on SSRI's again, they made my anxiety 1000 times worse, panic attacks from morning until night, no sleep, couldn't eat. My quality of life was so bad I felt as though ending it would be better. So, I'm happy I have a Dr who listens and cares about my mental state and wants to improve my life.",10,26
Clonazepam,I do suffer from Anxiety which elevates my hypertension. I take losartan to control my hypertension when I am not stressed but when the stress kicks in I take the clonzapam. After that my BP 150/95 recedes back to 130/82. I would like to take it every day and probably should but I don't want to become dependent on it. When I stay on it for a few days I see 117/72. It does wonders for my hypertension.,0,7
Clonazepam,"I'm currently on 2 mg TID (3 times a day). I was a 2 on a scale of 1-10 before I found Klonopin. It has helped me get up to a 7. I also take Paxil. Find a good psychiatrist or doctor who understand that people with anxiety need anti-anxiety medication (benzodiazepines). If you take as prescribed, you will see way more positive than negative.",10,27
Clonazepam,"Honestly, how well this works depends on the generic you get, and whether it works well for you. In my case, I took off two points for the Sandoz generic.  Seriously, Sandoz generic Clonazepam sucks!! But Teva, which some people hate, is so strong that I actually have to divide my dose between morning and evening, or I won't be able to get up. LOL. So, rule of thumb, be VERY careful when switching generics of this drug, because you may get your butt kicked like I did.",8,21
Clonazepam,"I have had chronic anxiety since I was a child that worsened over time. Klonipin gave me back my life. There were times that I could not even get a breath from the time I woke up until the time I went to bed. This obviously turned into panic attacks. I tried SSRI's and SNRI's that are supposedly safer however, they created more anxiety and they are not at all safer. Seratonin can build up and cause a sudden death. So as long as you do not abuse this medication and see a licensed MD it is safe and effective.  I would like to add that I recently found out that I have an adrenal condition that causes anxiety and being treated for that has reduced many of my symptoms so make sure you have a full work up,many endocrine problems are the origin.",10,19
Clonazepam,Excellent medicine if taken appropriately. Find a Dr who understands anxiety disorders and isn't just an antidepressant pusher. That's the biggest challenge. Once you have a doctor who prescribes what you need you'll be great. I take 2 mgs bid (twice a day) and I'm a different person.,10,25
Clonazepam,"My PCP prescribed this after long term use of Paroxetine was not helping all of the time. I get panic attacks often. Vomiting, pacing, crying, and hyperventilating. Ugly stuff. She prescribed Clonazepam 0.5mg as needed. I was afraid to take it, I have an addictive personality and my siblings have abused benzos in the past. However, I truly take it as needed! I split all of the pills in half. If I take one half before I do something that I know usually triggers an attack, I'm good to go but I'm not usually THAT lucky. If I feel an attack  coming on, I take one half. I usually wait 15-30 minutes and take the second half ONLY IF NEEDED.  I have come to find that this has been the best thing for my anxiety in conjunction with the Paroxetine.",10,20
Clonazepam,A new doctor switched me from lorazepam to this a few years ago. It was awful. I had horrific nightmares and was afraid to go to sleep. I know that sounds juvenile but I was truly afraid. I didn't get much sleep for the four days I was on it. A few naps in the afternoon. Thankfully I wasn't working but I felt horrible. Thing that scared me enough to tell the doctor it wasn't working for me: drove to the airport to pick up my husband and I had no recall of how I got there.,0,4
Clonazepam,"Yes stopped anxiety in its tracks BUT and a big but it is very addictive and getting off of it has been very difficult EVEN when using a titration method of slowly decreasing dose.  I went as high as taking 3mg over a 3-year period.  The withdrawal from this drug for me was incredible it's been a month that I have been off of it and the anxiety and brain fog are intense, I'm hoping this goes away over time as it's very difficult to concentrate.  Do your homework BEFORE taking this medicine.  Be well.",8,13
Clonazepam,Had terrible anxiety attacks .Have been on 0.5 mg for years. Really helped.,10,23
Clonazepam,"So, I used to have pretty debilitating anxiety. When I finally went to my doctor, he diagnosed me with a panic disorder and gave me clonazopam. Like any other drug of this sort, how responsible you are with medicine should determine if you take this or not. He gave to to me and told me to take it once at night when I went to bed, and then as needed if I was having a panic attack. This made me a little bit drowsy in the morning, so I stopped taking it at night and switched to just as needed which he said was fine. I have 1mg tablets, and take 1/2 at a time. I TRULY TAKE THIS AS NEEDED, and have never needed to increase my dose. At sight of a panic attack (maybe 3x a month now, used to be everyday) I take one, and it goes away.",10,33
Clonazepam,"This medication was useful for the first few months but I have spent the last six tapering and getting off of it, it is truly poison and was NEVER meant to be taken long term, you will develop a tolerance keep needing more and more to achieve the same affect, it causes memory issues, fertility problems and increased anxiety over time, agoraphobia and depression. Getting off of it almost ruined my life but was the best decision I ever made, please for the love of all do not ever touch this medication, there are other ways",2,20
Clonazepam,"Have taken these for a few yrs and its given me my life back. Its a much more even keel positive experience than say valium or xanax. It comes on slowly and lasts for a decent amount of time. I can't say anything negative about it.  I've gone a few days without it and never experienced anything dramatic. I think and function very well under klonapin, and it gets a 10 in my book.",10,38
Clonazepam,"Fantastic All I have to say I have bad anxiety since high school.  Had social issues in school for as long as I can remember and it affected me severely even into the college years.  Should have had it prescribed years earlier, but it has worked incredibly well for me since 2013. I ONLY take AS TRULY NEEDED.....this can be very addictive, so one MUST USE RESPONSIBLY. P.S. Xanax sucked.",10,29
Clonazepam,"I've suffered from severe agoraphobia and anxiety for about two years now. I missed so many opportunities because I was a scared of leaving my comfort-zone and I was experiencing a panic attack. I tried Celexa for a time, but it wasn't helpful and I continued to get worse and worse. Eventually, I felt severe anxiety whenever I left my house and experienced panic attacks on any trip that took longer than 10-15 minutes. Trying clonazepam has COMPLETELY changed my life for that better. Just 1.5 mg and suddenly I can travel 30-40 minutes down town, no anxiety or panic in sight. I've been going out more, confident and happier than I've ever been- I finally remember what it was like to live without agoraphobia. I owe everything to this wonderful drug!!",10,48
Clonazepam,"It works well. Benzos are very helpful if used appropriately. I take 1-2 mg twice a day and I have my life back. Everybody is different. I'm a male in my 20's with a family history of anxiety, and I prefer Klonopin over Xanax for sure. Dosage is relative to the specific individual and their symptoms.

I finally sleep through the night, I don't wake up groggy, and it lasts throughout the next day because I can do the things I Never was able to do before.

I was completely dependent on clonazepam after 30 days, and remained on it for about eight years, before I realized I had to get off of clonazepam, if I wanted a chance to become healthy again.  It took me 7 horrifying months to taper off, and I became disabled during that time.  I lost about 85% of my long and short term memory during that time.

So they decided to put me in a psychiatrist. They give me some med but it didn't help me that much. I went to other doctor this time gave me this wonderful med rivotril.

He decided we should try clonazepam next just to get my acute episodes of anxiety under control and OMG, what a difference!!! I literally cried from relief after taking my first dose, because it made me feel completely normal again. My only side effect is the occasional headache a day after taking it.

I didn't know the reason, I have fibromyalgia and I am on Pristine 50 mg, Neurontin and Skelaxin, and other medications. About 2 hours ago I felt an anxiety episode and I decide to take one Klonopin pill, and after 30 minutes the crying feeling just started. Now I am wondering if that is the reason.

Prior to taking Clonazepam, I was under tremendous stress due to work, and was suffering 2 -3 panic attacks per day. Since starting on 3 x 1mg per day. I have not had a single major panic attack. Anxiety and stress just disappear! It has also proved useful, on occasion, to help with sleep. Initially, it did make me very drowsy, but this passed within 3-4 days. Thanks to this medication, I have my life back! Would  recommend to anyone with a similar diagnosis of generalized Anxiety and Panic disorders.

It's fast acting and it helps with panic attacks and similar situations. But to take it day in and day out seems ludicrous. Klonopin has a much longer half life and I don't feel withdrawal when I come off klonopin, that's not the case with Xanax.

My dosage was high (Started 2MGX 3 Day and Eventually 2MG X4 a day)  I was on 2 MG X 4 a day for well over 20 years and getting off has been almost impossible, even in a detox center.

Clonazepam,"<b>Klonopin (clonazepam):</b>			 Yes, this medication works. It works very well for chronic anxiety disorder and  sudden onsets of severe panic attacks. Knowing what I know now, I wish with all my being it had never ever been prescribed to me, and without the absurd nonchalance dozens of practitioners have portrayed.  I'm 32 and have been prescribed clonazopam for 14 years. Ive been in situations where my health insurance is in transition and I must go off the medication abruptly-- this is when I realized how deep I was. Weeks upon weeks of non stop physical, emotional, and psychological withdrawal effects that are like hell. Words cannot accurately describe just how awful it is. This, again, has been my experience during withdrawal as a long term clonazopam patient.  All skin, especially the face, becomes numb. Vision gets fuzzy and difficult to see clearly. Panic attacks become extremely exasperated, frequent and debilitating. Severe irritability. Worst of all: a terrifying disconnection between your mind and body; as if you're an onlooker watching and feeling this horrible thing happen to you, but not actually feeling connected to any of it-- that one is tough to explain. All of this... It can lasts months, maybe more. That's right. Not just some one week hump to overcome.  After finding how awful the withdrawal is I've been attempting to ween very very slowly down from 3 2mg doses per day to eventually zero, hopefully. After six months of gradually decreases in dose I'm now at 2- 1mg doses per day and I'm not sure how or if I can go much less than that. No doctors I've had have been of any help. The ween down was my idea and the rate of it was also my idea based on experience. It sure would be nice to meet a doctor that truly had knowledge of this withdrawal syndrome and took it a bit more seriously. I am confident that the medication is no longer treating my anxiety disorder, but simply preventing withdrawal from the meds themselves. And there don't seem to be any good alternatives. It's a long road ahead, please think it over and over with someone knowledgeable before being so quick to embrace this miracle drug.

In elevators, in crowds, in cars if there was a lot of traffic and a million other situations. I did no research on this drug, just assumed my doctor knew best. It definitely works, probably the best anti anxiety drug on the market, and longer lasting than Xanax, however it does come at costs. Depending how much you take, or how much anxiety relief you need it can really be debilitating. If you need higher doses it can make you drowsy, cannot drive.

I think some people on here are confusing the side effects of Lexapro and other SSRIs commonly prescribed along with Klonopin. More than likely it's the SSRIs that are causing the nasty side effects and withdrawal symptoms, as I went through that myself when I stopped taking the anti-depressants.

A year ago, when I initially started Paxil (after a terrible 6 weeks of trying Zoloft), I took a Xanax because the anxiety was so bad. For some reason, the Xanax made me so depressed. Anyway, my first dose of klonopin was awesome and has been sense then, (about a week ago).

The first time I took Clonazepam was like being instantly transported from anxiety attack hell to a soothing vacation.   It was the first real relief I had had in 2 months.    3 years later and I still have a prescription for .5 mg as needed for anxiety attacks.    I get a bottle of 30 about twice a year.

Clonazepam,I am going through a very difficult time in my life with my fiance being diagnosed with stage 4 renal failure. I am the sole provider of our family and was waking up to what felt like someone scared me or a heart attack. It was so scary and when I addressed this to my Dr. He informed me that it was stress waking me up out of a dead sleep. I have had stress and anxiety before but this was entirely different from what I've been through before. I started taking this and ever since then I've been so grateful.

I just take it as needed, and I usually feel the effects within half an hour. I don't experience the sleepy side effects. But it definitely calms me down. So if I'm feeling anxious before bed, I'll take one and it helps me sleep, because it calms me. I don't take it often, 90 pills lasted me a whole year.

Was feeling my mental capacity fizzle away after a year of use and decided to get off it. Which led to 5 monhts of weening and 16 more months (and counting) of severe horrific withdrawal state.

Its easy to manage my own mood by upping or lowering my intake on the same prescription.

Nothing was working, and I was not sleeping at all, I mean literally not sleeping more than one hour night, I was not eating barely anything. It got so bad but I put my notice in at work. The nurse practitioner would not prescribe any benzodiazepine because she was worried about my history of substances abuse with alcohol. I ended up trying to kill myself by stabbing myself seven times and overdosing on my prescription medication. After that I went back to my previous psychiatrist and she prescribed me on Clonazapam.

Withdrawal has been manageable on a couple of occasions.  I am currently on .25mg/day/prn and am trying to get off of it completely per my MD.

I have had insomnia for 8 mths off of it. I think it's best to manage sleep or anxiety issues on your own because being on this stuff is not worth it.

I am on .5 mg twice a day and I am able to actually leave my house and get stuff done without that cloud of anxiety over my head. About and hour to kick in and it lasts me usually 6 hours. Then I take another around 3pm. If I find it hard to sleep I take a 3rd one right before bed and snooze away like a baby. Never have I been able to wake before 7am with no anxiety and energy for the day. I have had no side effects and I am VERY sensitive to medication. I have no plans of stopping because this med changed my life in just one day,10,34
Clonazepam,"The medication itself works very well for nerve and anxiety, however, other people don't like me on it. I either am sleeping or nodding or just an ass. You can also black out on this med and do some seriously dumb potential hurt yourself. Be careful and take as little as you can get by with.",8,14
Clonazepam,<b>Klonopin (clonazepam):</b>			 I took Klonopin daily for about a year due to a bout with anxiety and depression. I was put on an AD and added this after a few weeks as the AD was not helping my anxiety or depression. I took 0.25-0.5mg twice per day most of the time and had to change my AD twice over the first several months to get on the right one. Klonopin helped me alot during this time. I finally went back to Pristiq which had worked several years prior for me and after a few months was back to myself and with my Dr's OK I weaned off of the Klonopin and have been of it completely for almost two months now. I was terrified to stop it since I heard so many horror stories of benzo withdraw but I had no withdraw just as my Dr. had thought. Good luck!,0,64
Clonazepam,<b>Klonopin (clonazepam):</b>			 Was warned about benzo's by my first psychiatrist but in all fairness I haven't seen a (major) dosage increase. I first started with .25mg when I needed it. Mostly at night to .5mg again mostly at night. To then routinely taking .5mg in the morning and at night. Never straying to take it any more doses per day because of said addiction warnings. I have had some lapses in taking the prescribed amount for a couple days of which I paid for with loss of sleep but with any negatives I've found for this drug the positives have outweighed the negatives significantly. The biggest negative for me is the controlled substance and the hoops one must go through in order to maintain a routine for the medication.,0,56
Clonazepam,"<b>Klonopin (clonazepam):</b>			 Okay, here is the thing with Klonopin. It's a drug that works perfectly. There is literally no way to be anxious on a high enough dose, and benzos will be your saving grace if you are suffering from several panic attacks a day or even if you're catatonic. It's also got a pretty good record for being safe, far as I know. Here's the bad part. Any drug that works too well, that allows you to feel too good on it, runs a high risk of dependency. Not only that, withdrawal from this drug is miserable and painful if not done currently and under supervision. You'll be told this is not abusable as Xanax because Xanax is common among recreational drug users. That's a fallacy. Klonopin is very easy to double up on and abuse. Do not mix with alcohol.",0,69
Clonazepam,"I was prescribed 0.5 mgs twice a day as needed. Usually take it in the morning around 8 or 9 am and take the other around 7 or 8 pm. Klonopin is a life saver!! I was on Xanax before, but found that it made me zombie like and no matter how little or how much I would take, it didn't help my social anxiety like I needed, which is what I needed help for the most. I've been on klonopin for a few months and have never felt better since my anxiety started to emerge (about 3 1/2 years ago, I'm 21 now) it's definitely boosted my confidence especially in social situations. I'm also been prescribed 60mg of adderall a day, have been for over 10 years. Both combined definitely help when working.",9,20

However, my advice would be to make sure that you are working with your doctor if deciding to cut down on/taper off of Klonopin.  I weaned my dose off without talking to my doc a few times.  Mostly OK (days of some side effects notwithstanding), however, once it was pretty bad.  I recall feeling -- edgy -- all day at work, and then later that night feeling horrible.  I didn't want to eat, I cried, and I kept having anxious thoughts.  I would not recommend leaving Klonopin cold turkey unless you really feel ready.",0,39

I just could not face the real world before Klonopin and now I have been completely able to live a normal, happy and productive life.

Not sure if it's doing much. We'll see in about another 4 weeks if I can stop the Klonopin. I have to agree with others, Xanax works well and quickly, but leaves your system quicker and leaves you more anxious.

This is good because you always want to be aware of side effects other medications have on you.  I had the perfect balance of medications and was doing very good.

In fact - though I wasn't depressed per se - I subjectively experienced the lessening of my anxiety as positive and consequently my mood improved.

Klonopin made me cough and increased the thickness of the mucus in my lungs until it was almost impossible to cough it up.  Just to be SURE it was the Klonopin and not something else, I have given it two other tries 1/4 of a 0.5 mg tablet.  Each time the same results.

Clonazepam,"I was just prescribed clonazepam for moderate anxiety, and it's working well for me compared to other anti-anxiety medications I've tried. Lorazepam was great for sudden panic attacks but it made me sleepy and clumsy, and didn't last long enough and had too many side effects for general day-to-day nervousness. Same with Xanax, and even Xanax XR. Clonazepam is great because I can take it in the morning, and have a very steady, reliable feeling of calmness for hours. Sometimes I'll take a second dose in the afternoon but not always. The only downside to this medicine is that it doesn't work as fast as Xanax or lorazepam, but for persistent feelings of worry and anxiety throughout the day, this medicine does wonders.",8,6

Clonazepam,"This medicine works the best of all the benzodiazepines for me. It has completely wiped out my anxiety and has zero side effects at my prescribed dose (2.5mgs a day total).

I don't think enough doctors stress the dependence factor of this medicine (it is very difficult to withdraw from, you need to decrease your dose very slowly over a long period of time), so educate yourself if it is prescribed to you and use the lowest effective dose. The pros outweigh the cons for me by far though.",10,6

I had two incidents of crying uncontrollably and they upped the medicine to 1 to 3 per day.  This made me sleep a lot during the day. Finally the psychiatrist did a medical check and has changed my medications to different times of the day and has the clonazepam 1 to 3 times on as needed basis.  He said I could also cut them in half and take 1/2 the dosage at a time to keep from sleeping all the time.

There is mild drowsiness, but it doesn't affect my day too much. The major side effect is the weight gain!! Mt doctor did not tell me that increased appetite and weight gain is a possible side effect and now I am finally putting two and two together. The weight gain started off slow, but now after being on the medication for 2 months and upping my dose to twice a day, I am gaining 4-6lbs a week! I have been increasing my exercise regimen and eating healthier than ever before and I am still gaining weight. Very effective drug for anxiety, but beware of the side effects!",7,17
Hydroxyzine,I was given hydroxyzine for anxiety driving my dose was 25 mg. I can take up to 75 mg dose.  I feel absolutely nothing it makes no difference.  Was I given placebo for some reason?  This is the first time I have had a prescription med for panic attacks.  I prefer not to use medications for help.,1,12
Hydroxyzine,"<b>Atarax (hydroxyzine):</b>			 I have been taking atarax for about 2 years now and I can honestly say its such a relief for my anxiety . The only thing about the medication is it doesnt have a long effect like other medications . So I take this medication 3x a day . I suffer from PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder and my anxiety and worry is over the roof , when I take this medication it has a calming effect and Im able to think logically and calm myself down if I start getting anxious . I have not gained weight on it I been in my weight loss journey with this medication and havent had a weight gain issue . I recommend this medication !",0,50
Hydroxyzine,I started hydroxyzine for anxiety a month ago. I am on two 10mg a day. It has been amazing for my anxiety and got rid of the very bad physical symptoms. However my doctor is now saying he's not allowed to prescribe it because I am on quetiapine and propranolol. Apparently he says it increases the chance of heart arrythemia/ heart attack. Why didn't they say this before I got used to it. I'm devastated. Any alternatives would be appreciated. Thanks guys,9,5
Hydroxyzine,"I take hydroxyzine for when the anxiety is too much to handle. I have GAD and PTSD. If you know general anxiety everything freaks you out so panic attacks are quite frequent. This medicine does the job for me. But it works too well. Every time I take this I sleep for 14+hrs and am still tired when I wake up. I take 25mg as needed and usually only take one capsule. It does usually stop the panic attacks within 30 minutes, and the anxiety within 2-3 hours. You experience extremely vivid dreams from this medicine. Overall it's okay. I can't recommend it unless your anxiety disables you to the point of not being able to work. Because as much as you'll sleep you're gonna lose your job.",6,10
Hydroxyzine,"Just didnt do anything, even when I took two (says take 1-2 as needed).",1,2
Hydroxyzine,"<b>Vistaril (hydroxyzine):</b>			 Listen Vitaril pretty decent for anxiety! I was on this 25mg 3x daily and it has helped take off the edge, it doesn't stop it 100% but with other medication and proper anxiety relief techniques, this will help you immensely with anxiety. However since I'm a teen drop out (due to anxiety) I can sleep 9 hours and then sleep another 9 hours W/O feeling tired at all (great side affect- I like). I highly recommend this for people with panic attacks! Don't listen to the scary reviews if you truely have tried everything except meds TRY THIS and don't be scared...",0,43
Hydroxyzine,My doctor started me on hydroxyzine for my anxiety over a year ago and it has helped me a lot when I get anxiety attacks and need to calm down. It usually takes about 30 minutes for me to feel the effect of this medication. It also makes me extremely tired when Im not having an anxiety attack so my doctor told me to use it at night to help with my sleep. Im very happy with how it has helped me in the past year.,9,16
Hydroxyzine,"Went to the urgent care for difficulty sleeping. Was given this medication to take as needed for anxiety. I only take it at night because it makes me extremely drowsy. I have been taking it every night for three weeks now and it helps me tremendously. I haven't experienced any side effects, and I have very restful sleep without daytime drowsiness. I would recommend!",10,13
Hydroxyzine,Useless for my anxiety/ panic attacks.,1,6
Hydroxyzine,"Reading peoples experiences is incredible because this medication has been amazing for me.  8/10 because it makes you EXHAUSTED. I mean Im on 50mg twice a day or when required (100mg max per day) and sometimes I take 150 if I know its gonna be a particularly stressful day or I have to speak publicly at all.  But overall, this has decreased my anxiety and kept me from starting benzos which is great because I appreciate a doctor who doesnt jump right for them.  I have bipolar disorder so Im also on wellbutrin 450, lamotrigine 200 x2 a day, and topamax 150. Wellbutrin has helped the exhaustion, so If youre looking for a good antidepressant to pair up with it thats a safe bet.",8,12
Hydroxyzine,"I take hydroxyzine 10 mg twice a day or as needed. It helps take the edge off anxiety and keeps me grounded. I've also noticed it helps me have better, deeper sleep.It does make you thirsty, but my doctor told me about that. Depending on how much activity I've had the day before it can make me sleepy. I've noticed that my appetite has increased and I crave carbs, however I am unsure if it's from the medication or from the reduction of anxiety. I've also noticed that though I've increased my workouts to balance my appetite, I've put on about 7 pounds in the past month or so. I am tall and relatively slender so it's not so much of an issue after I did some research of my own and learned that weight gain was common, but my doctor did not tell me a slower metabolism a possible side effect prior. Other than drinking LOTS of water to stay hydrated and to attempt to curb overeating, I am satisfied with this medication and learning to love the extra cushion it brings.",7,12
Hydroxyzine,I have some pretty bad anxiety - especially when it comes to around the time I go to sleep. This has helped me so much and is the only one that has worked so well. Haven't experienced any negative side effects from it so far.,10,18
Hydroxyzine,Does not make me sleepy or less anxious.,1,14
Hydroxyzine,"Ok so my doctor's PA gave me hydroxyzine to ease my nighttime itchiness (eczema) and it's started making me shake severely, have tightness in my chest, and makes my breathing feel a little laboured. Unfortunately, she has me on other meds to which I'm beginning to believe I'm allergic to. Going to stop taking hydroxyzine until I can see my new doctor. Don't ignore these horrible symptoms as they're not normal! 3-5 hours to go before it's supposed to work its way out of my system...this.is.awful.",5,10
Hydroxyzine,"my doctor prescribed me 25mg Hydroxyzine for my severe anxiety, social anxiety panic attacks and PTSD. I take 1/2 tabs four times daily as needed for my severe anxiety. I am giving this drug a 8 because it does NOT work with panic attacks but it does work amazing with anxiety. I am also on Xanax 1 mg as needed for my severe panic attacks which I usually have about 2-3 times a day. Some days are better and worst but Hydroxyzine been helping keep me calm. Also I am on 60mg of Cymbalta and this stuff works amazing. So with  the combo xanax, hydroxyzine and cymbalta, my life is back to normal and social anxiety panic attacks and PTSD controlled and  I feel myself again.",8,17
Hydroxyzine,"<b>Vistaril (hydroxyzine):</b>			 My doctor prescribed this medication as needed for anxiety a few days ago. She told me to take 25 to 50 mg a day, as needed. I took 25 mg and it was horrible. I had chest tightness, felt like I couldn't breathe. Chest pain, the pain was shooting through to my back. I thought about going to the ER. I still had anxiety yesterday, took the vistaril the day before. Still dealing with anxiety today. I don't think I'll ever take it again. The anxiety I had before wasn't this bad. Just to let everyone know, I don't take benzos for anxiety. One of the reviews for this medication made a comment about people taking benzos, it said that's why people don't like Vistaril because they would rather have benzos, that is not the case. This medication doesn't work well for some people. I have better results using my DARE app, and meditation.",0,19
Hydroxyzine,<b>Vistaril (hydroxyzine):</b>			 I was prescribed this medication for insomnia and anxiety. Prescription said take 2 pills 25 mg twice daily as needed. I took one pill before sleep and it did not help at all for a couple days. Then I tried 2 pills. Walked to my bedroom and passed out en route. I was knocked unconscious. Woke up with severely broken ankle and drenched in sweat on bedroom floor. Very terrifying  experience I regret taking these pills. No warning of this effect was mentioned to me. I blacked out from them. I was also taking Trintillex for about 2 weeks for depression. Don't know if this contributed to the blackout. I was told they were mild like benadryl but calming. Not the case for me. Too late now have 2 more weeks of broken ankle non weight bearing and I am very angry I was prescribed this drug.,0,12
Hydroxyzine,"Taking 50 mg before bed. Go to sleep quickly, but wake up 3 or 4 times from bad dreams.  Very tired and sleepy next day. I can't take the dreams anymore so will stop taking.  Hope I do not have any withdrawal. I also hate when you tell you psychiatrist about the side effects and they claim have never heard of these side effects.  Doctor's think they know everything,  I'm here to say they DON'T.",5,15
Hydroxyzine,"I was prescribed hydroxyzine for anxiety and sleep issues. My anxiety was really bad; I struggled with racing thoughts, nausea, and vomiting, which kept me from sleeping. My doctor started me out on 10mg-20mg a night, which did wonders for my anxiety (and allergies) but didn't help with sleep. She told me to try 30mg. It didn't put me to sleep, but I felt the quality of sleep was better, in the end. The next morning, I had trouble waking up. I couldn't drive to work. I took a two hour nap and felt fine when I woke back up. Still left me a little tired throughout the day, but it worked.  Be aware of drowsiness the morning after taking this and give yourself a little extra time to come around.",10,18
Hydroxyzine,"This is one of the most terrifying  drug reactions I have EVER experienced! My Dr prescribed hydroxyzine to me almost 2 weeks ago thinking it would help me with severe anxiety panic attacks and insomnia. Needless to say this drug did the exact opposite  I wake up sweating, horrifying dreams, severe dizziness and confusion severe nausea. Not tired, but VERY groggy I haven't been able to go to my classes the side effects from this drug is unbearable! My chest is tight I can't catch my breath! My head is spinning so uncontrollably! I can't think. I can't get the correct words out to have a conversation! 3-6 migraines a day. I haven't been able to drive, go to work or school for the last 2 weeks!! Been fighting for air in my sleep....wake up feeling like I'm being suffocated! Oh!! This made my life 100 times worse than before! Oh!! I almost forgot..as I'm writing this review I'm laying in a hospital bed because of this medication!! Please be careful when taking this med!",1,17
Hydroxyzine,"This drug hydroxyzine sucks for anxiety! I used to be a healthy 34 year old in good shape and great amounts of energy. Well I have taken hydroxyzine for two years now and guess what, almost 50lbs I have gained increasingly fast.  I look like a train wreck, I don't eat that much and am a very - well was - a very active guy. This medication ruined me! Anyone, if your psychiatrist tries to get you to take this medicine if your having terrible anxiety, depression or even withdrawal, don't take this medicine cause in the end you will get more depressed, get fat and probably want to use meth to drop the excess lbs you gained from this stupid drug....",2,12
Hydroxyzine,"I was prescribed hydroxyzine to help with my anxiety and insomnia. I've taken 50mg daily for the last 6 years and it works great for both problems. My doctor recently refused to renew my prescription so I've been off of it for about 3 days. This evening I started itching from my scalp to my feet. My clothes feel like sandpaper and any movement sets off more itching.  I am guessing this is a symptom of withdrawal since being off of it is the only thing different in my life. Will definitely be talking to my doctor about renewing the prescription because, in addition to the itching, I'm back to not being able to sleep at night.",8,7
Hydroxyzine,"I suffer with severe anxiety attacks, that sometimes turn into panic attacks. I suffer with major anxiety everyday of my life. Its been debilitating. I went to the doctor and was given this to combat my anxiety &amp; panic attacks. I took my first pill last night and after an hour, I felt very tired. I slept for 10 hours. Helped calm me down, and I slept great. Woke up feeling a bit groggy, but the anxiety is non-existent for me this morning. That NEVER happens. I was given 50 mg. to take every 6 hours as needed. Im 54 and 115 lbs, so I cant imagine how groggy Id feel taking more than one a day. I am glad I have found something that isnt addictive as a benzodiazepine, and helps me sleep while helping my anxiety tremendously. Just be cautious and follow your doctors orders. Just wanted to share my experience in hopes it may help someone. Stay encouraged!",9,43
Hydroxyzine,"I feel taking hydroxyzine for anxiety is like this 90% of a placebo effect. It is basically benadryl so it makes you sleepy which may make you feel more calm. Unfortunately, I can still feel anxious and groggy at the same time so this was not effective. However, since I am in recovery, benzos are not an option for me so this is pretty much all I can take besides a maintenance GAD medication. (On that note, I highly recommended Buspirone.)",0,5
Hydroxyzine,Doctors prescribe hydroxyzine instead of medications that work for anxiety and panic to cover their backsides.  Hydroxyzine is a sedative that does essentially nothing for anxiety and panic.,1,17
Hydroxyzine,"<b>Atarax (hydroxyzine):</b>			 Ive been taking this medication Atarax for 4 years now, I take it for my severe panic and anxiety attacks it has helped me so much ! This medicine is wonderful! Its a sedative that dr uses for patients after surgery or before ! Those who dont really know about it here you go! Atarax (hydroxyzine) reduces activity in the central nervous system. It also acts as an antihistamine that reduces the natural chemical histamine in the body. Histamine can produce symptoms of sneezing and runny nose, or hives on the skin. Atarax is used as a sedative to treat anxiety and tension! But it also helps me sleep at night when I feel a panic attack come on I take one and go to sleep witch thats what I want thanks to this medicine!!!!",0,38
Hydroxyzine,hydroxyzine was prescribed to me for anxiety after a stillbirth and now I'm so tired all day long that I can't function well enough to take care of my living child. I hate that this drug is offered as an alternative to benzodiazepines. At least I can function during the day on those.,1,6
Hydroxyzine,Hydroxyzine does not and never has worked. I've been on this drug for 4 yrs and is a useless drug for my anxiety.,1,11
Hydroxyzine,"I just recently started Sertraline and found it to cause anxiety and nausea  when  starting up and an increase symptom. I was already on 0.5 clonazepam twice daily and have built a tolerance to it, so it wasn't helping and both my doc and I felt it wasn't a good time to wean off while starting up a new medication until I was on the correct dose and settled. So I asked for hydroxyzine, which I was previously prescribed from a different doctor. I was prescribed 50mg 3x a day, but I take it as needed, usually once or twice a day, sometimes not at all.  While it doesn't calm like a benzo, it does make you a little tired which can in turn help take the edge off anxiety. It is great for helping with sleep. I do find it has caused me to feel like I need to eat after taking it and I have gained a bit of weight on it as a result, but other than that, I am happy with it.",8,9
Hydroxyzine,"Anxiety: 25mg for anxiety relief was not effective at all, like trying to stop a freight train with a film of Saran Wrap. Allergies:  It worked wonderfully when taking it 3x a day. Insomnia:   Was first given in hospital at a massive dose. I was flattered for nearly two days with that dose. Tried 100mg, and it didnt work, wide awake. In fact, I felt speedy- heart palpitations and anxious. Weight Gain:  Something my Dr. nor pharmacist told me about. I had no idea...insidious little spoken of side effect. Thought it was my other medications, gained 20lbs and have been struggling to lose it.  I had been averaging losing 1lb a month while taking the drug.  Ive stopped the drug and pray the remaining 17lbs are much easier to lose. Hydroxyzine wasnt a good drug for me, didnt  offer any real return on investment.",1,5
Hydroxyzine,I have recently been experiencing panic attacks and uncontrollable anxiety. After using hydroxyzine my chest finally didnt feel tight anymore and I was able to get a good nights rest. The next day I felt a little groggy but much less anxious and able to focus better.,10,18
Hydroxyzine,I take 25mg hydroxyzine once a day for anxiety and it helped me a lot! I do not have nothing bad to say about this meds....Ive been dealing with my Mom's death and this meds has helped me out a lot!,9,29
Hydroxyzine,"After initially dismissing this drug a few years ago when I was still drinking heavily, I've now found that Hydroxyzine really does wonders for my intense anxiety and moodiness.  Along with tyrosine, GABA, theanine, and folic acid, it seems to really lift my mood and I feel very happy like the fun hypomania.  If I'm singing to music and talking a lot, I'm in a great mood and that's what this med does.  I'm bipolar 1 and my moodiness gets intense when I'm in a mixed state or bad mania.   I currently take 50 mg x 3 per day and I'm also on Trileptal 600 mg x 2 a day and Lamictal 200 mg per day for bipolar depression.  The Trileptal does great for capping my mania but it doesn't do it for my acute anxiety that leads to the moodiness.  Most people are not on anywhere near the dosage I'm at, like 10 - 25 mg or so.  But I'm 6 ft  240 pounds and I need a lot of every med I take to be effective.",10,10
Hydroxyzine,"I had an awful experience with hydroxyzine for sleep and anxiety. It helped me fall asleep and stay asleep, however I could not wake up in the morning no matter how much sleep I got. I was missing work... Also, I was tired all. the. time. My productivity was shot. The worst of it all, my anxiety was worse and I was beginning to get depressed and lost my cheerful personality. Now this may be related to my lack of productivity, they are very much linked due to my personality. However it came about, hydroxyzine ruined my life for the short period I was on it. I was elated when I isolated the problem and even more so when I stopped taking it and I began to return to my old self. For potential users- be aware of possible negative effects on the exact thing you're most likely seeking help for. Everyone is different, but FYI.",2,14
Hydroxyzine,Ive been on this pill for about 3 days now and its working wonders for me so far. I was sore for a couple of days but I think thats cause I was so tensed all the time! It does take awhile to kick in but I have noticed a decrease in my panic thought process. I hope it gets better these next few weeks! Thank God!,10,20
Hydroxyzine,"I don't really get why everyone dislikes this drug so much! I've been on benzos before and although those do help in a different way, knowing this won't be so addictive makes me feel at ease. A huge game changer was the fact that it didn't leave me with a huge depression 'hangover' once it wears off. The thing I don't like about it is that it can put me in a sort of a brain foggy state, but personally I am used to dealing with that. I take usually 25mg and I'm set for a while. I have anxiety+social anxiety and there is a difference for me I can tell when I take it. I don't usually leave reviews but I keep seeing so many negative things about hydroxyzine online that just makes me want to share my experience for those who might feel discouraged when being put on it.",8,56
Hydroxyzine,"I found my anxiety solved by meditation and breathing exercises.  The drugs prescribed damaged my body/my cholesterol/blood pressure/anxiety/finances, etc.  I am life long athlete, in excellent text book good health at age 65.  Until I survived a trauma and Drs began taking advantage of me and my health programs paid by me.  Get your health care statements/medicare statements/health care statements - compare what your records say to what you remember AND to what they billed you and your heath care/Medicare.",1,9
Hydroxyzine,I just started taking this pill yesterday &amp; honestly I feel no different but it sure did help me sleep &amp; I love it. I gotta continue taking it so I can have a different experience Im guessing. The dr prescribed me 25MG &amp; to take the pill 3 times a day.,0,11
Hydroxyzine,"<b>Vistaril (hydroxyzine):</b>			 I was given Vistaril for severe GAD with panic attacks.  Very soon after taking the first one my anxiety tripled and I began having back to back panic attacks.  After a call to the doctor I was told to take a higher dose. Long story short, for whatever reason, I can not take this medication.  It has the complete opposite effect on me as it should.",0,35
Hydroxyzine,"This company wants you to leave a review as they like, but have to say this medication I stared to  make me feel like I wanted to run, the anxiety was so extreme and I was just talking to my self. What is wrong with me because, I just took my medicine right, guess what, I was having a rash for a week, but did not put together.  Then I stop all my meds, and took hydroxyzine 75mg . The anxiety was really bad, I developed hives, was no longer a rash. Plus gain weight, like I need more pounds. Read, read, read before you take any medication. Don't believe all they say it will do. The info is there, read it, please!!!!",0,15
Hydroxyzine,"<b>Atarax (hydroxyzine):</b>			 I recently had anxiety trigger for me and I had a very scary panic attack that woke me from a dead sleep. My GP prescribed Atarax 10 mg form. I do not take anything regularly so I was a tad apprehensive.  However I was reading and saw that people take much more higher doses on the medication, so I assumed it wasnt going to work - wrong  It takes a little bit to get the full effect but once it happens I was out like a light. I also woke up a little groggy, but my day has been better than ever.  I slept finally fully and o didnt have tightness of chest at work or during the day.  10mg is plenty and I didnt have any weird dreams or side effects. I will say just having the bottle provided me calmness before I went to bed.  I look forward to another night of rest.",0,46
Hydroxyzine,"This drug hydroxyzine worked for my anxiety, however it caused bad nausea and dizziness the following day, even when taking a half dose. It sucks to find something that works but the side effects were anxiety invoking themselves. I had to stop it.",4,11
Hydroxyzine,"I was given this for anxiety, I was originally given 10mg and told to take 1  a day at night, it worked for a little while but stopped, so they upped me to 50mg (!!!!)  Last night I took half of the 50mg (25mg) pill because I was nervous about taking the whole thing, (I'm underweight) and I wake up this morning feeling hyperfocused on some things, not focused at all on others, SEVERELY anxious about some things and not anxious at all with others.  I slept until noon (that never happens, I'm usually up between 6-8AM), it is 3pm right now and I could definitely fall asleep but I'm forcing myself not to. I don't enjoy this pill, it's making me feel funky and my motor skills are off and my brain is fuzzy, I have worse racing thoughts and its like my panic disorder is worse. I'm sick right now too, and I'm already washing all of my bedding and I want to peel my skin off and wash it from the inside out. It's frustrating.",0,18
Hydroxyzine,"I think that this is an amazing drug for individuals who have yet to be on a Benzo. I am seeing a lot of reviews by people who have previously been on Benzo, and it's hard to compare the two because Benzos have addicting properties. As an individual who hasn't been on one, I think Hydroxizine is absolutely amazing. I will say that this is not a medication that you can take throughout the day unless you want to be extremely tired. However, this medication has helped me fall asleep at night, and has lessened my anxiety. You can literally feel the tension being lifted out of your body as the medication is kicking in. I would recommend this drug! It's genuinely been a game changer for me.",10,46
Hydroxyzine,"My MD prescribed hydroxyzine for anxiety. I got night sweats, dizziness, headaches...and more. I was taking it for 2 months. It made my anxiety worse so I stopped it totally. Be careful with this med, try not to take it. I am feeling really good now and spent time going out to social worlds again. I wish everyone the best. You are stronger than you think.",1,24
Hydroxyzine,"I was recently prescribed this medication at night for anxiety and insomnia. So far, I definitely helps me fall asleep. It also makes me feel a little sleepy the next day as well. But I have definitely noticed a decrease in anxiety. Those racing thoughts have slowed considerably and my body feels very relaxed and tension free.",7,32
Hydroxyzine,Crappy pill ! Will help you sleep but it makes you so drowsey the next day you can barely wake up at all. Feels like you been drugged and makes you twitch during the night.,1,14
Hydroxyzine,"I was prescribed this hydroxyzine for anxiety. It has not helped my anxious feelings or tendencies in the slightest. Now I just have no energy to do anything. I fall asleep in every class almost uncontrollably, and if I sit down in one place for about 5 minutes I begin to doze off. I am 5 3 and 100 pounds. I wouldnt really recommend this for anxiety issues",5,17
Hydroxyzine,My Dr prescribed this hydroxyzine to help with my anxiety and sleep. I never did get a chance to use it for sleep but I did take it a couple of times for anxiety. Honestly felt worse. The first time I thought I was just having a terrible attack and the medication just wasn't cutting it. Then I tried it on another occasion. My heart palpations were horrible. So needless to say I won't be taking it again. It may work great for some but it only made things worse for me.,1,17
Hydroxyzine,"Hydroxyzine was worthless for me. Doctor prescribed this for panic attacks, want to know what they're smoking.",2,25
Hydroxyzine,"<b>Atarax (hydroxyzine):</b>			 Ive been taking atarax for anxiety after my doctor took me off clonopin. It is a hard battle I have with myself now, I am getting more panic attacks now but not as strong because of atarax its still hard especially when my panic attacks come at night now.",0,38
Hydroxyzine,"<b>Vistaril (hydroxyzine):</b>			 My psychiatrist prescribed me Vistaril for anxiety after trying plenty of other drugs. (Celexa, Lexapro and Klonopin I was also trying other drugs like Prozac, Ritalin and intuniv). The first couple days it had made me tired but a like with all antihistamines I've ever taken, it wears off incredibly quickly and I build a tolerance quite quickly. I was specifically prescribed it for anxiety but as far as that goes, I haven't noticed a difference whatsoever. My anxiety is pretty severe and I've had it since I was really young. Although, everyone is different and this will work differently for everyone.  I have been taking it for about three and a half weeks and the only reason I still take it is because I get nausea and allergies. But I haven't noticed a dent in my anxiety with it. I've always needed something relatively strong for my anxiety.",0,33
Hydroxyzine,So I know everyone's body is different some meds work for others and some don't. But I will say this medication really does help me anytime I'm feeling anxious or having a panic attack I will take one and even though it takes a while to kick in it really does help. I'm also prescribed clonazepam and I take that with it and that really helps but on the days that I don't take the clonazepam the hydroxyzine makes me feel really drowsy really relaxed it like removes all the tension and the nervousness and the anxiousness from my body I hope that this helps.,9,44
Hydroxyzine,Hydroxyzine reminds me of Deplin. The medicine makes anxiety worse. Definitely feels like it creates panic disorder. Staying on it for longer than a week would probably send me to the hospital. Do not recommend this medication.,2,19
Hydroxyzine,"This stuff (hydroxyzine) doesn't do much for me honestly I'm thinking about just trying to Xanex somehow again because my Doctor won't give me anything that works. I probably won't but I want too. My doc knows that I'm a former addict. I've been sober for 2 years now. Seriously though, hydoxyzine is garbage. Don't notice a difference with my anxiety at all. I even have panic attacks on a regular basis and I still can't find a doc who will even give me a try with benzos which work best for me. I don't even care just need something that works. Sorry about my ranting just wanted to get that out lol. Does anyone know what other meds there are for anxiety except Vistaril and benzos?  Maybe I should try some paroxetine or escitalopram or one from those groups and see how that goes long term.",0,15
Hydroxyzine,I have taken the 25mg hydroxyzine three times a day for about a 4 days...I hate it. Worse experience Ive ever had with an anxiety medication. Its not only made my anxiety worse but makes me so angry to the point where Im almost violent. Clearly this isnt for me.,1,30
Hydroxyzine,So Ive been on this medicine for about 7 months. It started working actually 4 months ago but at first I wasnt sure. So my doctor told me to take 2 every night. It started making me relieved and better. It reduced my anxiety symptoms but I still get anxious. But I know that medicine isn't what you should lean on.,8,19
Hydroxyzine,"Literally does nothing for anxiety, absolutely nothing. It will sedate you and calm you in a certain way its hard to explain but you will be even more anxious after taking this from the  drugged  feeling, its so uncomfortable you will sleep but it will be that half sleep if you know what I mean you will dream and be awake at the same time. The night will go by extremely slow and you will wake up sweating even worse than before.

Hydroxyzine,"Ive been taking the medication for 3 months. 25 mg tab 1-2 per day. I use it to help with my insomnia and severe anxiety. It worked for the first 2 months but faded quickly. I upped my dose to 3 pills, then 4 in the past month because of how fast its fading. Now I just dont feel right. I cant explain it.",4,15
Hydroxyzine,"Since starting this medication, I feel that it truly has only helped me once or twice. In the very beginning it would lessen the anxiety and actually made me have a good nights sleep. But now, it does nothing for me. Im very saddened by this because it just seems like there is nothing out there that can help with my anxiety.",4,17
Hydroxyzine,Hydroxyzine worked when I first got on it. I was told that it didn't cause tolerance. Now it's been a year and it doesn't do anything anymore. It used to make me feel tired and relaxed but I don't get those effects anymore. I hate this stupid med,2,9
Hydroxyzine,Although the medication does calm you down and make you sleepy it does literally nothing for anxiety except make it a little worse you will sleep but you will be half asleep the whole time with terrible dreams and you will practically wake up sweating from this.,6,14
Hydroxyzine,"I've been using hydroxyzine regularly for about 5 years for panic attacks and generalized anxiety, taking 25-50mg as needed. I often take it before bed since that is generally when I have higher anxiety. It can make me mildly drowsy but not consistently. I can take it during the day and function just fine. If I'm highly anxious it doesn't make me sleepy, just calms things down. More often than not it doesn't completely get rid of anxiety, particularly the racing thoughts (I find Ativan and Xanax more effective for that particular symptom), but it makes it significantly more manageable. I've never had any bad side effects from it, just dry mouth sometimes.  I would recommend trying it.",8,28
Hydroxyzine,<b>Atarax (hydroxyzine):</b>			 I love this medication!! I take it for PTSD related sleep disturbance. It literally cured my insomnia. It works like a charm and I only take it probably once a week now. It feels good just to have it as my security blanket though. It does make me feel a bit drowsy the next day but its so worth it to not have a night when Im up until 3 am with insane anxiety. Its also safe for people who are in recovery! Huge plus!,0,33
Hydroxyzine,This is okay for anxiety issues. It is a steady calm. I had valium a few years ago and would alternate with hydroxyzine. The valium was for fresh trauma to myself. I would recommend the valium for a true 10 response if your anxiety is that horrible. I can only say hydroxyzine is ok after several years of therapy and treatment with valium.,10,10
Hydroxyzine,My psychiatrist has put me on hydroxyzine for anxiety/insomnia. Might as well pop a tic tac. Except at least a tic tac will freshen my breath as it promises. Not recommended by me for people with true anxiety issues.,1,21
Hydroxyzine,"<b>Atarax (hydroxyzine):</b>			 Atarax  is very helpful with panic attacks, so far I take it only when I'm having panic attacks, not at a regular dose, it takes about 30-60 minutes  to work and gives me a warm, safe, sleepy feeling.",0,29
Hydroxyzine,I started this medicine for anxiety and he somehow made it worse. On top of that I would wake up with nausea. Not the best experience with this.,1,13
Hydroxyzine,"I was given hydroxyzine to replace my clonazepam, which, with my C-PTSD, it's not unlike trying to empty the ocean with a tea strainer. While it does help me to sleep, it does little or nothing to mitigate my anxiety. I am bedridden, which means I can't even distract myself from my flashbacks with activity. Since I am also a pain patient, I can no longer take benzodiazepines of any kind. I really wish they had thought alternatives before instituting this ban. I hope it helps someone somewhere with their anxiety and I wish it helped me.",2,13
Hydroxyzine,"<b>Vistaril (hydroxyzine):</b>			 This is really not a drug for people with serious, long-term issues with anxiety. But it's also the lowest-risk prescription a Doctor can write, so expect to get this as a first line treatment in lieu of any personalized care. I have taken Vistaril on-and-off for nearly 10 years and while it does help in some specific circumstances, it's just not a particularly effective drug. It basically produces a mild sedative effect that can take some of the edge off of background anxiety.  If you take it on a daily basis, expect the benefits to fade somewhat. Increasing the dosage just makes you more drowsy and the side effects worse.   If you can identify in advance circumstances that make your anxiety worse, taking a Vistaril before that can help alleviate things a bit. This drug will not stop or even really affect an imminent anxiety or panic attack, and even at it's most effective it won't help with many of the side effects of anxiety (rapid heart beat, trembling, numbness etc)",0,26
Hydroxyzine,So far it works great for me. I have a lot of anxiety and hypochondria. It has helped me to calm down and relax.,10,15

This mix works great for me.",10,12
Hydroxyzine,"I've started hydroxyzine at 10 mg 2 times daily as needed. I quickly figured out that taking my morning and night dose just in the morning helps tremendously withy anxiety about watching my three year old. It makes me smile more at him and I don't have that angry hateful resentment towards him (I know it's not his fault for not being smart enough to do things.. yet.. and that's where it fixed the problem.. because I know it's not normal to let it bother me so much.. And I can interact with him better now!!  On the other hand I've been upped TODAY actually to 40 mgs as needed as it DOES get rid of the  oh no I won't be able to sleep worry.. along with 40 mgs of amitriptyline to make me drowsy.  Without the hydroxyzine if just be laying in bed.. drowsy as anything with my mind racing. So all in all I feel like a productive person who is also dealing with Cystic Fibrosis, diabetes, gastroparesis and osteoporosis!!

Hydroxyzine,"<b>Vistaril (hydroxyzine):</b>			 I have been taking 50mg of Vistaril every 4 hours for about one week. It was prescribed to me for anxiety. It has worked well and allowed me to function without panic attacks and calms me and keeps me out of fight or flight mode. Life has just been easier entirely. I have had some mild to moderate side effects specifically, a few headaches, impaired coordination and occasional dizziness. I personally would take that over the mind crushing anxiety. I would recommend avoiding operating a vehicle until you're comfortable with the medication and keep your water intake up.",0,45

Sure Im not anxious when Im sleeping, but I cant sleep 24/7!",0,27
Hydroxyzine,"I sometimes suffer from panic attacks and it makes my mind start racing, and one thing leads to another. My Shrink prescribed me Vistaril 50mg. It has helped me very much. One thing I have learned is that medication alone cannot solve all your problems, but the right medication can help relieve you from moments of stress. I would recommend Hydroxyzine to anyone who has stress problems. I take my Hydroxyzine as needed, with my daily dose of gabapentin. I would recommend Hydroxyzine to anyone who does not like Ativan.

Hydroxyzine,<b>Vistaril (hydroxyzine):</b>			 This drug is amazingly sedating. After reading the reviews I was reluctant to take it thinking it would not work. Boy was I wrong. Sadly I am starting antidepressant therapy and my anxiety is through the roof. I was given Ativan but am reluctant to take it often for fear of tolerance and addition. The Vistaril has really worked at calming me down after increased anxiety especially when worrying when trying to fall off to sleep. It shut down the worry and made me slow down which in my case is what I needed. I only took 10mg and caution against driving or other activities until you know how it will affect you.,0,28
Hydroxyzine,This is not very effective. On a very low dose 25mg every 6 hours is not doing anything for anxiety. DRIPPING  wet night sweats are a really bad side affect so I am backing off hydroxyzine. I WOULD RATHER HAVE ANXIETY,1,9
Hydroxyzine,I am using this medication as when required for anxiety. It does not work for me at all. I've tried it in the past and gotten the same results. I have chronic anxiety and I do not think this helps at all.,1,9
Hydroxyzine,I took it for one week before going to bed.  It did not help me sleep and the next day I felt like a zombie.  I was scared to drive because I could not think straight and went from bed to the couch all week.  I stopped taking it after a week.  It must have a long half life because it did not wear off until 3 pm the next day.,2,9
Hydroxyzine,"My doctor prescribed me 25mg hydroxyzine because Im having up to 4 panic/ anxiety attacks weekly, and told me to take it as needed. I also take it with sertraline which is used for my depression. Ive used it on several occasions both when I knew I would have a panic attack (night driving triggers it) or during a situation when I felt one coming on. When I took it during my panic attack, I honestly feel like it made the experience worse and more frightening. Maybe I need to take more than one at a time during an episode? However I did take one when I was feeling mildly anxious at work and within 20 minutes I was completely calmed down. No more racing thoughts, or fast heart beat. Only side effects Ive had are slight drowsiness and on one occasion a headache. Going to stay on it with an optimistic attitude before I give up on it completely! :)",7,18

I could sleep all day when I take this stuff. Probably not the best solution for anyone with a lot of daily responsibilities. Other side effects I think have come along with it are dry mouth and increase in appetite. I don't remember being this hungry before. Would I recommend it? Ugh... I think the fact it eliminates my attacks  pretty much all together is worth the cons I mentioned but I'm still gonna be trying some alternatives to see if theres something that doesn't make me feel as tired.

I loved the low dose Klonepin but after several years it now has affected my short term memory.  The Vistaril, since it is like an antihistamine, has such drying effects on me that I am always hoarse and have migraines due to dehydration. My anxiety is not severe but it does alter my personality when it's bad. I don't find that this rx helps me at all. I still have my anxiety ticks, chest pain and Shortnes Of Breath (SOB).  Did this rx have a dehydrating effect on anyone else? I will try to take this at different times during the day to see if that helps.",0,22

Hydroxyzine,Have taken this off and on for a couple of months and had adverse reactions to it (just 25 mg) .  Now that have anxiety I'm trying 10 mg and it is making me really tired during the day.  The first night I took it around 2:00am so I thought that is why I'm tired but last night I took it around 9:00 and it kept me awake then kinda in dream state the rest of the night.

Hydroxyzine,"I take this drug as needed along with an anti depressant and anti anxiety medicine. I am prescribed 50 mg of hydroxyzine. If I feel a panic attack coming or I am feeling very anxious, I take this drug. It does its job for me. However it does take a long time to fully kick in. On rare occasions I would have to take 2 pills. Sometimes that doesnt work so I would have to take a klonopin but like I said that is rare. Generally I just take one and wait for it to kick in however I dont love the side effects. It causes me to feel irritable. I get a very dry mouth and after I wake up from sleeping I feel dehydrated. Also this medication causes a ferocious appetite for me. It makes me binge eat. Luckily I do not take this everyday or else I would be enormous. I recommend this if you struggle with bad panic attacks or anxiety. It is a good replacement for benzos since they can be addicting. Some people need stronger, like sometimes I do. Everyone is different so it may not be for everyone.",7,17
Hydroxyzine,Okay so I have been taking 50mg every 6 hours for 4 days now. My panic attacks were horrible and honestly I didn't believe this would work for me. I will say that for the first 3 days I had a horrible headache. That's gone today. And I feel like a human being again finally. This medication is helping me so much. And not just with my anxiety but with my depression as well. I'm definitely a supporter now.,8,24

Took it later as prescribed and I got so foggy and anxious! Totally so disappointed!   I tried yesterday and today at work. I was so panicky and confused that I ended up on the floor today trying to do stretching and muscle relaxation. My face was bright red and my eyes were glassy. They thought I needed an ambulance.  I did my stretches etc and tried to go back to work but it was still the same. I finally said to myself I need relief! I took a benzo I still had from my last script and within 15 minutes, I felt some relief. I could think clearly and relaxed a bit.  I cant see me taking it again since it did nothing for me for my anxiety except for that first time.",1,10
Hydroxyzine,"Avoid hydroxyzine if you want to preserve your IQ. It's for very, very specific allergies and has absolutely no place in the treatment of anxiety.

Last night took it and today sweating palms and panic attack and mental fog all day. I think for me its causing panic attacks the following day and making me less productive at work.

I used to lay awake all night stressing about not being able to sleep, but now I can actually fall asleep and it has been a total game changer.  Originally was taking hydroxyzine in combination with trazadone (50 mg) to combat my insomnia, but this proved to be way too much medication for me. I would have intense nightmares and sleep paralysis, and extreme difficulty getting up in the morning.

I didnt realize it was the medication at first, I thought I just got really sick, yet nobody else in my household was ill. So it was strange (1 gets it, we all get it). So after the 6th day I thought maybe it was the medicine. It made me severely sick. I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital I could hardly eat even.

Hydroxyzine,hydroxyzine is the worst anxiety medication ever. Made me stay up all night and caused my legs to feel tingly numb and extremely restless (feels like Im kicking). The following day I feel so weak and in pain. Its making my anxiety worse. So disappointing. I have taken benzos Im the past and they worked wonders. I have a new doctor and he will not prescribe. Sadly this is the second medication that he has given me that caused a serious negative effect.  I am bipolar two with severe anxiety disorder also on lamital,2,11
Hydroxyzine,"Hydroxyzine is a strong antihistamine and it will only be useful for immediate use. My anxiety gives me insomnia so this helped with both that and panic attacks. Yes, at first it will knock you out so I recommend taking it before bed for a week or so to get your body used to it. If you're like me and get groggy after taking sleeping medicine the night before, make sure you're leaving yourself enough time in the morning to get ready for work if you have to. Eventually the tiredness feeling won't overpower you. I'm ranking it at 7/10 because since I taking it pretty much daily to help me sleep I've noticed an increase in nightmares. I never usually dream so the fact that 5 out or 7 nights a week are nightmares is strange and I believe it could be partly due to the hydroxyzine.

This stuff calms everything right down, but in tiny doses it's still effective without leaving you on the couch all day like that first 50 mg dose did for me.

Im a bodybuilder and run quite a lot, but I only take the medication afterward. I would not recommend long-term use, but Ive been going on 5 years and it is still astoundingly effective when I start panicking and getting irritable. I usually just take it a couple hours before sleeping or earlier if Im panicking. So, effective as hell, but floors you, but you will not be dysfunctional or overly foggy. Its effectiveness is actually on par with Xanax, but there is no euphoria or risk for addiction, which is common in anxiety patients.",0,44

Thank God I didn't take the whole 25mg . Idk what would've happened to me . It did help my racing thoughts but nothing the nervousness and knots in my stomach but I will keep trying as small amount then maybe build myself up .

Also, whenever I feel an attack coming on at work I take it and it kicks in within minutes. I have tried 4 other anxiety meds that didn't work it made me worse, I'm so relieved and happy I found this. Good luck and hang in there :)",10,26

Hydroxyzine,"After taking many medications for years (starting with being medicated for social anxiety which kept me out of high school - and now I'm 36) that didn't work or had awful side effects, I didn't think anything would work to the extent I wanted. Then my psychiatrist retired a few months ago. I had been on lorazepam for anxiety. The psychiatrist that replaced him saw that what I was taking really wasn't as effective as it should be. She asked me, When you are anxious, do you get the physical symptoms like a racing heart, or do you cry and get fretful? I told her that I cry and get fretful and overwhelmed. She said, Let's get this anxiety under control. She prescribed me hydroxyzine and cut back my lorazepam. Hydroxyzine is heads and shoulders above anything I've ever taken before for my anxiety. Giving it a 9 out of 10. Everyone's different, but maybe, if you're reading this, looking for answers, hydroxyzine could help you too.",9,54

Hydroxyzine,Clonazepam works best (Benzodiazepine); I tried 25 mg of Hydroxyzine for my violent panic attack and it does absolutely nothing. If you have no panic attack then it's effective for sedation.,4,11

I've been on it for 3 days after having  it for 2 weeks and fighting  with myself about taking it. Take it. We are all different but it's worth a try.  It  saved my life and let me add when we feel this way we are seeking answers to our anxiety  which causes us to desperately find relief by reading something we wanna hear or whatever it takes. This is the hardest thing I've dealt with in my life but don't give up there is hope with this med and Citalopram and lots of exercise and prayer!!! Another thing guys this is how many reviews out of billions of people so don't lose hope. Best of luck Hugs and prayers!!!,10,77

I laid down for a very deep three hour nap and woke up with my whole body in pain and I was still tired. Now it is 26 hours later and my entire body still aches, especially my feet but the upside is that the swelling of my face and hives on my puffy eyelids is going away.

Now that I am on hydroxyzine 20mg before bed, I can rest much better and feel relaxed throughout the day even when I get intrusive thoughts.

Have high blood pressure and diabetic and I can tell I'm getting a bad reaction. Now my insomnia is back. I'll stop it completely because it's not helping me. Dr originally prescribed 10 mg 3 times daily. I'd be passed out on the floor if I took that much. Very bad for me.",1,5

I am on lithium &amp; was taking Lexapro to help with the additional anxiety/depression I was having and it caused hair loss and I couldn't stay awake or focus. I stopped it and my psych prescribed the Vistaril because I can take it as needed. I don't feel sedated, I feel relaxed. It helps with the depression purely because it eases my anxiety. This morning I had an anxiety attack and even though the Vistaril kicked in when it was over, it helped me handle the residual feelings I was having and I was able to turn my day around and make it a good one.

Hydroxyzine,I was given hydroxyzine 25 mg three times a day to help reduce my need of as many benzos. To say it's useless is false.

While they seemed to help my anxiety because I was either asleep or almost paralyzed in bed, so I couldn't function and was agitated because of how they made me feel. So,I stopped taking them and it's almost a year later. Weather has just recently got warmer where I'm at and I'm short of breath again and anxious again and panicking again!

I would take maybe a 1/2 - 1/4 of a pill (they would knock me out so would I take the KV Tech before bed) and alternate days Zyrtec with and would relieve my condition for about 4-6  months. Needless to say a bottle of 30 would last quite a while. A few days ago I called in a refill of the same KV Tech 25mg. This bottle doesn't do anything. Doesn't stop the itching or put me to sleep. Normally would knock me out and very deep sleep. Nothing ! I wonder if somebody is making these pills on the black market and distributing them. I had this filled at a national brand pharmacy.

Hydroxyzine,"People writing here are not happy, either, and we need to be proactive with our doctors. This did NOT help, my nightmares were vivid and no patient should settle for that as a way to be rid of an Rx that could actually work for me so I am not anxious, and can have a good life.  I also was concerned my bp was up; never had it before; felt like my heart was racing, went to a cardiologist I trust, and was ok though blood pressure was causing it to feel like racing. It's obviously the meds. I also took Trazadone for sleep/anxiety, had horrific nightmares, no warning on either med., both Rx's caused a hangover effect and was tired all day. Not happy w/ medical care lately; missing  doctors caring about us first. Maybe having &amp; taking more time with patients, listening, solving &amp; providing real needs would reduce our opioid situation in the U. S. : it's the worst healthcare system in the world.",1,7

Heart was racing my head felt so groggy. Woke up this morning and still feel out of it. Didn't take it at 2 like I was supposed to so let's see what happens.

(I also have agoraphobia) every now and then they will make me just a little drowsy but never anything that inhibits my control or focus. I have also benefited from hydroxyzine for allergies as well. it really is a wonderful thing, especially because it is not habit forming and you do not build a tolerance to it. I have used 25mg for about 2 years (as needed) and it still is just as effective as day 1.

This drug is a lifesaver for me, it really helps with my anxiety and knocks my cravings out and it doesnt make me sleepy. I take 25 mg 3 times a day and it helps tremendously. And if I dont need it, I dont take it. Its not addictive so if I do miss a dose I dont have withdrawals, I dont even notice. I highly recommend people take this if you have anxiety.

It really only makes me thirsty, but drinking water is good for you anyway!!",10,10
Hydroxyzine,<b>Vistaril (hydroxyzine):</b>			 I have had anxiety and a panic disorder for most of my adult life. I was on ativan for 15 years and have been on klonopin for 10. When my doctor retires or I lose health insurance coverage I have been prescribed vistaril by family practice doctors that don't like prescribing benzodiazepines. For me it does stop panic attacks and calms me. Also helps with sleeping. The only downside is it is less effective over time unlike klonopin or ativan which never loses its efficacy. It's a nice med to take short term until I find a long term doctor.,0,25
Hydroxyzine,"<b>Vistaril (hydroxyzine):</b>			 I was prescribed Vistaril to help with anxiety and sleep following opiate withdrawals. It did little, if anything. Original dose was 50 mg, later raised to 100 mg. It did reduce the crazy sneezing I went through. I got far better results for sleep from OTC Benedryl and melatonin.",0,6
Hydroxyzine,I take this medication 3 times a day and I actually like it. Its really helping the only thing I dont like is I get really tired and dizzy on them but overall its pretty effective.,9,6
Hydroxyzine,This pill made it hard to wake up the next day. I only take this when I desperately need to. It works and makes my thoughts seem to quiet and slow down within minutes. The side effects are barely bareable. It may knock you out and make you feel groggy.,5,9

I take it for chronic hives, and have done so for 45 years.",0,31
Hydroxyzine,"Prescribed to help me discontinue opiates, mainly for anxiety. In general, Ive not had any results Id say were helpful. Nothing harmful, but it hasnt helped much with anxiety.

It causes my heart to race a bit for an hour after taking it. No other effects, good or bad though.",4,7
Hydroxyzine,"So my doctor prescribed me hydroxyzine pamoate because I told her I was having episodes of terrible anxiety and I wasn't sleeping very well because of it. The first night I took it, it took about 30 mins to set in, I started feeling calm and my normal negative obsessive thoughts became more positive and far less obsessive. I would have a positive thought and move on to another. That in itself was amazing and I also slept very well. The dry mouth side effect is bearable as well. However, the next morning when I woke up I was so groggy and could feel the sedation had not worn off... All I wanted to do was sleep and not talk because I was so relaxed and I was extremely irritable",5,11

Hydroxyzine,"I took Hydroxyzine last night for the first time. It worked quite well for me, it helped me fall asleep and the next day I felt calm and relaxed. I suffer from panic disorder, insomnia and bi polar. The only side effect I experienced was vivid dreams/nightmares but nothing I couldn't handle since I've always had bad dreams, but it could have been from something else because before taking this medication I would experience them anyways so I can't say that it was entirely due from taking the Hydroxyzine. Maybe it enhanced it but I'm not sure so don't take my word for it. I know it won't take the anxiety away immediately or cure it like Xanax or Ativan would but I believe with continued use it could definitely help! Good luck!",0,7

The anxiety and panic are linked to my depression, which altogether led to me being hospitalized. When I was there, they prescribed lexapro for my depression and hydroxyzine for my anxiety. The hydroxyzine meds took me out like a light, I could not stay awake to save my life. And when I was awake, I was completely out of it. After a few months of using it and getting used to it these side effects stopped, however it was hell waiting for them to stop. I would not recommend to anyone working, as I was at the time, but if you're willing to wait out the period of absent-mindedness, it can help calm you down.",4,15

No more tightness of chest, short breaths, chest pain, and no more feeling like I'm coming undone. When I feel like I may be on the verge of an anxiety attack, I take a pill and I feel like new.

Mind stop racing and negative thoughts seem to push to the back and not to the front as usual.  They make me feel mellow and laid back..Mind you. I'm not a drug user of any type so that's probably why they work so well for me. I keep them with me all the time. They don't make me drowsy. However, if I'm relaxed. I can definitely dose off.

I seemed to have a slight amount of anxiety relief, but also an increase.

Vistaril however I have 0 regrets because it's less likey to cause even a mental addiction, let alone a physical one! Its been very helpful for me but do keep in mind that everyone reacts differently than others! I find it very helpful for me!",10,28

Because of all the Abuse of these meds though by people that don't need it for anything except to get high makes me furious!!! Because where I live in N.J.,no kind of doctor wants to prescribe any kind of benzo anymore. It's awful because these meds help so many people.

At first since I only thought it was Insomnia, the Ambien I got prescribed didn't work. I was going on 5 days with ONLY an hour of sleep so I visited a Psych. Vistaril worked that night and ever since. At first I took it as needed (2-3/day), then after a couple weeks I was just doing 1 at night for sleep. Crazy dreams similar to Benadryl.  I ran out 3 weeks ago and wanted to see how I would fare. Not good. Just got it prescribed again and looking to jump back into a proper sleep cycle and keep it as a safety stash.

My dosage was lowered to 10mg and although I didn't have the major day after drowsiness it still helped me sleep.  I took it during the day and it felt like I took several Benadryl's and I was unable to function for the afternoon because I was so drowsy.  Good thing I was at home when I took it.

Hydroxyzine,"Meh. In the past, I'd very occasionally taken valium and mostly klonopin for panic attacks and night terrors. My prescriber switched me due to the addictive nature of benzos, as well as their tendency to increase the likelihood of age-related cognitive impairments like Alzheimer's and dementia. I'm not thrilled with the results. I take 25mg of hydroxyzine maybe a few times a month. Where the klonopin had a very clear and palpable effect in reducing my anxiety, I still question whether the new medication is doing anything at all.

Hydroxyzine,I take Hydeoxzine HCLfor anxiety. I have to take a higher dose for it to work (100mg 3x a day). I have severe anxiety to the point it makes me vomit and I end up having a panic attack. I can't take a benzo as I have a addictive personality. The Hydroxyzine does work for me somewhat in the sense that it makes me kinda numb. I get super calm and relaxed. If your psychiatrist/doctor suggest that you take it for anxiety or something like that make sure you get the Hydroxyzine HCL brand and not the Hydroxyzine Pamoate. There is a big difference or that's what my doctor told me anyways. The HCL brand is more for anxiety and the Pamoate brand is more for allergies and things like that.,8,39

Hydroxyzine,"I take 100mg as a PRN for extreme anxiety/panic attacks. It works almost as well as Ativan but without the unfortunate inevitability of building up a tolerance that happens with taking benzos.The only downside is that my insurance doesn't cover it while it does cover Ativan, otherwise I would just switch over completely. The sensation is a bit different than using benzos to stop a panic attack. Where Ativan will work very quickly in 20-30 minutes tops and smother and separate you from the sensation of panic in your chest, with hydroxyzine it takes about 45 minutes and the way the anxiety slowly petering-out sort of creeps up on you. You have to be more patient which can be awful when you're panicking but the end result is nearly identical.",8,32

Hydroxyzine,I've been taking this medication for almost a month along with gabapentin and mirtazepine I use gabapentin during the day in very large amounts. Being a benzo user the gaba doesn't help my panic attacks unless a big dose is taken at a time. I tried to combine gaba and hydroxyzine with very little effect on my anxiety.  Now at night I try taking it alone and nothing but with the mirtazepine I do fall asleep but have the scariest most real feeling frightening nightmares ever. The doc is trying to get me to stop taking clonazepam but that is the only benzo that works for my anxiety all day and eases me to sleep at night without crazy nightmares.

I chose to start taking Visitril since the lexapro wasn't effective in ways I wanted and now on 50mg to 100 mg a day, I can say that it is easier to be focused on things that I really care about and I can usually notice the subtle change in my body when it stops working (in my stomach primarily) and I'll pop another one and will stay pretty level as long as it is in my system.",0,61

I've taken benzos for years, but I'm not a fan due to tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The only downside of hydroxyzine so far is this odd anxiety when falling asleep. I will wake myself up due to not feeling myself breathe. This can go on for an hour +. I'm hoping that will fade off and I can just enjoy the benefits of this medication.",9,29
Hydroxyzine,"It does relieve anxiety associated with severe panic. I have GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and under duress, I suffer from heart palpitations, dizziness, dermatitis, and nausea.

Hydroxyzine,I was prescribed hydroxyzine as an anti nausea med  for after surgery. I quickly noticed how it calmed me down. Post surgery bathing was especially anxiety inducing for me. I would take one before getting in so I could handle it. It also was the only way I could sleep otherwise I would be up after a couple hours due to inactivity (surgery was from a sports injury).  I decided to get another prescription for it as an anxiety medication after having an anxiety attack. I took one to calm down and within minutes my panic was under control.

Hydroxyzine,"I've had severe anxiety since 9 but after 25 years, I painfully learned to cope with it and reduce it without meds (most of this was from the fact that I was never properly diagnosed when I was a child). Some of that anxiety won't ever go away but I prefer not to take benzos unless I really need them. The very serious problem with benzos is that they can be very dangerous if you quit taking them and they are habit forming and you will unfortunately and quickly grow a tolerance to them over time.

The first night taking this drug it took about an hour for any sedative effect to kick in and shortly after I went to bed.

Thanks to my  doctor  I have regular episodes of vertigo which I had never experienced in my life. Stay away from this drug !,0,47
Hydroxyzine,"Definitely helps me sleep through the panic/anxiety/insomnia at night, my side effects were quite severe -  daytime fatigue, irritability, dry mouth and rapidly deteriorating vision (blurred). As a very short-term aid, this drug was great, but after 3 months, I'm ready to go drug-free and see how I feel.",4,17
Hydroxyzine,I was to told to take 50mg every 6 hours for Anxiety. My anxiety is very extreme. This drug does nothing for me. I am also taking 30mg of Remeron at night.,1,13

Hydroxyzine,"This works well for me while not coupled with any other substances. I took it about a decade ago with Paxil and did not notice any benefiial affects because I was so sedated and out of it from the Paxil but now I am taking it without any other substances and I notice a very beneficial affect. Only downside is it makes you pretty tired. I have been combatting the feeling w/caffeine, which works for me but may not work for everyone... have sleep panic attacks and night terrors and this is the only thing that's made me sleep soundly in as long as I can remember.",9,19
Hydroxyzine,"This is very good for first time anxiety. It makes you feel drowsy which helps to calm you. Excessive tiredness was the only real side effect I had. However, this may not work for everyone because it does not treat the psychological aspect of anxiety. So even if it makes you tired, you may still feel very anxious. It makes for good short term treatment, but I would talk to a doctor for something else for long term control. On the whole it has helped me very much because I can take it as needed, it's not habit forming, and it's pretty inexpensive. I am happy with the way it has helped me.",8,29
Hydroxyzine,"I take it 3 times a day and it has worked like magic. Almost all my panic attacks have gone away, and just most of my anxiety in general. My only complaint is that i have trouble staying awake in class and at home, but that's probably because I'm also on a couple of other anxiety meds too. Overall, this med has helped me tremendously and I'm really glad i found something that worked",8,33

Hydroxyzine,"I'm 20 yrs old and Ive been taking this drug for about a month now. I am supposed to take this whenever I have a panic attack but I usually take 1 25mg before bed to calm me down sometimes. It really helps when I'm so anxious that I can't fall asleep. Although I think I might need a higher dose soon. my only complaint is the dry mouth and after waking up you feel really drowsy and you almost have a light feeling (not high, its different). Overall I would recommend taking this in the evening if you just need to calm down a bit to sleep.",8,18
Hydroxyzine,"Got the prescription of the hydroxyzine 25mgs on a Friday.  Picked up my prescription on my way to work.  I took 1 pill.  I felt great and energetic before I took the pill and probably about 30-50 min., I was in sleep mode.  On Saturday, I took a pill in the morning...  just to see if it was really the new meds that caused me to feel this way.  Yes, same thing happened to me.... I developed extreme dry mouth, extremely tired ( worse than a hangover).  All I wanted to do is go lay in my bed and sleep.  I stopped taking this medication.  I had to work on Sunday evening.  This pill would not get out of my system.  I drank 2 cups of coffee, chugged water...  couldn't get the zombie/sleepy feeling out of my body.  BAD BAD MEDICINE!",1,25

Hydroxyzine,Here's what I have gathered so far. My quick background: doctor prescribed visatril and 20mg prozac. * I take 50mg every 4 hours * I have really bad hand tremors but I always have a slightly shaky hand so it doesn't bother me too much. * I also get sensitive hands because I can't stop squeezing my hands together and rubbing on it. * super dry mouth/constant thirst * easier time singing * I take 2 to sleep Along with other symptoms. But honestly being able to get out of bed and be able to say hi to my husband and greet teachers at my kids school without wanting to die is well worth the side effects. Although I think the side effects are just my body getting to do what it wants to do without my anxiety trying to suppress it,10,27

Hydroxyzine,"I suffer from extreme panic attacks when being alone and I feel that all this medication did was make me extremely drowsy. The first two days I took this medication, all I could do and wanted to do was lie around. I had no motivation to do much and I felt on edge.

Hydroxyzine,"I was recently diagnosed with anxiety, like 1 month ago. I really thought I was going to die, anxiety was the worst thing that ever happened to me, it frustrated me to hear the doctors say just deep breath your not going to die, like they truly didn't understand the feeling, anxiety is the worst feeling ever, I cried 3 days straight constantly feeling like the air was being taken from me and just depressed it was hard to describe the amount of emotions I felt. My doctor prescribed this medication and to be honest it's the best thing that ever happened to me. From now and then I can feel my chest tightening but never as severe. I just want to let those who feel helpless know if I got through it you can to be strong you can do it",8,105

The first few nights it worked amazingly but it was difficult to wake up but then I'd be very alert and awake all day.

While on hydroxyzine I thought I was going insane.

The down side is if i go into a severe panic attack it does nothing for me. I had to go to court so i took six 50mg (every 2 hours) it had no effect because i hate standing in front of people, i was still panicking. Where i live (and probably most places now) people take advantage of benzodiazepine and other drugs so no doctor will prescribe them to me. I am the exact person that needs them and i will not take advantage.

I have been a lot less irritable, I've had less muscle tension and plainly more functional day to day. I definitely still have a good bit of anxiety but this has made a noticable difference. I have had no side effects at all which is a miracle since I usually get every single side effect to every med I take. Hoping to move up a dose soon to see if that helps. Love this medicine.",10,38

The interactions with people in my dreams were insanely vivid. This is not the first time, but the dreams have never been this wild! Tired, but scared to go back to sleep. Oh, it does help with slowing down the body and relaxing muscle, but it seems to wear off as quickly as it sets on.",3,23

Hydroxyzine,"Due to family illnesses, family addictions and marital problems I had been having severe anxiety and panic attacks that seemed to be getting worse and I was having difficulty sleeping at night. I was prescribed 50mg Hydroxyzine up to 3 times a day as needed for anxiety. After about 10 mins of taking my first dose it was as if someone snapped there fingers and the weight of the world was finally lifted off my chest and I could breath. This really helped melt away my anxiety. I didn't feel numb or drugged but I felt relaxed. It was like a heavy, and grounded feeling.

Then by mouth they put me on phenobarbital. Anyhow, the hydroxyzine did nothing for me personally. I never abused my klonopins or urgeso many people dying by taking handfuls of them is making it hard to find a psychiatrist who should know not all people on klonopin,xanax, etc.  have anxiety they taste it for a buzz or to sell.

It was prescribed to me to take the place of Xanax and to help me sleep. I was prescribed 25mg to take 1-2 twice daily as needed.

It didn't do anything for my anxiety or panic. I took it when I started having a panic attack and I felt as though I was having an attack while encased in jello.

I was having a little issues breathing and I was seriously considering going to the ER. If you have bad anxiety I would not recommend this drug. I did however pass out after 3 hours and I had the coolest dream! I just woke up after about 3 hours of sleep, even though the purpose was to keep me asleep.

That being said, hydroxyzine is pretty much exactly what I've been looking for. It takes care of my anxiety when it's worse than usual but not nearly intense enough for me to feel justified in using a benzodiazepine while only causing a minor degree of cognitive impairment.

(I caution you readers to be leery of reviews by those who prior took addictive medications to Vistaril, as they may have formed a biased addiction to their previous meds.)   I am currently taking Prozac and Vistaril. My best medication combination when not pregnant or breast feeding was Prozac and Doxepin. The Vistaril is helping so greatly with both my anxiety and insomnia that I am switching permanently! I can even take Vistaril if my anxiety flares, plus it is not addictive! Loving it!!!",0,117
Hydroxyzine,"I am very pleased with Hydroxyzine. It is non-addictive &amp; it always helps with my panic attacks &amp; anxiety. It doesn't always get rid my anxiety completely, but it definitely takes the edge off of it, which is enough to help me function. The only side effect I sometimes get is dry mouth, so make sure to drink plenty of water if that happens to you. Biotene mouthwash also helps with that. Hydroxyzine can make you sleepy, so don't try to drive or do anything productive, until you see how it affects you.",9,29
Hydroxyzine,"I just took this for the first time about 2 hours ago. I read a lot of the reviews on this site before starting to take it and saw a lot of negative posts on the pill and on its effects. Going into it, I didn't expect it to cure or completely rid me of anxiety like I feel like a lot of other reviewers on here did, which lead to their negative takes on it. I more so just wanted to see how I would respond. I found that it took about an hour (maybe a little less) to kick in. I also found that it calmed me down quite a lot. I only took a 25mg capsule. I've seen a lot of reviewers saying that it sedated them. I didn't feel deadly tired, just nice and calm. First time all day not feeling anxiety. So I give this one a thumbs up.",8,61

This stuff takes almost an hour to kick in, but when it does, it almost always kills my anxiety at times when benzos didn't.  If you're gonna take it for sleep, take it at least an hour before you plan on going to bed and make sure you have 8 to 9 hours to sleep because it will knock you out.  Grogginess is it's biggest negative, along with tolerance building up fast, so I try to take every other day if I can, though it's non-addictive and safe to take regularly at least far safer than a benzo.",0,69

This is a drug similar to Benadryl, but a bit stronger. It is nonaddictive, and DOES fight the anxiety without the side effects of Ativan/Xanax. This WILL NOT kill the anxiety alone. You must be on an SSRI such as Lexapro for this drug to fully combat GAD. I urge everyone to try this drug. There are no risks, and it may help you.",0,91

Hydroxyzine,"After experiencing crippling anxiety and panic attacks, I took a leave of absence from and eventually lost my six figure lucrative job in Boston. I went into a residential treatment center for 2 months. I did a 7 week trial of Celexa and Paxil. Both made me severely more anxious, agitated, jittery and gained 20 pounds. I felt completely hopeless. At the center, they also introduced me to Vistaril. It was the ONLY thing that worked (besides Ativan, which is addictive). At one point I was up to 75mg/day and noticed my resting pulse was consistently 25-30bpm higher than usual. My diastolic BP also consistently was 10 higher. I lowered my dose to only 12.5mg/day and pulse and BP went back to normal and still worked well. It won't help depression though",8,29

I became extremely irritable (probably from the increased anxiety not being treated with xanax anymore).  I did not notice any positive effects even after taking it for a month.  I was told this medication was fast acting for panic attacks like xanax, but they did not help with the panic attacks in the least bit.  I highly recommend that if you have severe debilitating anxiety to not even try this drug based on what I went through.",0,57

Finally a nurse gave me a sample of this medication.  It was a miracle drug.  After a month anxiety-free I was able to stop taking it and now feel great.

Not only do I sleep amazingly every night I feel relaxed enough to get through my day now! On top of that my allergies are now nonexistent and I've been able to refrain from smoking and drinking much more easily because of it.

Hydroxyzine,"<b>Vistaril (hydroxyzine):</b>			 Of the non-benzodiazepeine anti-anxiety agents, Vistaril is my first choice.

Although Vistaril is gentle &amp; easy going for the first hour or so, a strong drowsiness will come on by Hour #2.

It does make me a little tired, but not messed up and groggy like Xanax or Ativan. I don't care for benzodiazapines, so this is what I have to work with.

Hydroxyzine,<b>Vistaril (hydroxyzine):</b>			 I've been taking Vistaril 25 mg for 3 weeks and it has not helped me what so ever. At first I felt a little less nervous but when I had to go to an assembly it kicked right back up! Now I'm getting ready to get on Lexapro. Hopefully this drug works for me.,0,17
Hydroxyzine,"This is a great medicine for my bipolar child, for anxiety.  I asked my own doctor for some when I found Ativan too sedating for daytime anxiety. I found it works even better when it came to muscle tension and racing thoughts than any other anti-anxiety medicine I've taken.",10,35

It is not addicting... and good price for the good things the meds do.,0,218
Lexapro,"I took Lexapro 2 times over my 21 years of life.  1. 13 y.o. HORRIBLE panic attacks, despersonalization, couldn't breathe, couldn't walk and thinking I'm going to die. Started to take Lexapro. No side effects and it helped me a lot. Took it for 1 year and I started to change my lifestyle to have little to none stress. 2. 19 y.o. Stress came back and so did the anxiety. No panic attacks tho. Begun to take the med, started to enjoy things again. Had side effects this time. Gained 30 pounds over 8 months! Had EXTREME loss of libido. After one year and a half, I really can't say it did more good than bad this last time. I've been off it for 2 months now. I have insomnia and struggle to lose weight. I'm eating healthy on a C.D, exercising 6/w and yet I hardly lose any weight. I still have really dark thoughts when I go to sleep and overthinking are still there.  So I have mixed thoughts about this medication. First time it helped, years later it came back and it did little to nothing.",7,7
Lexapro,Lexapro changed my life for the better.  My severe depression and anxiety are under control and don't bother me now. The first week was hard but the benefits have been absolutely incredible for me.,10,17
Lexapro,"I was unsure whether or not this medication Lexapro was working because I was still having bad days and anxiety daily however I let myself run out somehow and ended up being off them for a week, oh boy did I notice it. I was having outbursts that I hadnt had to that severity in months. I think my dosage potentially needs tweaking but I am doing so much better on this than I was on mirtazapine or fluoxetine. My side effects were minimal - nausea on and off and some insomnia",8,6
Lexapro,"So Ive been on this Lexapro for almost a couple months and Ive been trying to stick it out and see where it gets me I started taking whole pills which was and is terrible the side effects suck so I started taking a half in the morning and a half at evening time I felt like I was finally getting somewhere and my moods were getting better but I keep having what seems like more attacks and for a few days now Ive just been not myself, dizzy, brain fog, frequent urination, fatigue &amp; its so hard to get out of bed in the mornings even when I get plenty of sleep And my sex drive has drastically went down to almost nothing and its horrible to where I would rather just deal with attacks and take a Xanax everyday rather than deal with the side effects of this medication. Will be calling my doctor and weaning off it. I want my life back. For all of you that it has worked for Im happy it worked for you unfortunately everyones bodies dont take things as well as others.",2,13
Lexapro,About 3 weeks in. I was on Sertraline for months prior. I maxed out on it. I was given a second med to go with the Lexapro the other day. I have anxiety and PTSD issues it seems. I still have issues but am working through them. The meds do help but my night sweats are still prevalent nightly.,8,11
Lexapro,"I had issues with random fainting and severe vertigo. Drs couldn't find anything wrong and my anxiety was intense from these which led them to believe it must be panic attacks. First week low dose felt really messed up but I was encouraged to keep it up.  Then one day I suddenly dropped into paralysis and felt a fear I that I didn't know I was capable of feeling. I've been bad before many times and never felt this kind of fear. It felt like my organs were shutting down. I couldn't scream. I couldn't breathe. I was deaf and blind, while sweat poured off me. Everything was paralyzed.     It lasted a few minutes and I hyperventilated when it finally stopped as I had been unable to breathe that whole time.  The Dr told me it was a panic attack and to keep taking them. I said I couldn't and he said it's just a placebo anyways. He didn't believe my reaction and became angry with me. Because of this I now have a huge fear of SSRIs and distrust in the medical system.",1,43
Lexapro,"Lexapro saved my life. Prior to starting the medication, my anxiety was severe. I couldn't leave the house and get into a car without a full blown panic attack-- sobbing, nausea, the works. Therapy wasn't cutting it, and neither was meditation or any of the suggestions people threw at me.  The first week of Lexapro, the nausea was very intense. But I could feel it changing my brain, and it was such a weird yet hopeful feeling.  For three years, I had my life back. I was able to travel and enjoy taking risks without crippling anxiety. At the three year mark, my Lexapro stopped working. I haven't found a resolution yet, but I hope I can find another alternative that will help me feel the way I have these past few years.",9,83
Lexapro,"I started on  Lexapro in November on 10 mg dose. Then January  moved up to 15mg, and I am now  at 20mg dose. I feel and always felt horrid.  Diarrhea and achy and nausea. The docs say each time that I increase the dose I should give it time  and that the side effects will get better. I dont know what to do. Help me  anyone have these side effects and do they go away.",0,34
Lexapro,Lexapro just did not work for me. Took it for three years and it did nothing to help my anxiety and depression - I  still had anxiety attacks and I got angry to the point of breaking things. I cried a lot. Had diarrhea a lot too. Finally switched to Effexor and its been 100 times better. Everyones bodies react differently but lexapro just wasnt for me.,1,22
Lexapro,Been on lexepro for 6 weeks now no side effects but a little bit of a runny nose otherwise nothing been noticing a little bit of relief from anxiety slowly but surely can't wait for week 8 but otherwise it's been good,8,23
Lexapro,When I first started Lexapro the only side effect I had was twitching very badly. Went away after like 2 weeks. It didn't help at all. I don't take it any more cause I felt it made me worse. When I wouldn't take it for like 3 days I had TERRIBLE TERRIBLE withdrawals. Obviously you're not supposed to miss days. I've been off it for about 2 months now. I have problems I never had before taking lexapro. Everyday I got electric shocks through out my body and if I move my eyes to fast I get the shocks. I don't think I'll ever be the same before taking lexapro.,2,35
Lexapro,"Since I have been on lexipro I can feel a significant change in how I react to my anxiety, my habits, and how it has helped with my digestion and IBS (super happy with this random bonus!).  The easiest way for me to explain my overall state on lexipro is that when I feel my anxiety rising, I am more aware of it and am able to pull myself out of a spiral. For me, that is the best part.  Because of the lessened anxiety, I also have fewer IBS flare ups.",10,46
Lexapro,"I have been dealing with anxiety my whole life but have tried to go the natural route but nothing ever worked. It was affecting my marriage the way I was with my kids and work. So I finally did something about it and Im so glad I did! My Dr. prescribed my Lexapro 10mg. The first week I had slight nausea, diarrhea and no appetite but I did start feeling more calm. Lexapro helped me so much. I could drive without feeling anxious, go to work events with confidence. I was better with handling situations at work and at home. Unfortunately the downside for me was I ended up gaining 15lbs within 5 months. It definitely slowed down my metabolism. It was easy to gain and no matter how much healthier I tried to eat I could not lose the weight. I have been slender my whole life so this was making me feel so depressed about the way I looked. So sadly I had to stop taking it. I highly recommend Lexapro I just happened to be that 10% side effect that it could cause weight gain.",8,39
Lexapro,"Hi, Ive been on 10mg of Lexapro for 3+ weeks and still having side effects or anxiety attacks.  Shaking hands, burning feet and mouth.  Seems to get worse 2 hoiurs after I take a dose.  Did anyone have these issues and when oh when does it start to go away ? Thanks !!",5,51
Lexapro,"I was prescribed Lexapro after my constant, full body shaking and dizziness had no reasonable cause and I have a family history of anxiety. The first week is absolutely the worst. I couldn't eat, sleep, shaking got way worse, felt like passing out, dizzy, restless legs, unable to concentrate. Be warned, you need to take a week off work before starting this stuff. After a week a lot of the problems went away. I had a day without any shaking in my body or dizziness, then it came back, then went away again. It will work eventually, just stick with it.",7,50
Lexapro,"This medication Lexapro has been pretty good to me. I had diarrhea and fatigue for the first few days, but that went away. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2, GAD, and Agoraphobia. I thought that nothing could ever fix my anxiety, but this has done wonders. It's almost miraculous. My anxiety is 90% gone! It has allowed me to start living my life. The only thing this could use some work on is helping my depressive episodes. But paired with Abilify, I'm doing a lot better than before.",9,30
Lexapro,"My husband started 5mg of Lexapro about 8 weeks ago. He has anxiety, panic attacks and some OCD tendencies. He had side effects at first, slightly increased panic attacks and anxiety. Started feeling better though after the first week. Not as good as he wanted so he went to 10mg and had a relapse of side effects but to me the panic attack seemed slightly less severe and passed quickly. It has been a month on the 20mg and he has had several bad panic attacks and some increased anxiety. We were really worried about this but then did some more reading and it seems that it was common for people to have this happen after a month but it passed. I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this happen after a month of starting and if they continued. Did it get better and how long until it passed.",8,33
Lexapro,"Anxiety was so much better immediately but my teeth started to hurt, broken blood vessel in my finger,  my shoulders and down my arm had severe pain, my hip was severe pain,  I guess my joints were hurting terrible everyday getting more pain so I had to stop taking lexapro. I took lexapro maybe 15 years ago and didn't have this problem,l exapro the brand cost $100.00 so I chose the generic so maybe thats why its so different for me this time",3,16
Lexapro,"Well, I got prescribed this because Im a self proclaimed hypochondriac and I'm constantly in fear of having a serious illness. Also I had been hospitalized for severe panic attacks. I just took my first dose today (10mg) with food. As soon as I took the pill I got mildly nauseous and had to lay down. About 3 hours later I felt sooo nice kind of like I was high just an overall good feeling and a little drowsiness Then a couple hours later the nausea returned but with a horrible headache almost felt like I had the flu and made me check my temperature (no fever). Now Im laying in bad unable to sleep because I feel sick and I have muscle twitches. Hope this wears off or else Im going to stop it immediately.",5,22
Lexapro,"I started on this drug on my doctor's advice to ease the anxiety that was occurring from taking blood pressure medication. I wish I would have found it year's earlier, even before the blood pressure medication highlighted my anxiety. It took about 2 weeks to start kicking in. It negates anxiety and enables me to deal with what is in front of me far better. Plus, silly or repetitive, negative thought loops cease and I get over things that upset me way faster and easier. The only negative for me is that I know I am on something. The positives far outweigh this negative and my doctor says after about a year she will wean me off and hopefully my serotonin levels will remain at a higher level, so I don't have to be on it forever.",8,68
Lexapro,"Lexapro has saved me! I didnt want to take any medication, but heightened anxiety and a couple panic attacks made it difficult for me to enjoy life  so much that I was becoming depressed. The first week on Lexapro was awful! Increased anxiety, a clouded feeling, and tiredness! And at the end of week 2, I had a day of high anxiety. But Id read other reviews that encouraged me to push through! Im so glad I did! Im at week 4 on a dose of 5mg Lexapro and Ive had no more panic attacks and anxiety is greatly reduced/manageable. Im looking forward to how Ill feel in another 4 weeks! No side effects have remained after the initial week or two. I did find it made me sleepy taking it in the morning, so I just changed to taking it at night which solved that problem. Hang in there if youre just starting it and its rough. It will get better!",10,93
Lexapro,"Was diagnosed with anxiety recently and prescribed Lexapro. First few days felt weird, started getting headaches, brain fog, libido gone. These were common effects so I kept it going. I noticed my anxiety was gone, but I couldn't cry either. I was emotionally numb and had no empathy for others. 8 days in I started getting suicidal thoughts. Keep in mind I start this for anxiety and NOT depression/suicidal thoughts! I was very scared of myself as it felt like a second conscience was forming in my brain, one that'd tell me I'm worthless and ugly, and I'd argue with it with my normal conscience. 3 days into these new thoughts the more I was on it the more this depressive conscience took over, and I was forming ways on how to commit suicide. I was too scared to continue at this point so I stopped and my anxiety is back but I have not gotten suicidal thoughts since. And this was all only on 5mg. As said by my doctor, please halt using this drug immediately if you get suicidal thoughts.",3,25
Lexapro,"Life saver. First week  on Lexapro aint easy. I felt every single emotion within five minutes. All day long. But once you're through with that, life starts being bright again. I experienced few side effects, which are nothing compared to the anxiety I had. If youre just starting and you feel liken its getting worse, push through it, it gets better!",9,78
Lexapro,"I developed sleep anxiety, which is absolutley awful. After  experiencing insomnia I developed an anxiety at the thought of sleep. Even the approaching evening would trigger it. I felt hopeless. It led to depression and suicidal thoughts. I was put on lexapro a eventually went up to 15 mg. It helped me reclaim my life. It put my anxiety at bay so I could change my life. It took about 6 weeks for the drug to really start working along with minimal side effects. It has been a year and I am currently tapering off the medication because I feel I do not need it anymore. It is a good drug! Allow some time for it to kick in. Also, use the medication as a tool. Mental health is about balance. Find ways to change your life/ mentality. The Lexapro is a tool to help with the big picture. There is light on the other side of the storm! Never lose hope and FIGHT for your life!",10,122
Lexapro,"First day heart racing all day, I have a splitting headaches, by dosage 3 chest feels numb like, I have a dry mouth, dizziness but all these symptoms can be cause of anxiety.  By day four feel side effects less hopefully in two weeks will start working. 20 years ago I was on ciprimil for a few months ....felt similar",3,11
Lexapro,"The first couple of days on Lexapro were terrible and the first couple of weeks were rough.  I've been taking 10 mg now for almost a month.  After 3 weeks, it feels like my anxiety is 50% less.  You start noticing the positive effects w/in a few weeks.  Keep taking it - it's worth it.  Can't wait to see how I'll feel 6-8 weeks in. :)",10,47
Lexapro,"I switched to Lexapro from Zoloft, because the zoloft seemed like it was not working and making me gain weight. Lexapro is working much better for anxiety/depression. Also seems like it may easier to lose weight. Does not feel strange when I have a few drinks in moderation. Potential downsides- sometimes can feel apathetic/empty of emotions. Urge to eat (all SSRI's) Overall, would highly recommend especially for those with crippling anxiety.",8,33
Lexapro,"I have to say that the past few years my anxiety has been so awful and I tried CBT and Biofeedback with little success. I have always been anxious but when I had an episode of Afib it unleashed my anxiety to the point where it was making me afraid of everything. My MD put me on 10mg and within a week I felt so much better. I was really tired in the beginning but I am so grateful that I found this medication. Everyone is different, but for me no bad side effects and amazing relief.",10,47
Lexapro,"Saw GP because of now and again mild anxiety and mild depression.  Started with 10mg for week 1, then upped to 20mg (appears dose is far too high far too quick for an extremely mild case of anxiety and depression).  GP stated only side effect to worry about was decreased libido. 6 weeks later my partner of 6 years kicked me out of our home and terminated our relationship - I had become increasingly aggressive and volatile.  I am also a diabetic with glaucoma problems in my eyes and I am pedantic about my eye health and keeping both eye pressures stable - they have been for the last 5 years.  Once I read about the bad side effects, I immediately had my pressures checked - both eyes had skyrocketed to dangerous levels.  Have slowly weaned off these pills over a period of 8 weeks with my eye pressures slowly retuning back to acceptable levels and have been free of this horrendous chemical for 3 weeks now.",1,17
Lexapro,"I have been dealing with anxiety for a few months now. Initially went to the ER a few times not know what it was. Then was told it could be anxiety and took Lorazepam (prescribed from the ER doctor) which worked amazingly! Then went to a primary care doctor and was prescribed 10mg of this medication Lexapro. After 2 hours of taking the medication I had a terrible panic attack with a fast heartbeat, super fatigued, dizziness, sweats and a little lethargic. The doctor wanted me to cut the pill and half and continue taking it but I am way too afraid and would rather not deal with those side effects and just deal with my anxiety and self heal.",2,22
Lexapro,"I have been on other SSRIs which were ineffective, however I found Lexapro to be intolerable.  Other SSRIs had their minor side effects for the first couple of weeks such as strange dreams, nausea, etc., however, Lexapro wreaked havoc on me from day 1.  Just 4 hours after taking my first 10mg dose (at 8am), I wanted to vomit, was very dizzy and felt confused and disoriented.  I also had an extremely dry mouth.  By 5pm that evening my anxiety had gotten 10 times worse, and I suffered the absolutely WORST panic attack I have ever had in my life.  My panic was so bad I briefly passed out.   Everyone reacts differently to different drugs, so this is just my experience.  However, I personally find this to be the worst SSRI in terms of side effects, which are intolerable.",1,30
Lexapro,"Initially was prescribed Xanax 20yrs ago after I started having panic attacks and anxiety which led to agoraphobia and social anxiety. Xanax was fantastic and I soon resumed living normally on a low dose of only 1mg a day. Eventually I stopped taking it all together however I always had a script for them and would take 0.5mg for flying, or would take it to help sleep.  More recently I have had some general stresses and spoke to my doc about my lack of sleep and anxiety. He suggested taking Lexapro to help with this. I started with a 1/4 of a 10mg tab for the first 4 days. Then moved up to half a tab for 6 days. And tomorrow I start a full tablet. Though Ive only just started, Im happy to report no side effects and I do believe I am already reaping some benefit. I'm sleeping well at night and I dont seem to be as moody as I can sometimes be. Im actually looking forward to increasing to the full 10mg. Thats unlike me. And I like this change. Id recommend it to others.",9,54
Lexapro,"Lexapro has worked wonders for me with absolutely zero side effects. I have noticed my anxiety attacks and need for xanax decreased to almost zero since I started this drug. It has almost entirely cured my anxiety and the resulting depression and I have a zest for life again. I never thought I'd feel like I did in my twenties again. I never realized how much of my symptoms were anxiety and depression. I had narrowed it down to just getting older. I have so much more energy and have lexapro to thank for this. Everyone reacts differently to every drug, but for me it has been a miracle.",10,103
Lexapro,"I was going in college and had never taken any type of mental medication but I had noticed that the anxiety and depression I was experiencing, both with friends and family was more or less constant throughout my life. Once I started taking the drug, I began to feel a more constant mood after about a month of 5 mg every night. I had less anxiety and more motivation to do things and maintain the relationships I had made, and also to encourage new ones. I had had mood swings severely before I had taken the drug and after I began to feel very consistent. I feel as though I can function normally, that I can have conversations with people without freaking out or worrying as much on how I came across to others. I still have worries, but they are worries over things that are easier to deal with and not earth-shattering like when I was off of the drug. It has greatly increased my desire to excel in school and life. I use it with both a healthy diet and exercise as well.",9,52
Lexapro,"I was suffering from severe anxiety and I have been on Lexapro for 3 months now. You won't notice the difference immediately, takes  time around 2 to 3 weeks to notice. It improved my life significantly. I'm happier, relaxed and more confident. My hands stopped shaking and I feel more control of myself now. Only issue is that it gives me headaches from time to time but minor and I got brown tongue after using it for 3 weeks. Doctor said drinking more water will help.",10,32
Lexapro,"Here's my experience with this drug. Day 3 of taking 5 mg with Coreg, skin was hot and couldn't sleep. So I stopped. About a month and a half later, new doctor put me on Lexapro because Coreg screwed up my adrenal glands. Took 5 mg for a week with metoprolol, then 3 days on 10 mg and skin was itchy and burning. Ended up in ER and they gave me hydroxyzine in case of allergy. It could be the manufacturer Lupin that has a chemical in there that does damage to me. This is my experience, maybe Lexapro goes well for you. Will NOT take this ever again.",1,15
Lexapro,"Give Lexapro a chance dont be scared  Its amazing how good you will feel. I was sick the first 5 days on 5mg.  Got better after that, then I increased after 2 weeks to 10mg got little sick again its very normal .  Im now on 4 weeks I feel Amazing  No more anxiety or fears .  Please dont give up and give it a chance . Good luck",10,94
Lexapro,Slowly but surely took the edge off of my constant anxiety and made life manageable again. May not work for everyone but it has worked wonders for me.,10,40
Lexapro,"I use to read these reviews and be so scared to take the medication. I was scared of the side effects and horrible stories that I read about. However, my anxiety got so bad after I had my 4th baby, I knew I had to do something. I started taking 5 mg. Only side effect I had was extreme tiredness and some yawning. I then went up to 10mg and now Im on 20mg. I think I began to feel a difference after a couple of weeks. This medication has really helped me. I hadnt even able to drive the freeway for 7 years due to extreme anxiety and fear. I am now driving the freeway with no anxiety or panic feeling, and I owe it to this medication. I am very happy that I gave it a chance, Lexapro has greatly improved my life.",9,64
Lexapro,"Lexapro really reeeeaaaally helped with my panic disorder and whilst on it I didnt have a single panic attack, however, it gave me incredible insomnia and RLS - that creates issues within itself. Im now swapping to a lovan and I notice the best difference. Lexapro was not for me, you may also need to try out several before you find the right one.",8,10
Lexapro,"This drug ruined my life. I took it one month and wasn't monitored. I think it helps some people, but it needs to be monitored weekly when starting it or any other medication that affects thinking.",1,10
Lexapro,I was prescribed Lexapro after a transitive event in my life that cause anxiety and panic attacks.  I started on 10mg after a few weeks was increased to 15mg and then after another two months was increased to 20mg.  I had a suicidal thoughts and called my doc right away... my dosage was lowered... I didnt notice that the panic attacks came back and the break downs started.  I was increased back to the 20mg under docs supervision.   The break downs are less frequent but I noticed they are worse during my period. These breakdowns are intense. I have panic attacks and the crying is hard to stop.  Has anyone else noticed the effects are worse during their cycle?,7,24
Lexapro,"Im 53 and have never needed any type of anti anxiety med. I had a illness and started on prednisone and an antibiotic. After a few days I had the worst bout of insomnia  (prednsione?)Ive ever had and was awake for 4.5 days straight. The insomnia lasted almost two weeks and then I started freaking out and had my first real panic attack and that lump in my stomach of anxiousness just wouldnt go away.  Dr prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro and 5 mg of Ambien. It took a few weeks for the Lexapro to really kick in. Ive been taking it for about 6 months now and feel much better. It has the ability to take the edge off, although it can make you a little  non-caring  (stuff that could bother me or set me off now is ... I really dont care, lol) No side effects for me... been a real benefit for me personally!",9,34
Lexapro,"At first I was like no way can I endure these stupid side effects, you know what I mean. But after 10 month as life is chill and stuff that ridiculously mattered so so much  doesn't matter as much... Reduced the amount I'm now taking too thanks to my Doctor.",9,15
Lexapro,"First let me start by saying that I have tried quite a few medications for both anxiety and depression. Lexapro has been my favorite so far! I was on it for a while for anxiety and panic and I noticed my anxiety and panic drastically reduce. The first time I really noticed it was when I was sitting in my car at a red light. Before, I had HORRIBLE anxiety and panic at red lights because I felt trapped. However, I noticed one time while sitting at a red light after being on Lexapro that I didn't feel any panic at all! It was such a great feeling. Then...I did something stupid. I noticed that I gained some weight and attributed it to the lexapro. I decided to go off of it because of this and my doctor prescribed me Bupropion. HORRIBLE DECISION. That drug made me the absolute worst version of myself so I quit it cold turkey and now I am desperately wishing I hadn't quit the lexapro. I would take the slight weight gain any day over not feeling the anxiety and panic.",8,27
Lexapro,Ive had anxiety my whole life. Was on Paxil for years &amp; gained 60 pounds but it helped with my anxiety. Had been off it for years &amp; anxiety came with a vengeance a few months ago. I tried everything I could think of to avoid medication. On a scale of 1-10 my anxiety was a 12. I dreaded waking up to face another day of torment. I was started on 5mg of lexapro &amp; .25 mg Xanax. It increased my anxiety &amp; I had no appetite. I was having weird feelings in my feet &amp; hands &amp; almost like electric shocks in my leg. Had my lexapro upped to 10mg &amp; switched to Clonazepam. That was 6 days ago. I had no increased side effects from the lexapro except Im tired a lot. All the weird feelings in my feet &amp; hands have stopped. This is the best I have felt in 2 months. I wish I had started taking it sooner. I woke up today looking forward to enjoying the day. Dont let all the negative reviews scare u. It did make things worse before they got better so try to stick it out.,6,19
Lexapro,"I was originally on Prozac for almost a year, and eventually weaned off of it. My depression came back and my anxiety was at an all time high so my doctor decided to start me on lexapro due to the terrible side effects I had while on Prozac. I was very optimistic for this to work, but after about a month and a half I noticed no improvement, if anything my anxiety had gotten so much worse and I always felt like a robot. I would go days with no interest in anything and the days I would have emotion were just short lived. I felt like I had to fake putting on a smile, laughing, doing anything someone else would find enjoyable. After about 2 months on the medication I would wake up in the morning and violently vomit for about 10 minutes. This went on for about a week, so I decided to call my doctor and they explained that vomiting may occur. After this I had had enough of Lexapro and decided to get off it ASAP.",2,9
Lexapro,"I was scared after reading the reviews, but I have been on this medication for two weeks  and I've had no bad side effects. I'm just taking 5 mg, and I can go to 10mg, but I like 5mg so far, so I'm not changing it yet . Before this medication I could barely drive or work, so I'm relieved that it is working for now.",10,40
Lexapro,"Does anyone know if the insomnia from lexapro goes away, I've been taking this for three weeks and I have terrible insomnia, I can get to sleep (with the help of Zolpidem) but I can never stay asleep for a full night, I wake up around three and that is it.",5,17
Lexapro,"I'm 33 and was having trouble coping with a possible terminal illness that left me with severe anxiety and depression. My neurologist put me on 10mg lexapro I was already on 1mg Ativan a day and Ambien at night. I took one 10mg lexapro on empty stomach around 11 am and had some nausea then later crazy anxiety. Not anxiety attacks just horrible anxiety later that night I was super restless with restless leg syndrome. Almost went to ER  but found this page and noticed people saying it gets better week 2 and 3 so I decided to stick it out. After day 4 or 5 I finally went outside. The first week is the worst. Anxiety, loss of apatite, headaches, diarrhea.  Week two felt a little better, three a little better four much better. Then upped me to 20 mg switched manufacturer to round pill 20 mg been breaking in half then quarter so 15mg started to increase anxiety and now past 8 days or so sore throat and diarrhea I think its not the dose but manufacturer.",0,10
Lexapro,"I had 2 experiences with Lexapro. First the good news.. it takes the edge off . You will initially feel better , at least I did. BUT.. after 5 to 6 months .. I was tired all the time, had a lack of interest in anything , gained weight which I couldnt lose and found myself without anxiety but felt depressed. Now the WORST part.. it was very very very difficult to get off! I felt severe depression and an awful feeling of a constant lump in my Stomach riddled with anxiety. I couldnt take it so went back on. I then did my research . I gradually got off it by taking Vitamin C, B complex, turmeric, And  rodiola. I exercised (walked  and meditated every day. I eventually was able to get off over a 3 month period. I would never take the drug again. Hate to say never but thats how I feel. I am Off 2 years now and feel well!  I found vitamins, herbs, meditation and exercise are the best tools For anxiety.",8,32
Lexapro,"I started lexapro a week ago, for panic disorder and anxiety. An hour after first dose at 12.5 mg ,my anxiety got 20 times worse.  IT felt like I was going crazy!! I couldn't sit still. Then came the sweating, the numbness in hands and feet. I was panicking and terrified to leave the house for anything. .Since starting lexepro my anxiety got worse. Taking Lexapro is like having a bad trip. THE worse part was I  was unable to sit still paced around the house day and night. My doctor wants me to stay on it but I stopped taking it 3 days ago and feel better than I was on Lexapro.",1,21
Lexapro,"This medicine Lexapro is helping so far although gradually. I was much worse two weeks ago when I first started taking this, very anxious and afraid of feeling that way. The first few days were uncomfortable but I had to keep reminding myself that this too shall pass and I got through it. I've read that it takes 6-8 weeks for full benefit but if you start to show some improvement this is a good sign.",9,19
Lexapro,I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder recently. I've been taking the Lexapro for over a month and its made me anxiety much worse then before. It also is making me super irritable as well as unable to sleep.,1,10
Lexapro,"This drug has been wonderful for my mental health. I have taken it for years and love it for that reason. However, it has given me some adverse side effects physically. I have been having bad diarrhea and headaches for the past few years, and have gotten a colonoscopy and everything was fine. Forgot to take my medicine with me on a trip and didnt take it for a week, and realized my diarrhea got much better. It then made me question if this medication has caused these adverse side effects all these years. I have since decided to taper off of it, and it has been hard as well emotionally and physically. I wish I would have known how hard it is to get off this medication before I started, but it has given me wonderful results for my mental health when I really needed it.",5,12
Lexapro,"The first couple of weeks were very difficult. I had increased anxiety, much worse than the anxiety I was being treated for but that stopped right at the 2 week mark, overnight. I felt a lot better but still not quite where I wanted to be. I went back to the doctor at the 3 week mark and he increased the dose from 10mg to 20mg and immediately I felt a difference. I did not have increased anxiety this time like I did when I started. In fact, the first day I felt very relaxed, almost euphoric. On the second day I felt more like my old self, the anxiety and intrusive thoughts seemed to be very minor. I did have anxiety in the mornings for a while but that has started to get better also. My anxiety is nearly zero at this point and I find that I am better able to handle stressful situations.  I 100% recommend Lexapro just stick with it. The bad stuff goes away pretty quickly and after a month or so you will find yourself again. It has been a God send for me and I am so thankful for it.",9,48
Lexapro,"I was recently diagnosed with Anxiety disorder and my dr prescribed me Lexapro. I took this medicine only 3 times because of all the side effects I had. Not only did it make me feel weird and out of touch with reality I had many other symptoms including dizziness, sweating, anxiety, headaches, and nausea. I couldnt sleep at night and I also felt very psychedelic when I took it. My pupils were HUGE and I almost felt like I was tripping. I kept unintentionally clenching my jaw really hard and I couldnt get comfortable. I threw up multiple times and couldnt eat without feeling sick. I immediately discontinued taking it and dont plan to try anything else. I was weary about taking an SSRI to begin with due to being a very natural person with no intention of taking something that would effect my brain in an unnatural way. Although this did not work for me I know it works for others and has been life changing for people.",2,28
Lexapro,I am two weeks in. Started 2.5 mg for a week and 5 mg the second. Not sure how much it's helping yet but haven't had a whole lot of side effects yet besides mild nausea and dizziness. Will keep taking it as it may take a few more weeks to work so let's see.,6,9
Lexapro,"Ive had anxiety stemming from a very unstable and frightful childhood. Parents constantly fighting and kept me up all night worrying countless nights for over 10 years. My worst anxiety was my relationship anxiety, it ruined a relationship with someone I truly believe was the love of my life. Since starting on lexapro I am the person Ive always wished I was, I feel more like myself than ever. I am a much more secure person now and I only wish I had found lexapro years ago. A huge success!",10,54
Lexapro,"I took 5mg of lexapro the last two nights, didnt sleep great last night and felt a bit anxious, but tonight it is 10x worse. My anxiety is through the roof, my chest hurts from the heart palpitations. I have been shaking and feeling nauseous and sweaty and my legs feel restless. I am absolutely exhausted, and did not have this issue two nights ago. Never taking this again. Currently attempting to sleep before waking up for work at 5am. Very VERY displeased.",1,14
Lexapro,"The first couple of weeks I had nausea but it went away! I had anxiety &amp; depression. Ive been taking for about 4-5 months, This pill has changed my life I get excited about a sunny day I have for the first time in 6 years made new friends and the colour is back in the world for me. I used to be very underweight like 40kg and hated food to gaining 10kgs in 4 months and enjoying food &amp; loving my body. After a couple months on this pill I just noticed  hey I dont cry at the bottom of the shower anymore . Things are better. I hope this helps someone out there",10,68
Lexapro,"I suffered from depression and anxiety. I went to CBT and talked to a therapist who definitely changed the way I think and approach issues which I struggled with. However my symptoms started to creep back after a few months.  I found it difficult to drive, I got anxious and I had to focus really hard on traffic situations. Shopping centres were too loud and busy for me and broke me into a sweat.  I went to the doctor to try some medication and he put me on Lexapro 10mg. I finally feel in control. Don't get me wrong, I still get small bouts of depression but I'm nowhere near where I used to be. My anxiety attacks have pretty much stopped. Instead of having them every day, I might get them now and again.  I'm far more optimistic and chilled on a daily basis and I feel like I can maybe get back to the way I was.",10,30
Lexapro,"I a 33 yo male and I have been taking 10 mg lexapro for about 5 weeks now. I started on 5 mg for the first week, after switching from sertraline for anxiety. I have had at least one panic attack every day for the past week. I have been to the ER twice in the past 2 weeks for what I thought was a heart attack or stroke. My blood work is normal, my EKG is normal. I was giving valium or lorazepam and told to relax it was just a bad panic attack. Today is the first day of tapering off of lexapro, I cant wait to get it out of my system.",1,11
Lexapro,I like it. I'm a lot more calm than I used to be. I was recently diagnosed with social anxiety disorder.,9,9
Lexapro,"I took Lexapro for a couple of years. It basically numbed me out emotionally which was better than being distressed, but it made me tired, took away my sex drive, and made me very apathetic towards life. Overall, the negatives outweighed the positives. I call these the I don't give a damn pills.",3,22
Lexapro,"It helped with stress, but reduced sex drive and I lost feeling in my penis during intercourse.",3,15
Lexapro,"My doctor insisted that I take Lexapro for my anxiety. After only 27 days of 5mg doses I felt like I was going insane. The disgusting side effects were numerous including; excessive sweating, stomach cramps, dark thoughts, diarrhoea, sleeplessness, decreased sexual drive, confusion and irregular heartbeat. The withdrawal process has left me having scary panic attacks and paranoia. I wish Id never heard of the drug and I will never go back to that doctor again. My life feels totally ruined from this drug and I have slurred speech and increased anxiety. Please avoid this.",1,29
Lexapro,"I took Lexapro 5mg for 5 months for anxiety. I had no problem except first week being tired. Dr. then prescribed 10mg and I developed restless leg syndrome. I tapered off with no problem and the RLS disappeared. The doctor told me the problem was not from the Lexapro. Also, the weight gain was horrible. He also stated NOT from Lexapro.  It is now two years later and had an incident in family and developed anxiety again. Back on the Lexapro 5mg. Well, let me tell you. I took it six days and stopped. I had racing heart, numbness in leg and so dizzy I almost hit the floor. Once again, doctor said this is not from Lexapro. I talked him into clonazepam for short term. He was reluctant but I am responsible and have done clonazepam in the past for short term.  It is 0.5 daily for two weeks and then a short taper. We will see what happens. I will not do Lexapro again. Also, blood pressure was too high 144/88. I am checking it every day now. The latest reading was 117/78.",1,10
Lexapro,"I had never understood that I had anxiety attacks until later in life, I honestly thought everyone was the same. I was diagnosed with anxiety and was prescribed Lexapro. Great results, OK, the sweating was an annoyance but I guess it cleaned my pores. I was lucky not to have any other adverse effects so a ten from me.",10,21
Lexapro,"I have been prescribed Lexapro 10 mg for my anxiety , PTSD and panic attacks. I seen a huge improvement in my energy, mood after 3rd day. I was a drug user in the past. I thought I would mention this as the only side effects I experienced was abdominal pain in the first day. I believe my body tolerates everything better than someone who never used anything. Keep that in mind as its a good thing. The med is definitely effective and without it life becomes black and white. I have used it for a month and it does work. Some people may need more time some don't but stick with it. If there is a case where it doesn't help you. Change to other medication and don't suffer. Life is beautiful and you deserve to feel good and you will!!!!",10,46
Lexapro,"Im on day four of Lexapro, and I feel like Im going insane. I  can hardly concentrate enough to write this review. I read up on the symptoms and was aware of all side effects before starting the med, but I had no idea it could be this bad. Feels like all the symptoms I were having prior to starting the med, increased x 10. I havent slept but 4 hours the past two days, I cant complete my sentences, yawning like crazy, And I feel paranoid. Way worse than before. IDK if I should stick it out feeling like this or quit before it gets worse. Following up with my  psychiatrist tomorrow.",0,30
Lexapro,"I have panic disorder and anxiety and I have found Lexapro helping quite a bit. I have pretty hectic side effects. I have never had insomnia in my entire life and now can't sleep at all - feel very restless in the mornings in bed, have crazy vivid dreams - although I actually LOVE this haha its so fun, etc.) I was really impatient and wanted it to work straight away but I'm at exactly a month now and its only started to work last two weeks ish. I'm on 20mg. It helps with physical panic symptoms - I don't feel the prickles/tingles and sick stomach as much, nor have I felt panicked for a while actually, which is nice. I still have anxiety, especially because a massive anxiety symptom of mine is brain fog, so because I can't sleep, I feel very unclear and that gives me anxiety. (hard to explain). It also helps with worry - I don't find myself ruminating and overthinking everything as much.",8,16
Lexapro,"I began taking Escitalopram 10 mg in March 2019 and my dose was upped to 20 mg in June 2019. I have been taking it consistently for 5 months for general anxiety and depression and have definitely noticed a positive impact on my mood and anxiety levels. For the first two weeks, I experienced some side effects like a major panic attack and increased anxiety initially, nausea and fatigue along with constant yawning even when I wasn't tired. These side effects have since all disappeared. I have noticed that I still have some anxiety at times but it happens less often and when it does happen, it is easier to manage and doesn't get out of control. My mood has also improved and I do not experience the really low feelings that I used to experience and I have less intrusive and negative thoughts. I have also been attending therapy and find that this is helpful. I feel more in control of my emotions now.",9,36
Lexapro,"I was put on 10mg once a day for anxiety and panic disorder. I took my first dose on empty stomach around 5pm about an hour later I noticed a strong sense of anxiety. I was not hungry for dinner. When I laid down to go to sleep later that night I noticed I was super restless ,like restless leg syndrome and taking  my Ativan 1 mg and my Ambien didnt even put me to sleep. I knew this was going to be hard but I told myself do what you need to and try to get through two weeks because its supposed to get better. Im on day 4 or 5 and I finally went outside. Its getting better. Not anxious 24/7 anymore my body is adapting. Still have muscle twitching and Im only hungry rarely but Im hoping it will improve. The headaches are subsiding the first three days were the worst in terms of headaches.  Im excited to see how I feel in a week this drug sucks hopefully it will be worth it",0,22
Lexapro,"I started having really bad anxiety in college. Being away from home and not in a familiar place caused extreme anxiety to set in. To the point I couldnt eat. I would immediately vomit if I ate. I would come home on the weekend, and I was fine. It was the weirdest thing. I thought I was crazy. After months of trying to deal with it myself, I talked to my doctor. He gave me lexapro 10 mg. I didnt notice any effects for about a month, but I function completely normally now. My last 3 years of college were the best of my life and I made a ton of friends. I can promise without lexapro I wouldnt have had the same experience at all. Dont wait, just talk to your doctor.",7,33
Lexapro,"I took a single 10mg Lexapro dosage at around 9 am on a weekend. Immediately I noticed a loss of appetite, but it was manageable. It wasnt until about 7 hours later that I noticed my throat felt like it was partially closed. After another 7 hours, I had one of the worst panic attacks of my life. I was sweating, chest pain, heart beating out of my chest, nauseous. Seriously considered going to the ER. I eventually fell asleep around 5 am and woke up around 9am with the exact same symptoms. Truly awful. The only good that came from it was that I was exhausted by nighttime, which led to some solid sleep over the span of 2 nights. Still, it took me at least a week to feel normal again &amp; thats after only a single dose!  The half-life in this medication is extremely long. My advice to anyone reading this with similar symptoms: Stay hydrated, get sleep (i know its tough but its a must) &amp; try and eat!  I will never take it again.",1,34
Lexapro,"I've had anxiety since I was 12. Where I would have episodes of panic But never realized it was anxiety until about 5 months ago.  Panic And anxiousness came suddenly but stuck this time rather then a couple days like the past.  I suffered about 3 months where I couldn't even wake up without having an attack.  I couldn't sit/ stand sleep I thought I was going crazy.  Dr prescribed me Lexapro (escitalopram) .  Been on for 6 weeks 10 mg. First 2-3 weeks only made everything worse but I stuck it out. Week 6 I'm starting to feel things calm down a bit.  I hope it gets better everyday. Started Trazadone 3 days ago and I haven't woken up as panicky as I usually do.  The first couple weeks on Lexapro made me nauseous more anxiety, weak, and it felt like my skin was on fire.  But all of that subsided.  I did go to the ER and that's when they gave me Ativan which made it possible for a couple days. But I don't take that anymore as it increased depression for me. Hang in there. I finally see some hope.",7,22
Lexapro,Lexapro has helped to take away the awful stomach stress l lived with for many years.  I am now able to better manage my anxiety issues without extra intervention. I've only had positive experience with this medication.  I have been taking 10mg for 8 years. And suffered from anxiety for 20 years prior to that.,10,68
Lexapro,"I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression since 18. I haven taken almost every medication for anxiety and they didn't work - until I was given klonipin. I started the medication and it was working well until I notice my intake was going up I took klonipin for 3 years and if I didn't take it I would almost have a seizure. My anxiety was horrible I couldn't sleep couldn't go anywhere without having a panic attack. My heart will be racing as soon as I got up in the morning I thought I was literally going to dependent on klonipin my whole life. Until I got fed up and went to see another psychiatrist  I told him what I was on and he told me he was going to prescribe me lexapro one a day 10 mg. The first two days I actually slept and the 3rd day I was feeling better. I didn't take klonapin, as bad as I wanted too I  manage to stop it with lexapro. It has  been a month and I've been on lexapro back to my normal self happy no panic attacks. I've been going places with out any fear I haven't touched those klonapin",10,55
Lexapro,"Took 1 dose of 10 mg Friday night and just felt extremely sleepy. Saturday morning while doing my morning routine, I told my husband to take me to the ER. My skin was on fire, my thoughts and speech were delayed and I was shaking so much. ER doctor told me to stop taking it and there was no antidote or anything he could give me and for me to wait for the half life of the medicine which is 48 hours. After a few light bad days from my adverse effects, my panic attacks came back super intense. I thought everything was going to kill me and I stayed in my bed for weeks. Now on paxil and Xanax but still working on exact dosage, still working better for me than Lexapro.",1,14
Lexapro,"Been on escitalopram for 8 weeks (51 yo woman). SUPER lethargic week 1 as I went from 5 to 10 mg. Urinary problems in week 2 only.  No orgasm in week 3 and still now. Benefits crept up SLOWLY.  First was PHYSICAL benefits in week 4: no more adrenalin rushes or heart palpitations and my body just felt really good (libido great despite lack of orgasm). This was huge but still no change in my thinking.  Week 7, obsessive thinking and worry subsided noticeably. Start of week 8 it REALLY kicked in. I have clarity, a sense of calm, I smile a lot, I genuinely take time for others, my mind is not racing or jumbled with worry, I am willing to ask for what I want more confidently.  Biggest thing: I am no longer on edge AT ALL. Still hoping for benefit to self-esteem &amp; being more outgoing.  Dr. will up me to 15 mg for this, but I will wait since I literally see improvement daily &amp; I prefer lowest dose. I  LOVE the change in myself!  Patience &amp; paying attention to little improvements is  key!",9,88
Lexapro,"Did one week at 5mg before being upped to 10mg, on day 7 I started with tingling and prickling in my legs, which then spread to my arms. Felt like I had rolled in nettles, did 5 days at 10mg before doing another 3 days at 5mg. Even though the tingling has worn off if its still there, I have also had horrendous indigestion and sinus congestion. I am on day 6 of stopping and feel like I have been hit by a bus. I have felt worse since being on these than I did before!  Shame it didnt work for me after hearing so many positive reviews.  Also this drug is one of the worst for withdrawing off of, so be mindful of that before starting this medication.",1,9
Lexapro,Started taking escitalopram three years ago due to obsessive thoughts of very morbid kind. They would be stuck in my head for years until I was prescribed cipralex (escitalopram) 20 mg UK brand . Ive been on medication for two years and then tapered off with minor side effects. I decided to quit because I have completely forgotten how it is to be my old self and I thought that it was not that horrible after all and I could handle it. Several months without cipralex and I was having horrible obsessive thoughts again. So now I am starting therapy again. Fingers crossed,10,22
Lexapro,"It is a miracle drug!! I'm from india,  I have been social anxiety and lack of concentration, low self confident etc.  I'm afraid of this world, one day my doctor prescribed me lexapro 10 mg, and you know what???  On my first day I felt a difference and after 6 days I'm more confident, more talkative, have more self esteem, anxiety gone 95 percent, I feel more energy, now I' m not afraid of this world, I enjoy life and making new friends. I think all people on this planet take this drug even if they have any symptoms like I did. This drug make them complete, and side effects?  No I don't have any except delayed ejaculation, which I think its ok coz it make my wife happy  ;)  and thanks to all, I pray for all u guys.",0,65
Lexapro,"Hang in there!  I am a woman in my mid-fifties who has developed paralyzing anxiety over the last few years.  It got to the point this spring where I couldn't go to work.  My doctor prescribed Lexapro.  I started at 10 mg, and he increased it to 20 mg after the first week.  I had never taken any antidepressants before.  It took time -- but it does work.  Slow improvement.  I am on week 9, and I finally feel like my old self.   It is so difficult to think you will ever feel better.  I know.  But, it will get better!  It may take time, but hang in there.  The Lexapro has made a tremendous difference in the life.  I hope it does for you as well.",10,95
Lexapro,"I have been on Lexapro 10mg 3x- most recently was Jan-May and then weaned myself off (under doctors supervision) over 6 weeks and had no problems with withdrawal. I have recently started back because of recent stress in my life (nasty divorce) which left me worrying constantly, debilitating anxiety, unable to sleep and/or eat. For me its the panic thats horrible. So I started back on Lexapro 10mg 3 weeks ago today. The first 2 weeks were tough....it seemed to take longer to kick in this time and I actually referred to this site a dozen times to reassure myself that it would indeed start to work and it did! I did have the increased anxiety, loss of appetite (lost 10lbs in 2 weeks), the  internal shakes , morning dread and insomnia for the first 2 weeks. I would say around day 10-14 I started to feel the meds taking the edge off and by day 18 I had almost no anxiety at all. Literally none. Its so worth the wait if you can just hang in there through the first few weeks.",10,102
Lexapro,I took Lexapro for years. No one told me that it had side effects of hair loss. Upon doing my own research and going to several doctors and a dermatologist that told me there was nothing I could do I figured it out on my own.,2,12
Lexapro,"Im 51 and have been on 10 mg of lexapro for about 18 years and it has done wonders.  Ive been feeling some up tick in my anxiety and depression so the doctor upped my dosage to 15mg. Its been a week now and the side effects are awful.  I feel lethargic, sad, unmotivated, terrible head ache and have 0 appetite - Ive lost about 10 lbs. in a week.  Im going to cut back to 10mg and hope these wicked side effects go away quickly, and deal with my anxiety differently.",5,27
Lexapro,"Hi guys, hoping someone can help. I was on 5mgs of generic Lexapro and still felt uneasy so after a week the doctor put me on 10mg. Been on 10mg for a week and a half and since yesterday I have felt horrible and struggle to find the motivation to do anything or go anywhere. I take it before bed and find it really hard to get out of bed in the mornings. Can someone please tell me is this normal and when will it settle down? I am back to work in 2 weeks and am so scared I wont be ready to go back - thanks guys :)",7,26
Lexapro,"I was suffering from horrible anxiety and panic attacks and I became agoraphobic. I hated it and being an owner of 5 businesses I had to have help. I actually came to this site and read all the reviews before I started. The first 2 weeks were tough but I was prepared because of the reviews. I had vertigo, a little increased anxiety,  couldn't cry, and blurred vision. I started with half a dose the first week 5mg and then upped it to the 10 mg. But if you stick with this , I'm at a month and with behavioral therapy and lexapro...I'm living my life again and beginning to feel great again. I'm mad I waited so long to try it...its worked amazing for me but like I said you have to get through the adjustment period and at about 2 weeks things calm down and you start to feel more at peace. Good luck!!",10,77
Lexapro,"This medication worked great for me! The first 2 weeks were not great (insomnia, increased anxiety, some GI upset, blurry vision). Wait out the first 2 weeks if you can! The first 2 weeks are not the final result by far!  This medication destroys anxiety after 4+ weeks.  I took the medication for agoraphobia  caused by Xanax withdrawal. It worked great AFTER 4+ weeks. The results are up and down until about week 4. Meaning, youll feel worse and better on weeks 1-4. Then in week 4 it became consistent. I did get euphoria on day 3-4 but that didnt last long. Dont judge the medication for better or for worse in the first several weeks. Dont judge it too soon!  I had side effects in the beginning but they went away after about 3-4 weeks.",9,74
Lexapro,"I have to say that in the last two months I have experienced terrible anxiety. I wasnt sleeping good or eating well. My weight was very low, so my doctor prescribed me with Lexapro. I had never taken anxiety medicine at all so I didnt know what to expect. The first four-five days on it were rough. I was very very exhausted and was unmotivated, but I kept taking it and Im on day 7 now and I feel more alert, more focused. My friends have told me that they have seen a difference in my face and I seem more relaxed. I up my dose tomorrow night so I will see what that does, but if I feel this great, I cant imagine how well I will feel when Im at 10mg.",10,27
Lexapro,"Since about the age of 3, I had severe obsessive thoughts (counting, tapping, clicking my teeth) and constant fears. Obviously, back in the 70s and 80s there wasn't much awareness regarding childhood mental health! I was told to sit still and learn to cope!  It wasn't until my 40s and suffering from debilitating panic attacks (ambulance rides, ER visits) that I finally decided I would try medication. Short term meds like Xanax make me depressed, so I wanted something daily. Wow. What a difference Lexapro has made for me! Certainly there was an adjustment period, but after nearly a year (and also having to work with the med) I am an entirely new person! No more obsessive counting or tapping, zero panic attacks. I almost had to grieve for a piece of me that is now gone. Only possible downside is that I'm not as obsessive with cleaning or my daily responsibilities (I may put things off a day or so) BUT I'll take the good with the bad as long as I don't have panic attacks!",10,47
Lexapro,"I was prescribed Lexapro 10mg for anxiety. I took the pill for two days and what followed was the worst week of my life. I would describe my anxiety as a little more than mild. It was never debilitating. I shouldn't have been prescribed it. I took one pill in the morning and woke up in the middle of the night with a full blown panic attack. I had never experienced anything like that in my life. For three full days I couldn't sleep or eat. I had no desire to do anything but was incapable of sitting or lying down. I was constantly in a panic because I thought my life was over. I would start crying, again something that never happened to me before. On the third day after I had stopped the drug I finally felt normal again. The feelings did come back over night and I'm still feeling effects this morning. Please use this drug with extreme caution. I know it can be a help to a lot of people but make sure to do your research.",1,23
Lexapro,"My entire life and I mean even as a child I can remember overthinking and worrying about everything. I have dealt with the anxiety that comes from the worry and the panic attacks too. It wasnt until I turned 40 that I mentioned this to a new doctor I started seeing and he prescribed Lexapro. My god, I wish someone had opened my eyes before. I assumed everyone felt this way but after a month on Lexapro it was a weight lifted off of my shoulders. I am so happy to not feel all of that anxiety anymore. Normal stress is fine but the overwhelming feeling of anxiety is gone and I hope it stays that way. Its been close to 4 years now and its still working for me. Lexapro really is an amazing drug.",9,70
Lexapro,"This drug has done wonders for me. Ive always suffered from random anxiety. Anything could trigger me and there goes my mind and heart rate. I used to take Xanax for it but wanted something more consistent. I discovered Lexapro and it was the best thing. After 6 months of being on it my anxiety is 99% gone and dont need Xanax anymore. In the beginning I had a really rough time with coming off the Xanax and starting the Lexapro. I couldnt sleep, no appetite (plus!) lol, and felt horrible. Id say after about 5-6 weeks my body adjusted and I feel better then ever. My energy is there and I feel really happy and chipper but its all genuine. Im on 10mg and will continue with it. Miracle drug for me.",10,48
Lexapro,"This medication changed my life within a week I felt different. I take it before bedtime and wake up feeling awake in the morning and my mind and body no longer raced beyond my control. I almost cried when I realized what I was feeling must be what a normal person feels like! I have never been more thankful in my life!!!  I have suffered my entire life with overwhelming anxiety and depression. My Dr.  has also put me on  bupropium which I take in the morning.  My side effects, Sweating, diarrhea, and occasionally upset stomach and blurred vision are nothing compared to the emotional relief I now feel.",10,38
Lexapro,"I have been on 15 mg of this generic version of Lexapro for the last 4 years. It has changed my life. I still have moments of the month that make me more vulnerable to anxiety because of hormonal ups and downs, but overall, I feel like Ive found myself again. For the first year, I noticed some numbness in emotions. It was manageable and almost welcomed, since Id spent so much time over thinking and feeling things. I feel like this has balanced out over time. I also take it in the morning because it would cause me some insomnia at first. Please talk to a doctor prior to attempting to wean off this medication because it can be difficult. I feel like this medication has really changed my life for the better.",10,39
Lexapro,"I have been using Lexapro for almost 2 months now and the change has been amazing. I had suffered from anxiety and depression for most of my life and my doctor prescribing this medication has been a lifesaver for me. I used to have episodes of crying, extreme depression and suicidal thoughts but all those have gone away or diminished to the point where they're basically nonexistent. I feel like I can handle life and it's minor irritations with so much more confidence now. More than I have ever in the past. I still have issues and every day is still a battle at times but I don't know what I would do if I hadn't started on this medication. I'm lucky the only side effect I get is dizziness here and there and I have gained about 4 or 5 lb which I'm trying to keep hold of and not let that get out of hand. Otherwise I'm extremely happy!",10,29
Lexapro,"Anxiety/depression medications are tricky. Its difficult to know what one is best for you and your body so often you have to try a couple of different ones before you find your fit. In my personal experience its worth trying a few till you find whats right for you. Every medication is going to have side effects. For me Lexapro decreases my sex drive and causes constipation. The benefit of not having anxiety and being able to be a peaceful wife and mother is worth those two side effects for me. I have come off my Lexapro before and its true you will definitely have a lot of brains zaps, headache, a little irritability, and for me déjà vu. The brains zaps dont usually last more than two months and they are harmless so you just have to ignore them. Overall I think Lexapro is a great medication but as I said before its different for each individual. Talk to your doctor. Therapy is also very helpful for me.",10,25
Lexapro,"I took Lexapro 5mg for six months. The only problem I had was week one being very tired. I tapered with no problem. Two years later anxiety is back and doctor prescribed Lexapro again. After day 3, I have had enough. I woke up soak and wet in sweat and the nausea is just too much. The worst was when I got up for water I got so dizzy I almost hit the kitchen floor. Also, last time I packed on the pounds (like 20). I have lost 4lbs this go around. All I can look at is cereal and that is not even appealing. I know my doctor would prescribe clonazepam again but I really don't want to go that route. I will see how I feel in the next couple of days and call him if not better. I know people say to hang in there but just not for my anymore.",2,17
Lexapro,"Extreme anxiety, I was barely able to look anyone in the eye or leave my house.  Things were getting very bad and I didnt know how to fix or deal with it.  I was put on 10 mg lexapro by my new doctor.  I took half a pill a day for one week and didnt notice any difference.  I actually had pretty severe headaches, problems with my sexual life and extreme exhaustion.  I began taking a full 10 mg pill a few days ago (Im on day 10) and I have noticed I am back to my normal self.  The anxiety has completely gone away.   It seems it has saved my life.  The exhaustion and headaches went away.  It seems like this may be common in the first week or so.  The  negative to lexapro is some issues with sex (ejaculating specifically).  I have heard your body can adjust and eventually that will become normal as well.  I would definitely recommend people to give this medicine a few weeks to a month before giving up on it.  Mine took about 9 days to kick in.",8,38
Lexapro,"The only thing lexapro did for me is make me realize how good I felt when I wasnt on it. I was alright for the first 3 days, but on the third night I woke up with heartburn (which I had never had before) and was having a panic attack so severe that I went to the ER. I took lexapro the next day after and I constantly felt nauseous and had no appetite even though I felt like I was starving. Im getting better after being off of it but I have felt like a zombie ever since I got back from the ER. I only felt side effects from this drug.",1,18
Lexapro,"Lexapro 10mg has completely turned my life around! Finally feel back to my old self again after 2 years. Able to be present in the moment now and not constantly in my head. Little things that used to ruin my day only bother me for a few minutes now. Overall better mood happier more energy running again! Was a little out of it at the beginning and had some crazy dreams,  nothing too bad and all went away. I suffered from PMDD and could tell improvement in that too this month. My husband can tell a huge difference. Recommend to anyone suffering from anxiety/depression/PMS/PMDD etc... so happy I chose to do this for myself!",10,39
Lexapro,"Lexapro is my miracle drug. The most life changing medicine I've ever taken. Because of the mild sexual side effects, I'm not on it year round -  even though I should be. I take a  small 5 mg dose when I feel my life spinning out of control.  Within days, I go from  anti-social nervous wreck when I'm off it, to a very rational, confident and outgoing person when I'm back on it. If you're painfully anxious, negative and self-loathing (like I find myself sometimes) , Lexapro can make you the life of the party - an empathetic, engaged and caring human being you know you really are deep down inside. I started taking in my 40s- it would have drastically altered my life if I had started at a younger age. But that's okay, I have it now and I'm eternally grateful. Don't let the bad reviews dissuade you from trying it - try everything until you find a medicine that works for you. Best of luck - you deserve peace and happiness in your life.",10,123
Lexapro,"Lexapro is AMAZING if you can make it through the beginning. At first you may feel sick or not want to eat, a little depression here and there. But trust me if you can make it through that the rest is smooth sailing. I feel like myself again! Happy, can't stop talking and being joyful. I am so thankful I tried this because I really do not worry anymore I am just happy and and experiencing a lot more because I have such a clear head now(:",9,77
Lexapro,"I have been on Lexapro 5mg for about a month now. I have had severe nausea and vomiting for the the first two weeks. I then had acid reflex so bad that I was constantly coughing. Although it has calmed my anxiety I have been experiencing profuse sweating, increase in depression, diarrhea, acid reflex, nausea, vomiting and fevers. Before taking this medication I have been on Lamictal for my Bipolar disorder, manic depression and PTSD everything was going good and I felt normal again except my anxiety was through the roof.",3,16
Lexapro,I have been  on Lexapro four weeks now with no results. Should I wait another two weeks. Still have horrible anxiety. Afraid to go anywhere. This is not me. Just came out of nowhere. No problems in my life. Dont know what to do. Hate to start all over again.,0,28
Lexapro,"Med (Lexapro) worked as far as helping me relax. My body no longer hurts from constant stress. But Ive started to realize that Im always tired now, in a different way. Like sedated. Makes me feel super lazy and unmotivated. Which yes, I am better overall anxiety wise (even tho I still get some anxiety), I dont feel like its the med for me. I take it at night as well, played with taking it a few hours before/at bed. Still drowsy throughout the day no matter what. It was on my  good  list for my genesight results, at least I gave it a shot. Hope to be switched this week.",5,19
Lexapro,"Ive had general anxiety my entire life but got diagnosed with Panic Disorder almost a year ago after suffering a bad concussion. My panic attacks were so bad I couldnt be in a car or go anywhere with the fear of having an attack. I started Lexapro 10mg and instantly in the first week had less anxiety symptoms and no panic attacks, I was able to go back to my normal life. Eventually I needed to up my dosage to 20mg. Had no panic attacks at all but was having anxiety symptoms such as super bad derealization. Started having bad side effects such as fatigue, brain fog, being super tired all the time even when I would sleep 10 hours a night, had eye sight problems (eyes felt like they would zoom in and out) and super bad vivid dreams, to the point where I couldnt tell what was real and what wasnt. The drug helped my panic attacks but the bad side effects weigh out the benefits of this drug so I am switching to something else.",7,25
Lexapro,"I was diagnosed with mild anxiety and IBS and put into Lexapro 6 weeks ago.  I had low levels of anxiety and IBS.  I started on 5mg for 6 week moved to 10mg 6 days ago and shortly after moving to the higher dose had 2 severe panic attacks.  In the last 5 days when on 10mg I went into a state of hysteria with symptoms including, blurred vision, hypertension, high anxiety, difficulty focusing, trouble with basic motor function, 4 panic attacks and many other severe symptoms. It's been a life of pure hell which resulted in me taking 2 days off work.  Saw my GP yesterday and she has asked that I reduce back to 5mg for 3 days then stop.  The belief is that I have had a severe reaction to Lexapro and that I need to stop.  I have been recommended that I stop, return to baseline and then see a psychiatrist.",2,14
Lexapro,"Decided to stop Lexapro tomorrow with my pharmacists nod. I have been a shell of myself the last 8 days I've been on this drug. Can't eat, can't sleep. Anxiety is a million times worse. I even feel depressed and literally have to force myself to do anything. This drug has debilitated me completely. These side effects  were immediate, I gave it a week to see if there were any changes, but no. I wouldn't wish this feeling on my worst enemy. I'll be dealing with my anxiety naturally from now on.",1,19
Lexapro,"After enduring a high pressured job for many years, I succumbed to overwhelming Anxiety in middle age. I was first prescribed Effexor XR, the first two weeks were awful but finally the bad side effects started to dissipate albeit my anxiety was still raised. However more worryingly I had continuing insomnia. My Doc switched me seamlessly to Lexapro with no issues other than the continuing raised anxiety. I started on 5mg for a week and this was raised to 10mg but the raised anxiety was still present. I asked the Doc to raise me to 15mg and for the first two weeks the anxiety was still present until finally it abated. One month later, I'm sleeping by myself and back feeling like to my old self. I have motivation again and am returning to the work force. I posted this because frankly the negative reviews on the net scared me senseless.",9,89
Lexapro,"Woke up one day with the worst anxiety and got depressed it was horrible it lasted 3 months. My doctor told me about Lexapro and I was like hell no! But I was getting worst, lost a lot of weight felt horrible was crying all day so I decided to take lexapro 10mg. I will say it saved my life, no side effects except for sweating at night time other than that I will recommend it to anybody. Its now been 4 months and I feel amazing. I feel like my old self Im now in 5mg and eventually will be off of it l.",10,38
Lexapro,Tried Lexapro at the smallest dosage for 5 days before quitting completely. I feel like this drug almost killed me. I lost 10 pounds in 5 days (and I only weigh 115 to begin with) and could not force food down my throat because of constant nausea. I couldnt force myself to talk or move off the couch and could not sleep no matter how exhausted I was. I have decided to deal with my anxiety attacks myself and with help from those around me rather than brain-altering chemicals.,1,20
Lexapro,"I have been taking Lexapro for 5 years now.  And what a difference. No more severe anxiety  or panic attacks.  I take 20 mg everyday and I feel great , happy and life is great !   It works great for me.  Thank you lexapro 20mg.  New York Long Island girl !",0,54
Lexapro,"I was trying to find a review like mine where I was supposed to take half a 10mg pill for a month first but after one half pill I had so many bad side effects like really bad headache, flu like stuffy nose symptoms. I called my doctor and he told me to take a quarter of this pill once a day instead of the half. I did and I feel calm and balanced a noticeable difference so I am so happy because after the half pill episode and feeling so bad and so miserable I did feel like giving up on this medication. I'm so glad I took a breath and listened to the doctor to try  quarter per day. Hard as heck to cut to make a quarter pill lol but I manage. I am truly feeling very balanced. I am being treated for anxiety of PTSD. I hope my experience helps someone who may get horrible side effects right like I did. Try a quarter of pill in stead of the half of pill and then after a month take a half pill &amp; so on.",10,56
Lexapro,"Week 1 on Lexapro I started out on 5mg and had blurry vision, inability to concentrate, feeling very hot, difficult sleep and waking not feeling rested. A complete inability to climax also. Was barely able to do my job. Side effects were tapering by the weekend and I moved up to 10mg (my intended dose) and day 1 was OK just much less appetite. Day 2 I was unable to get out of bed before 3pm, think or eat. Could barely see. Couldn't function effectively in any way. Barely able to get out of bed, much less do my job or even talk to my kids and wife. All side effects got much much worse, combined with my inability to function stressing me out.  All this did was make everything worse including the return of really dark thoughts that I'd not had for years. 24/7 anxiety like I've just had my life threatened was better than Lexapro and all its side effects.",1,11
Lexapro,"Hi, I never leave reviews on the internet but wanted to help anyone who has just started this medication. I have suffered chronic anxiety for the last 8 years everyday. Rapid heart rate, churning stomach and constant worry. I have taken valium and ativan on and off. After starting this medication as a safer long term option 3 weeks ago I was doubtful it would do anything. I was looking up peoples reviews constantly which are very mixed. I have been taking this medication every morning at the same time and can say with all honesty I have noticed a big difference in the last 4 days. I'm sleeping better, my anxiety level has gone from an 8 to 3. People are correct who have said here it won't cure you but it really helps you be able to manage normal day to day activities. If your side effects are manageable give it  1 month to notice any big improvements, hopefully it will work if taken correctly.",8,54
Lexapro,"Was on lexapro two years old for largely physical symptoms of anxiety, loss of appetite, fatigue, nausea and knot in stomach stuff. Got minimum side effects except for hot flushes and sleep disturbances but that went away after a couple of weeks. Stopped lexapro after 9 months tapering off. Now back on it again and it took about 3 weeks to feel the benefits. Have up and downs but it worked for me again and I am largely free of the physical symptoms. 10mgs at the moment but may go to 15mgs. Being taking it for 6 weeks now.",10,23
Lexapro,"I've been suffering from  an extreme  health anxiety for the last few years. I've tired a lot of different medication and nothing really helped . I've visited ER sooo many times ..I  thought that something is wrong with me.  Psychosomatic symptoms felt super  real. I'd checked my cardiovascular health with cardiologist multiple times. After a check up I felt ok for a couple of weeks and then I'd started to feel bad again and went back for a check up. I've stopped drinking coffee and exercise because I was scared of a heart attack !  I was put on Lexapro. The first week was unbearable, anxiety worst than ever, but after that I've started getting better and better and two weeks later I was feeling amazing! No more obsessive thoughts about health, I became sociable and fun again , got my life back..  I definitely recommend lexapro.  It's gonna be bad for  a week or so .. but it is absolutely worth it .",10,96
Lexapro,"Lexapro has saved my life .  I tried all the natural stuff but nothing really works. Im now up to 20mg. 5mg worked at first. I did have insomnia the first week I started it but that went away. Once it fully kicks in its like the darkness, depression, and anxiety are lifted and you can see clearly.  Ive been through some hard times as a single mom struggling with money and court cases and loneliness. I was suicidal until I increased to 20mg a couple months ago.   I hope I dont have to increase again, but Im not sure if I would be alive without it.  I was able to keep working and function living a normal life again. Give the medicine 3 weeks to a month to kick in. I wasnt able to be alone or take care of my child because I was doing so bad. Now we are living alone and living a normal life. For those of you in it right nowknow that things will get better. The darkness and the fear are not permanent.   Lexapro with exercise and journaling and meditation can do wonders.",9,79
Lexapro,"This drug Lexapro took me from a place where I wasnt able to function properly in daily life to giving me my life and joy back in the space of 8 weeks. It takes time to work and not everyone will see the same benefits. My anxiety was largely physical, I was generally calm in my mind but would get complete physical anxiety, butterflys in my stomach, no appetite at all, couldnt sleep, always feeling uncomfortable and edgy, and it has largely taken that away for me now and I can enjoy life. Only side effect is some minor sleep disturbances but I counter that by taking seroquel to put me to bed. Taking 15 mg.",9,29
Lexapro,Utter garbage.  Just wanted to sleep and hide away from life. Inactivity resulted in 2 stone wait gain. Overrated and did absolutely nothing for anxiety despite being on 20mg. Great for contraception..you can't have proper sex. The only drug I have ever been on where I actually felt better not taking it.,1,17
Lexapro,"I am 62 year old male and have been taking 10 Mg of Lexapro for 7 weeks and have been experiencing a myriad of side effects.  I have had mild headaches, teeth aches, gas that could launch a small rocket, heart burn, loss of libido, inability to ejaculate, extremely sleepy shortly after taking, I have gained about 10 lbs in 7 weeks due to eating everything in sight.  While my family says my mood has improved, I personally do not see or feel enough of an improvement to put up with all these side effects.",0,23
Lexapro,"A trauma resulted in acute PTSD-related panic attacks and anxiety. I put up with this for 10 days and then started Lexapro 10mg. I experienced increased anxiety, dry mouth, clenched jaw, muscle twitches, feeling of having to pee, nose bleed, insomnia, headaches, and stomach aches. I still had anxiety attacks. I eventually increased the dose which was hard on me and caused suicidal thoughts for about 3 days.  I was on Lexapro for a total of 3 months and felt better but was still having some anxiety attacks. I decided to switch to Celexa 20 mg. I have been on Celexa for 3.5 months now. No anxiety attacks and able to do everything I did before. Unsure if this is due to time evolving since my trauma or the medication. I have a general sadness some days. I definitely am in a way better spot than 6 months ago. You don't always think you are getting better in the moment but if you look at the big picture and compare to how you felt 1 month ago/2 months ago etc you will notice improvements.",8,17
Lexapro,"Started 5mg Lexapro for 2 weeks, and had pelvic pain for 4 days, and daily headaches.  Tried 10mg, big mistake, felt awful all day, went back down to 5mg, for a few day, then 2.5 for a few days, now 2.5mg every other day, and will stop taking it.  As I have migraines, insomnia, neck pain, and now a new diagnosis of primary cough headache, the neurologist suggested Amitriptyline.  So I will try it after I'm done tapering off the Lexapro.  I really wanted it to work, but I've been taking OTC meds for the headaches everyday which wasn't good.",0,7

Lexapro,Lexapro (cipralex) is effective for my social anxiety.,7,16
Lexapro,"I havent been on Lexapro long, but it has cured my insomnia within 7 days. I take 10 mg 4 hours before ideal bedtime. I havent had severe side effects - my side effects were: was waking mid-night the first few nights, had bad heart burn, digestive issues, and vomited once. All of those side effects went away fairly quickly.  Stressed induced IBS went away/reduced within 1.5 weeks. Anxiety is reducing. Depressed feelings lifting. I feel a bit jittery ~60 minutes after taking but that may subside/is tolerable. Would highly suggest this medication, stick with it for a few weeks because initial side effects are normal. I have been told 1-2 months for full effects.",10,29
Lexapro,"Started taking lexapro at 10mg. Was than increased to 20mg. I can say it has help my depression a lot. I think that it gives me a bit of short term memory loss but this is great for anxiety (social anxiety) and depression because if I get vivid thoughts, I forget them fast and am able to concentrate on something else; this makes me able not keep bring up bad thoughts which was one of the biggest struggles for me. Amazing antidepressant I recommended it especially for social anxiety/generalized anxiety. I'm very happy with it. Only downfall is the side effects which only lasts the first 1-2 weeks.",9,30
Lexapro,"I have had anxiety and depression since puberty (I am now 32). Over the years my depression has subsided and my anxiety gotten worse. I had always avoided antidepressants because I wanted to exhaust more holistic approaches before having to take a maintenance medication. Eventually it got to a point where I realized I was doing everything I could (exercise, eating well, meditation, drinking less, sleeping 7-9 hours a night) and was still suffering. My GP put me on 10 MG of Lexapro and I can absolutely say I am much better than I was before. My anxiety is significantly more manageable and I am definitely more confident. I did have side effects for the first 4-6 weeks (fatigue and night sweats) but they subsided and I think it was worth it. I am glad I finally made the decision to go on an antidepressant and for me, Lexapro was the right choice.",8,37
Lexapro,"Absolutely destroyed my stomach. When I eat just a carrot my stomach bloats to 3x it's normal size. I have a flat stomach and I'm fit so it isn't comfortable at all. It also hasn't helped with my PTSD, anxiety, or depression. I have felt no difference in my symptoms.",1,10
Lexapro,"I have been taking Lexapro for about 2 months now. I started taking it to treat my worsening anxiety due to stress, school, family, etc. After a few weeks of taking it my anxiety was a lot better I was more calm, peaceful, etc. But I started becoming tired all the time and super unmotivated and lack of enjoyment in the things I once loved. Then I started realizing how much more depressed I was becoming. I am still taking Lexapro but now my depression is worsening I have suffered from depression in the past and while Lexapro has helped my anxiety it has made me extremely depressed.",3,24
Lexapro,"Had terrible breathing that was a little bit of asthma but seemed a lot worse than it was, the breathing problems could last hours or multiple days at times and would come and go, sometimes would end up in full can't breathe panic attacks, actually thought it was anxiety because of this before a diagnosis.  Had a chest x-ray, spirometry and bloods done to make sure there was nothing sinister and then put on Zoloft 50 mg, which I think may have been too much too quick, and this caused me to go into a near manic, panicked and upset state for about two weeks until I went back to the doctor and said that zoloft had taken a breathing anxiety condition to a crying, manic and nearly considering admitting myself state.  He changed me to 20 mg Lexapro and I must say I began to settle. Give it at least 4 weeks people, be brave in the early days when you think you are losing it, it will get better, I thought I was going to lose it in the first weeks, it was a very dark time.",8,61
Lexapro,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for most of my whole life and always wanted to stay away from prescription drugs and always tried to reduce my anxiety with exercise, medetation, etc. it took me moving cities and having a few anxiety attacks to try lexapro 6 months ago and ever since my life has been so much more calm and even. I still get anxiety sometimes but its a healthy amount and I dont hardly worry about things that arent a big issue in my life.  My only problem with the drug is the drowsiness and the crazy vivid dreams but otherwise its been great!",9,29
Lexapro,"I've had bad anxiety (mostly social anxiety) for as long as I can remember, and taking this medication has finally allowed me to function. I started on 5 mg I think, and the only annoying thing when I started was I was tired and yawning all the time, but once my body got used to it, it didn't make me tired anymore. I now take 10 milligrams, and I did try taking 15 because I still had depression, but at 15 it seemed like I was just getting side effects without added effectiveness. I'm going to be trying a different medication just because my depression has been kicking my butt, but this did work for my anxiety.",7,30
Lexapro,"STAY AWAY FROM LEXAPRO!! I started taking 5mg Lexapro 4 months ago. Starting the medication was rough, I experienced every terrible side effect it could offer. The worst was depression. I began Lexapro because of panic and anxiety, Id NEVER had a depressed thought in my life before taking this. After 3 weeks, I started to feel a little better and my anxiety was under control. Fast forward to now - I am absolutely miserable! Ive never had an issue sleeping and now I have extreme insomnia. My anxiety and panic attacks are back and worse than before. My head hurts, to the point of almost feeling like I have a brain tumor. I have zero motivation for life, which has made me a completely different person than I was before taking this medication. Taking Lexapro was the WORST decision Ive ever made. Dont risk it.",1,28
Lexapro,"I've been on 10mg for about a week for GAD. I didn't think it would work as I've always associated with anti-depressants with, well, depression, which I no longer suffer from. I've been using Ativan for breakthrough anxiety off and on for over ten years. It works great, but I have to wait for it to kick in after my body has already started going into panic mode, which can take up to an hour, and up until a week ago. I had been taking it almost every day because my panic levels have been through the roof. Thankfully, I haven't had to take any Ativan since I started on Lexapro. It literally started working from day one. I've been lucky so far as I've not had any of the adverse side effects that some people have, and I've slept like a baby since I started this medication, which is nuts because I haven't been able to sleep the whole night through in years. I'm hoping I won't have to be on this for the rest of my life, but I'm happy to be on it right now as it's already worked miracles.",10,57
Lexapro,"Had lots of freak outs the first 3 weeks on lexapro for my anxiety.  It was just my anxiety scaring me thinking anything that was happening to me was the medication. I was given this for my anxiety due to postpartum anxiety and also it may coincide with depression from my moms death 2 years ago . Anxiety caused me panic attacks which ceased to exist after about 1 month on it, worked better after 7 weeks . Im  able to get up out of bed , enjoy a movie ,laugh and organize things . I look back at these unrealistic worries I had and laugh at them now . I still have some off days but theyre not nearly as much as before .I was to paranoid to drink caffeine and now Im drinking coffee again . Yes I had some funny phobias and Im in a better place now .  I give an 8 cause it has a couple minor side effects but nothing I wanna note since I know people with anxiety will be reading this and theyre not big deals.  Lexapro 10 mg for 3 months now and yes it really works for anxiety. Generic version Escitalopram",8,72
Lexapro,"I have been on Lexapro for around 3 months. I keep waiting for it to get better. Lexapro is very effective against my anxiety, my stress level is way lower.. Lexapro make me a very calm person and more social. However, the side effects are the big problem that do not get better with time and with a reduce dosage. I can sleep for 12 hrs a day and woke up feeling drunk, headache, tired and nausea. I have tried reducing the dosage from 10mg to 7.5 then 5mg but to no avail, with the advice from my psychiatrist. I feel tired all the time with no motivation and Lexapro lower my metabolism, I gain 4kg after 3 months on this medication, I can tell that I feel less hot and sweat a lot less, that is why I am sure that it affected my metabolism. I believe that after 3 months of lexapro with several dosage changed and tried taking it in the morning or before bed, it has made no different with the serious side effect that I described earlier.",5,8
Lexapro,"I have been on Lexapro for approximately 2 weeks and have already noticed a great improvement. Prior to taking the medication, I felt high levels of anxiety that would especially interfere with my ability to concentrate during class. The first few days, I experienced some insomnia and kept waking up frequently throughout the night. DONT LET THIS STOP YOU FROM CONTINUING IT. The unpleasant side effect wore off very quickly. As of now, my level of anxiety has significantly decreased. I feel much more confident socializing and can finally concentrate. The ONLY problem is feeling very tired and lethargic, which I think is a much better alternative to feeling anxious all the time because you are at ease.  I am glad I did not listen to the negative reviews even though I was very scared at first!",9,65
Lexapro,My doctors just put me on Lexapro and I cannot believe how much better I feel.  I had been on Xanax for years and no other doctor suggested I get off of this.  I am 77 years old and he told me at my age it was serious.  I do take 1 Xanax in the morning but I am going to get off completely soon.  I have had trigger point pain since 2017 and it is hard to get treated for this.  Have tried so many outlets and hope to try one more doctor for this pain.,0,25
Lexapro,I was so anxious to try this medication. I was on 5 mg for a week and then started ten mg after. Let me tell you. I would NOT have gotten through my breakup without this drug!!! Its really made me SO much calmer. I just dont care about some things anymore. I feel so much more at ease. My health anxiety is not bad at all anymore!!!!!!!! I love this medicine. Probably never going off. Thank you lexapro for making me feel sane and calm again!,9,66
Lexapro,"Lexapro is terrible for me. I have been switched from celexa after many years and at the high end of the scale 60mg daily. Having no problems at all, doctors changed me to lexapro, hate it. Agitation increase, dizziness that was so bad I could not move my head, anxiety increase, moody, snappy, not good. Called doc immediately put back on celexa. They claim they are the same med not in my experience.",1,10
Lexapro,I suffer from anxiety and depression. I was in a bad car accident suffered a really bad concussion. Days after my car accident I had more anxiety and not sleeping and mood swings and wouldn't leave my house. I was afraid of everything. Everyone told me I have PTSD. So my dr told me to try this. It's my second day and I'm happy. I'm excited for tomorrow and I never was excited about anything. I was so depressed and thought I was worthless and ugly and I don't deserve anything. But I can say that lexapro has help me see things positive. I'm happy finally. I finally feel good again.,4,29
Lexapro,"Literally had one foot off the bridge.  I have suffered from a heart arrhythmia that was causing me to just give up on life. I was on a beta blocker for it and the beta blocker intensified the depression.  My two kiddos were the only thing keeping me in the game. No one of course knew this...but I was one foot off the bridge with my kids holding my other foot firmly planted. Then came lexapro.  I had tried it a year or so before and gave up on it...too soon. Told my doctor I had to try something.  It was like my body remembered the Lexapro I swear to God.  About 10 days after taking it, it was like a switch flipped.  I woke up feeling better. The heart arrhythmia stopped for the most part and the depression was almost lifted. I take 10mg daily.  I would rate this a 20 if I could",10,82
Lexapro,"Like you, Ive been reading these reviews over and over and over again and was just so incredulous that this drug could fix my issues. I had horrific social and generalized anxiety. I was self conscious of my voice 24/7, would ruin every experience. 24/7 negative self talk. It was awful. Started with Prozac and had to switch to Lex. Everything took about six weeks to kick in, so be patient. I thought I was hopeless, but Im laughing, smiling, feel worry slowly dripping away by the day. Social anxiety is lower every day. I feel confident. I feel like who I was mean to to be. My best piece of advice is to not obsess about whether or not its working. You WILL know when it does, trust me. Maybe lexapro isnt for you, if thats the case, DON'T WORRY you WILL find something that works for you and it will be so worth it. Hang in there and dont give up!!",10,141
Lexapro,I had problems with severe panic attacks and my GP decided to have me try this. It worked like a charm in that the ruminations were gone and my anxiety decreased greatly (although never disappeared). However the side effects made me stop taking it - mostly weight gain.,6,18
Lexapro,"I was on  20 mg Lexapro for about three years for anxiety and severe panic attacks. It worked very well. I went off it recently for about 6 months, having done a lot of therapy, learning skills to deal with my anxiety and panic. All was well until my friend committed suicide about a month ago. I started experiencing such extreme anxiety again I decided to restart my Lexapro at 10mg. Big mistake for my body. I suffered the most extreme panic and adrenaline rushes Ive ever felt. I thought I was dying, was vomiting, had diarrhea, my legs were shaking, and I had no ability to regulate my emotions. I felt as I was going crazy and it left me on my bathroom floor moaning for days. Terrible terrible side effects. A precautionary tale, if you know youre sensitive to meds, start this drug on a very low dose to avoid serotonin overload. Im on 2.5 mg now and feeling much better, will continue to slowly increase!",5,36
Lexapro,"Unfortunately lexapro did not work for me. Been on it for three years and switching to Effexor. I still felt anxious for no reason, felt down a lot and had panic attacks. I hope this new medication works better for me.",1,11
Lexapro,Unfortunately lexapro did not work for me. Took it for three years and noticed no difference. Still felt pretty down and had panic attacks. Had diarrhea a lot too. Finally switched to effexor and hope that will be a positive experience.,2,9
Lexapro,"Before starting Lexapro, I was a complete mess. GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) had completely taken over my life. I could barely go outside without having an anxiety attack. I started Lexapro 5 mg two years ago and my life completely changed. It took about 2 weeks for me to feel a difference, and I was blown away by how different my life was. I was going to concerts, traveling, doing things I never thought I would be able to do with my level of anxiety. I switched off Lexapro to try a new drug recently to see if it would work better, but it made my anxiety worse than ever. Thankfully I started Lexapro again last week and I already feel so much better. This drug honestly saved my life and even though everyone is different, I would completely recommend trying it if you have GAD. The side effects (for me) were mild, only some insomnia and a little dizziness, so I would say if your starting it to wait a week or so, and youll feel a difference. I hope my review helps!",10,101
Lexapro,"I suffer from panic attacks, partial agoraphobia, the whole pack of anxiety. The first therapy I tried was Stablon, my experience was not positive with this drug. Yesterday I took only a quarter of Lexapro, that's my doctor's suggestion. I thought it was impossible to feel such a low dose so I did not feel any fear, actually I heard very good reviews for Lexapro. After an hour I felt a bit tired, as if everything slowed me down for a second and it took hours. I was not scared because it was not very scary but a pretty uncomfortable. I was lying on the bed and got a terribly dizzy, literally like I was on a boat, my room swinging right and left and all the time I had the feeling that I would fall because the dizziness became unmanageable. I can not lower my head, everything turns. I had headaches all day, but it's bearable. I feel slow to lose coordination and I do not want to walk too much, besides having terribly strong muscular pain, mostly in my legs and back.",1,10
Lexapro,"I started Lexapro 5 weeks ago for anxiety and panic disorder I started with the 5mg and 2 weeks ago my doctor prescribed me the 10mg , in November of this year I get sick with anxiety that on Thanksgiving day I was screaming and crying because of the anxiety and I though it was the end of my life. I couldn't go out. I thought I was going to lose my mind and my life. Then I when to see the doctor the day after Thanksgiving and she prescribed me Lexapro 5 mg the first week. I feel so sick (light headed nauseous anxious etc)  but I read the reviews and everyone says that is normal and to stay strong and wait so I kept taking it. On second week I was able to eat and sometimes go out. Then on 3 week the panic attacks were almost gone. On the 4th week I was able to have at least a descent Christmas day with my kids and that make me so happy. I am on week 5 and I am able to go out a little more. So if you suffer from anxiety and panic attacks I highly recommend this med and please don't give up to soon it takes up to 5 weeks to work",8,36
Lexapro,I have been taking Lexapro for about two and a half weeks for OCD and anxiety. I have noticed me being calm on the outside and around everyone I talk to says I seem not so anxious. But inside its like I am exploding like something went off - my OCD is awful I can't tell you how many times I have washed my hands and my anxiety is the worst it has been in awhile. I don't know if it is because for maybe 5 years I have pushing my OCD and anxiety aside in my mind and not letting it bother me mentally but I was more anxious with my actions and words. I didn't have time to be OCD with working 12 hour shifts and being a full time student online and a mother. But now college has a two week break for Christmas and I am in the process of moving so I have been out of work for about a couple weeks. And I am a mess inside but doing great on the outside. I am trying to hang in there for the full 6 to 8 weeks. I just don't know if this is normal. But I fell like I am just screaming on the inside.,5,13
Lexapro,"My experience w/Lexapro was so traumatizing I had to share. I suffer from GAD(mostly Social Anxiety) &amp; decided to seek help when my SA got to its worst point. The dose for this med is 10mg/20mg daily depending on your condition. Being my first SSRI I have ever tried, I started at 5mg dose: 3 hrs after my first dose, I felt disassociated from reality &amp; completely numb mentally/physically. Dilated pupils. Thought I was going to DIE in my sleep that night: I was SHAKEN AWAKE twice during the night from brain zaps,short seizures,shaking. Electric shock in my brain that jolted through my entire body. Absolutely TERRIFYING...&amp; this is from ONE 5mg DOSE!! The following days I had the worst dry mouth/nausea/constipation/insomnia. So numb &amp; disconnected, I started fantasizing about bleeding out. By day 5 I started to get double vision/blurry/shaky eyes. TLDR; STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG!!!! BET I WOULD'VE DIED IF I TOOK MORE!!!!",1,14
Lexapro,"I have suffering with Severe OCD, it had severely impacted almost every single aspect of my life which lead to severe anxiety that was utterly crippling, social anxiety, panic disorder and mild depression. I tried numerous types of medication, even the BIG ONE - Anafranil, I remained on this medication for several months on a high dosage, it assisted with the OCD (not so much with Anxiety) however the side effects were utterly terrible so decided to give it up. My psychiatrist suggested Lexapro, began on 5mg and slowly work my way up to 30mg (currently on this dosage for the last three months). Pros: Anxiety has GREATLY REDUCED, very few panic attacks, hasn't stopped the thoughts however they have become much easier to brush off, I am able to think more rationally, and I feel somewhat more hopeful and optimistic. Cons: Constantly tired, extremely sleepy (I could sleep all day if I wanted to), I feel somewhat emotionally numb.",9,36
Lexapro,"I started first on 2.5 mg, after 1 month 5 mg and now I taking 10 mg.  It the  best medication, had couple days aide effect (teeth pain) you need time for it to work and it  does work.It's really cool for anxiety and depression plus body discomfort, just do the dose increases slowly and it works.",9,22
Lexapro,"My doctor put me on lexapro 10mg for anxiety and occasional panic attacks.  After the first day, and I mean ONE 10mg pill I had dilated pupils,  vision changes- everything I looked at seemed like it would zoom in and out, made my anxiety worse, and I had crying spells where I would cry and cry for no reason",1,7
Lexapro,"Please give it a try! It works! Here are some recommendations based on my experience. It won't fix you, but it'll make it so you can actually breathe again. I used to cry constantly, isolate myself, have panic attacks so frequently I couldn't even sleep, and have horrible intrusive violent thoughts.  1. be proactive when it comes to the nausea side effect. Eat BEFORE you take the pill, and don't let yourself get hungry during the first 3-4 hours after you take the pill. Because once you get nausea it becomes harder to eat, which only makes you more nauseous. It's a vicious cycle that can be prevented. 2. ignore the negative reviews that are like I took this pill for 1 day and it caused *terrifying side effects*. They only cause more anxiety and they're highly unlikely.  3. From my personal experience, the first things to get better were the physical symptoms of anxiety. Less panic attacks, more hungry, less crying, etc. Keeping a journal is helpful to see the progression.",9,104
Lexapro,"Psychiatrist has been having me take it for the last 11 years and at first had no problem and now I have near daily panic attacks and they want to put me on more meds. Not a great med (and not a great psychiatrist) also if I miss my dose by 3 or 4 hours, I have extremely intense withdrawal symptoms",2,10
Lexapro,"I'll share my experience with lexapro so far. I've been on it for a month now, before starting it I couldn't work, had daily panic attacks, social phobia and derealization. It was awful, truly. I started on 10mg and had awful side effects, felt weird, insomnia, nausea, diarrhea, increased anxiety! You name it. So I went down to 5mg, that was fine and no side affects at all. Although my anxiety was better it wasn't gone. I upped to 7.5mg and did that for a bit. No side affects. I have to mention that I do take my lexapro at night time because it still makes me very sleepy. But I sleep through that obviously. I am now on 10mg after the gradual upping and I have to say, my anxiety is nearly completely gone! I feel like myself again and work (I work in emerge at a hospital) has been great. I am only assuming it will get even better in a month. I know when you start the side affects can be hard and you will want to stop. All I can say is hold out!",10,75
Lexapro,"I am back to write an update on my almost 5 month journey on Lexapro. I am feeling great, and have a lot of positive things to say. I am starting back nursing school (to specialize in psychiatry, of all things!) this January after quitting due to my mental breakdown. I am back to working fulltime. I'm calm, and feel mentally able to  achieve what I want in my life. The OCD rituals are a bare minimum now, and the horrible mood swings I had before starting Lexapro have almost completely disappeared. My anxiety and depression once had me homebound, and now I'm leaving my house 4-6 days a week, and I enjoy being out again. I'm 24 and have struggled with mental health problems since the age of 12, and thought I was doomed for life. Your life can turn around for good, so don't give up on yourself. Prayers for you all that you find happiness and live your lives to your fullest potentials. Be blessed.",9,102
Lexapro,I was very hesitant to try any medicine for my persistent anxiety and low grade depression (30+ years of drudgery). I finally called uncle when it was clear that I would literally not make it through without additional help. I went to the doctor and balled my eyes out  as she listened patiently. She started me on 10mg which made things worst for about 2 weeks and then kicked in nicely. I felt sooooo much better. I asked the doctor to increase my dose to 20mg which she agreed to to do. There was an immediate change for the better and now after about a month on 20mg I am feeling almost no anxiety or depression. An amazing drug! Side effects are sleepiness and some loss of libido. The list of good effects are too long to list. Increased patience with the kids. Being a better husband in so many ways. I feel like I am more in control of my life instead of always trying to avoid things that were uncomfortable. I recommend Lexapro!!,10,75
Lexapro,"I started taking lexapro (10mg) for anxiety and depression. This drug took effect quickly and I felt more hopeful within the first week. After a few days I had this false sense of elation, but I eventually evened out.  I was less emotional, less moody, more focused. There were ZERO side effects.... until about three months in. My hair began falling out in massive clumps. I had visible bald spots and would wear my hair up in a bun to avoid the humiliation of having handfuls of hair fall out. After about 9 months and 40% hair loss I stopped taking this medication, with the assistance of my doctor.  It was only five months later when most of my hair grew back, but so did my anxiety. I started lexapro again and felt amazing until about four weeks in when my hair starting falling out again  I stopped taking the drug again. My doctor and I are still working to find the right rx for me.  the side effect of hair loss is very rare. I highly recommend this medication.",9,28
Lexapro,"I really hope that my review can help someone out there. Even if it only helps one person, it will be worth it to me. I just had my first child in the month of April and about 3 months later, I noticed something was different. I was scared to leave the house and even the most simple tasks seemed overwhelming. My thoughts were racing, I would pace back and forth, and I was having multiple panic attacks. I wanted to call the emergency room because I thought I was losing my mind! After suffering for a month, I spoke to my doctor and she prescribed me 10MG of Lexapro. I had every side effect including upset stomach, hot flashes, going to the bathroom constantly, insomnia, mood swings, shaky hands, loss of appetite, and nausea. After 3 weeks, my side effects are almost gone! My appetite is back, I don't have panic attacks anymore, and I'm not scared to leave the house! Please be patient with this medication. It takes 3-4 weeks to even BEGIN to be effective!",8,79
Lexapro,"It should be in the drinking water. I've been on lexapro for 3 years. In the beginning, I had very very vivid dreams (loved that part), but it didn't last long. I made the mistake of drinking alcohol, which really, really didn't mix well with me. It made me even more extreme in my thoughts, plans, compulsions. Once I put the wine away for good, I slowly woke up and something snuck up on me: peace. I just don't experience the irrational worry and fear anymore.  I don't want to yell and scream anymore. The world  is a better place now.",10,62
Lexapro,"People!! It takes about 4-6 weeks to work!!!!! Dont write a review when the drug has not settled and began to give you the therapeutic benefits yet!  2-3 weeks  into taking it, I felt rubbish, worst anxiety of my life, then pop, after about 4-5 weeks I feel the best I have felt in YEARS. I feel relaxed, calm and ready to take on the world, live my life like a normal person.  Ive suffered extremely bad anxiety, stress and panic attacks for over a decade, finally decided to try a regular medication, not just take a Xanax when I feel it coming on.  This medication I understand may not work for everyone, but at LEAST if   you can, give it 6 weeks and commit to it if youre going to try it.  Changed my life.  I will say tho, the first month was bad anxiety, headaches, naps in the afternoon and just horrible. Prescribed Xanax to deal with the side effects for the first few weeks, then once it settles, no side effects, just a calm and peaceful mind. Thank you.",10,110
Lexapro,"I took 15mg in 2014 for over half a year. It did not do a thing against my anxiety it even caused me to not being interested in people anymore, unable to receive love, unable to feel my surroundings. It destroyed my: sleep (10 hours wasn't enough). My muscles got destroyed and I felt very weak till this day I'm not fully recovered. It caused heavy brain fog (till this day not fully disappeared...",1,11
Lexapro,I started taking Lexapro 5 mg everyday for 3 weeks. At  a very low dose my anxiety was unbearable by the end of the third week. It might work for some just not for me. I am on Buspirone now just started it today so no feed back yet.,1,7
Lexapro,"I have been on Lexapro 5mg (7 days at beginning) and upped to 10mg almost two weeks ago (for depression and anxiety)  Straight away I had very vivid dreams and dry mouth, when I upped to 10mg I became increasingly anxious and emotionally unstable I am not able to stop crying and panicking at every situation. My paranoid racing thoughts were uncontrollable and disturbing, making me think all my close friends and family were turning against me (prior to medication my anxious thoughts often surrounded the idea that nobody loved me and were only pretending) Just wondering how long this side effect will last as its really negatively impacting my life and overwhelming me and ruining my relationship and self esteem",5,16
Lexapro,I have been taking this a few months. The 10mg worked well for anxiety and depression but eventually the 10mg wasn't enough so I was moved to 20 which helped for a bit but stopped and my energy was extremely low on the 10mg and 20mg. So we moved in a SNRI which helped a lot and just upped the dose of that. I do have to say lexapro works very good for anxiety. No other side effects besides being tired but some people don't get that.,8,19
Lexapro,"I never had an issue with anxiety until I turned 26. It was like a switch went off in my head and I had a panic attack that ended up with me in the ER. I had no idea what was happening to me. I didn't want to go on medication because I was ashamed that I couldn't cope by myself. Eventually I broke down and decided I was going to lose my job, house, and life if I didn't get some help. The first few weeks of Lexapro were horrible, but listen to me when I say to stick with it. I had every side effect in the book and felt like I had the flu for three weeks. I am now on week 10 and have never felt better. I finally feel like my old self again and I can honestly say that this medicine saved me! I pray for everyone suffering from this disease. Know that you WILL get better. God speed my friends.",10,120
Lexapro,"I have been on Lexapro for nine days.  I was on Prozac only five before that. I have been very queasy  or nauseated ever since I started the SSRIs. Its mainly the first half of the day.  At night it tends to go away.   Has anyone experienced this with these drugs and will it subside at some point.  Is there anything to help with the nausea I have tried several things. Every day is so hard when you are sick all day, I also tremble in my hands unless I take Klonopin which I try not to use much.  Thanks for any help.",0,14
Lexapro,"After years of battling depression, anxiety and insomnia I finally broke down and went to the doctor again. This time determined to ride out the horrible side effects and actually let it work. I didn't want to be on medication and most cause weight gain, which was a big part of why I fought it so long. But Lexapro was the right choice for me. Getting through the adjustment period was rough, but in about 3 weeks I was feeling notably better. Still on 5mg and will stay on this dose as long as possible. It has been 2 months and I have gained a couple pounds, but I have also been very undisciplined with my eating. Stick with it, good luck!",10,31
Lexapro,"I was depressed because of my anxiety. I started taking Lexapro 9 weeks ago and feel the depression lifted, but going places (my trigger for the anxiety) is still there. My doctor tells me to hang in there. And I am. But I'm not sure it's helping with my anxiety. I rarely leave the house. I hope something switches soon. I need to take something for my anxiety and that alone. Lexapro works for depression part. Has anyone found a well-working medication for just anxiety? Because that is what I need.",7,14
Lexapro,"I have just started my round of Auro-Escitalopram and I am on day 5 of my 5mg half-tab before going on a full 10mg tablet. I take my medication at night time. The first 3 days were sort of rough; I felt different. I could not put my finger on why but I felt a bit sedated, a little odd and definitely felt  drugged . I had a mild headache, some dizziness and I felt like I was going to faint. My appetite has diminished, my stomach was upset, I am also gassy and had some dry mouth. The first 3 nights I was also met with mild restlessness and it was hard for me to sleep longer than 5 hours. I woke up at 3AM and was peeing like crazy. With that being said, the side effects have subsided somewhat after day 5 and I am starting to notice that I can start to control my racing thoughts. I get tired at bed time like a normal human being and I can finally wake up in the morning without feeling like a zombie.",8,36
Lexapro,"I have started cipralex for the first time on 2013 and I was very tired suffering from severe anxiety causing me very depressed .  My dose was 5mg for two weeks, 10mg for month 20mg for year then 10mg again and I stayed on 10 mg for 4 years and it was life saving. After that I decided to stop medication because I thought that I am well.  It was 6 months after that that I had a severe relapse. I thought that this time I will not be able to survive again because I started again but for three month no relief, I was very tired and exhausted and drained out of any type of energy but I decided to stick with it reading reviews here. After 4months I started feeling some relief but not total well as the previous time. So I decided to do some tests with my doctor and he told that B12 level in my blood was only 73  and that was making me very depressed And when I took B12 medication it was like magic.  I am alive again Cipralex start working.",10,16
Lexapro,"I was on this for 3 weeks and could feel it helping my anxiety, but it made me pee constantly and I was getting up 3-5 times every night to pee. Every single night. It was like my bladder was never fully empty. Obviously this was majorly affecting my sleep. It also gave me terrible gas, like the worst of my life. For these reasons, I had to stop taking it.  Im surprised I havent read more reviews with similar symptoms.",6,21
Lexapro,"I started the medication due to panic attacks and anxiety. Initially I had much worsening anxiety and depression. I had improvement in anxiety symptoms after about 3 weeks. HOWEVER I was very ill and bedridden. My mind was calm but also I did not want to do anything. I didn't care about anything. I lost my car, my home, my job - everything because I didn't care! I was always sleepy and could sleep 14 hours straight. I had major sexual dysfunction at 26 years. I tapered off slowly after about 8 weeks. I was left with constant dizziness weeks after to the point that I fell down the stairs.  Over a month after stopping, I'm doing well. No meds. Just making positive changes and counselling and trying to get back everything I lost in a couple of months on this med. I still have a little anxiety but I'm learning to control it. Gotta control it or it'll control you! I've learned that anxiety is like a bully. You have to confront it and not try to ignore it. Move TOWARD your fear! Slowly it will get better!",1,27
Lexapro,"I have suffered from anxiety for a very long time and I always had stigma over taking medicine for it. As a 21 year old and a college student, I wasn't living my life like I should have been. I always stressing about EVERYTHING, I didn't sleep, I cried over every little inconvenience, I could never wind down and take a nap for example, I was always agitated, had rapid heart beat, and so much more. I wasn't living, I was suffering. I finally took the decision to take Lexapro and at first; the side effects weren't pleasurable I will say that. But after a week, they started going away and I could tell I was getting better. It is now about 6 weeks in or more, I can notice a huge improvement. I'm much more calm and I am so much happier. If you are on the fence on taking this medication, I would still do it and try. It has helped me and honestly, saved my life for the better.",10,49
Lexapro,"22 female. Diagnosed GAD for 4 years. I've been on 10mg Lexapro for about 10 weeks now. Anxiety mostly characterized by racing thoughts, over analyzing, and overthinking. The first two weeks I had increased anxiety, and nausea. I didn't feel anything until the full two months. Its not a significant change but it takes the edge off. I have more motivation, can recognize my trailing thoughts and compulsions and stop them before they spiral out of control. I don't feel the need to make a big deal out of certain situations. I feel like I have more control and that I am gaining my life back. My anxiety was focused on my relationship at the time I started (constant overanalyzing, creating problems that don't exist, worried about making mistakes) which eventually got to the point that it was effecting my work ability. I still have some anxiety which is GOOD because I want to be able to manage it on my own. I think a lot of it is the medication and my own personal work. Overall I am very satisfied",10,25
Lexapro,I think it is working well at the moment but I am on kolopin also. I think it is  for much for same problem lexapro 20 mg an kolopin is .05 at night. What do you think.,9,4
Lexapro,"Theres no need to be suffering. This medication is an anxiety GAME CHANGER. Im on 10mg a day. I work out every day have not gained an ounce. 6 months later my sex life is thriving! When you feel better, you feel sexier. Im 47 and shocked folks are having sex issues and weight gain. Get out there and grab life!",0,80
Lexapro,"I'm making an update ( from my 5 week post) as I'm now approaching the two month mark on Lexapro. I am on 10 mg, and I'm feeling like a happier and less nervous wreck than I was 2 months ago. I feel motivated when I wake up, I'm back to working out again, I don't cry over senseless matters anymore, and I don't get angry over the smallest matters. I feel more comfortable going out in public again and holding conversations, whereas that felt impossible before starting Lexapro. I still have work I need to do outside of just taking Lexapro and expecting it to change my life, but it's given me the motivation  to help myself and not feel miserable in the process. Only con I have at this point is occasional brain fog, but I've found that keeping a consistent sleeping routine and eating healthier has helped that a lot. I hope you all feel better soon and stay encouraged that recovery is possible! You will find what works for you! Be blessed.",9,54
Lexapro,"After suffering with anxiety and panic attacks for around 25 years. The panic attacks were only getting worse. I couldnt even have a conversation with another person without getting really anxious and having to leave the situation. I had to do something, I wanted my life back! My doctor prescribed me the generic brand 5mg. I didnt want to take it because just like you reading this, the thought of taking it made me even more anxious. I started taking it July 29th. I am taking 2.5mg as of right now. I honestly felt more calm the first night I took it. The next day I just felt kinda foggy and tired. I am on day 4. It makes me nauseous, a little dizzy sometimes if I get up to fast, and it has given me gas, as well as feeling a little more anxious during the day at time. I take it at night around 9. I am going to stick it out and see what happens. Im really hoping that this medicine is what I need to get my life back.",4,20
Lexapro,"24 years of age and I've experienced chronic depression, anxiety, OCD, and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) for about the last 12 years. I have been on various medications and I can say that by taking Lexapro, I'm finally getting my life and self back. Before this medication, my OCD/BDD rituals and thoughts were consuming anywhere from 3-10 hours of my day. Since week 2 of this medication, the thoughts and rituals have been less and less. I'm on week 5, and I feel like it's helping more and more each day with anxious, obsessive thoughts and the down moods. I pray this medication continues to work for me, because I finally feel like I can be something and accomplish what I've always wanted for myself. I'm so grateful for this medication, and the very few side effects I experienced starting this drug (mild headaches, slight dizziness, and dry mouth). Overall, I'm very satisfied with this medication so far.",9,25
Lexapro,"This was the first medication I took for my anxiety and depression. When I talked to my doctor about my mental health before he prescribed this I was a lot more anxious than depressed. As I started taking it, it helped a lot. Not only I noticed a difference, but everyone around me also did, saying how much more outgoing I was, and I was. It helped with my anxiety and my depression wasnt a big issue, but as I continued to take it, my depression slowly got worse and worse. I eventually stopped going to school and missed like 3 months worth of classes, being in college this was terrible, considering most classes only allow 3-5 absences for an entire semester. Needless to say, my grades went downhill causing me to fall deeper into my depression and never leave my house. Eventually I stopped taking it and while Im still depressed and anxious, its not as bad as the Lexapro made it. So Id say for anxiety, it was a great medication, but depression wise it was absolutely terrible.",4,7
Lexapro,"I am currently just over a week in and I haven't experienced anxiety like this since my nervous breakdown 3 years ago which I spent years building up a healthy mental state after. At first I started with a quarter of a pill, then went to 5mg, then had immediate horrible anxiety the next day! As I type this I am on my 4th pill of 5mg and LIFE IS AWFUL RIGHT NOW. I also have every damned side effect in the book! Thanks Lexapro, I lost 5 kilos thanks to your free weight loss program! I am consulting my doctor about the future of this med in my life, I don't care if people say you have to wait it out 3-4 weeks... I honestly don't see hope in that happening, and also you don't know whether it will WORK or NOT after that period... not worth the ANXIETY.",1,22
Lexapro,"Got almost every side effect and not one positive thing has come from it.  The stick with it advice is rubbish for me, lexapro is a bad medicine.",1,13
Lexapro,"I resisted getting on medication for three years of suffering from major panic attacks after losing a baby. I wish I wouldve started earlier.  This has helped me so much! The first two weeks sucked I have to admit, I felt worse. But after reading everybody saying stick it out Im so glad I did. I started feeling better after a few weeks but it took a good three months to really feel balanced. I dont get panic attacks anymore but I still get occasional anxiety here in there. I dont feel like a different person at all and I want to add that I did not have depression so I dont see a difference in that at all but that was not my problem, the anxiety was. I hope this helps somebody because I did a lot of reading before I started. I was so afraid to get on medication but again I want to add I wish I wouldve done it earlier. Nothing to be ashamed about. Ive been on it for five months now.",9,57
Lexapro,Starting 4th week moved up from 5 to 7.5 and now my prescribed dose of 10mg.  Ive failed with others but think this may be the one to help with anxiety and panic attacks.  I have noticed I am much better in some situations.  The biggest problem so far is gas.  Gas like I never thought possible.  I mean big WHOMP gas.  Sometimes I dont ever know its there like standing up to get off the plane or reaching down at the water cooler.  Hopefully that will pass soon.,9,20
Lexapro,"Ive been taking 10mg for just over a year now. It has REALLY helped my overall anxiety and mood swings from perimenopause. Getting started on this was VERY tough for me. The side effects were not very pleasant and I definitely felt worse before I felt better. Klonopin helped get through the first few weeks. I would say after probably 3 months ALL the side effects were gone and I didnt feel like I was  on  anything, which was a relief! After the first 3 weeks or so MOST of the symptoms had greatly decreased/disappeared. Im glad I stuck it out and continued taking it. It has been a huge help overall and I have very little anxiety about driving places that I am unfamiliar with like I was before. There is light at the end of the tunnel. Hang in there!",0,35
Lexapro,This drug made a new person of me. I had suffered from anxiety and depression my whole life and just never knew what it felt like not to be full of anxiety. When I turned 50 I went into a severe depression and elevated anxiety.  I was started on this med while in the hospital. It took a couple of weeks to work but when it did it was like a miracle.  I am so thankul. I have taken it for the past 13 years.....,10,65
Lexapro,"I have suffered from anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, through a lot of ups and downs, I am finally feeling myself. This drug is amazing, Im usually anti-med, and the only negative side effect of this drug has been on and off nausea. My anxiety has been significantly reduced, and my depression has also seemed to have subsided greatly! I would recommend giving cipralex a chance out of any other SSRI.",9,11
Lexapro,"I started taking Lexapro a month ago. I felt it working right away, which I was told I wouldn't feel anything for 4-6 weeks. I always had non stop leg shaking and my jaw would clench tight for the first week. Forget about sex!! ughhh  that is why I am giving an 8, but I am just happy I don't have to cry every night over a box of crayons or be unfocused because the anxiety was so high.",8,9
Lexapro,I have tried this before and found some relief.  The only thing that I don't like about it is that it blunts my emotions.,8,6
Lexapro,I've battled anxiety for 40 years and finally went on 10 mg lexapro.  It works fantastic for me and after 9 months I weaned myself to 5mg a day.  That was a mistake I had panic attacks more anxiety and so went back to 10mg today.  I don't think I can ever stop taking it.,8,18
Lexapro,I wanted to share my positive experience with you.  I started taking Lexapro about 6 weeks ago. My anxiety months ago started to get away from me due to a family stress event. I have dealt with anxiety in the past so its not new for me but this time it was getting out of control.  My worries were non stop and sleep wasnt happening.  So I started Lexapro beginning of April. By the 3 rd week I was getting good relief from my anxiety.  By week 6 I was back to me. :) So hang in there. It takes time but it worked for me. And I very much hope it works for you.  Anxiety is debilitating. And hard for others to understand.  Good luck everyone.  And say some prayers too. That will get you through. ??,9,67
Lexapro,"I took Lexapro for 11 years. I started out taking 10 mg, for the first 5 years then the Doctor pumped it up to 20 mg daily.  I broke out in a rash that I could see on my stomach ,arms, and neck. I also got dermatitis on my scalp. I suffered nausea and gained 50 pounds. I went through all this because I had 2 panic attacks in my late 40s. I  decided to tapper off Lexapro to see how I felt without a antidepressant to get me through the day. Believe me, its been hard! The side effects on going off this drug has been the most worst thing I have ever gone through. I ended up in the emergency room feeling like I was dying.  I am still dealing with the effects of withdrawal symptoms but I would never take Lexapro again !",1,18
Lexapro,"If you have Bipolar, mania or any kind of mood shifting disorder, do NOT take lexapro. It can work well for most but NOT if you have a mood disorder.",5,7
Lexapro,"I have been smoking marijuana for almost 10 years until recently  when I knew that was causing me more anxiety and depression. So I broke down to my doctor and told her my head isnt right, that I messed with it for too many years. The first week of Lexapro I felt the affects right away. What a difference honestly I felt normal and could take on anything. I do believe in lifestyle change: I started 3 months ago to lose weight and I have lost 10 lbs so far. Thats because I pushed myself but was still miserable. It really is reprogramming your mind, but with the THC withdrawals Lexapro definitely saved me. Eventually I would like to get off it but its saving me a lot of trouble with suffering. Plus, its giving me so much confidence and NO more social anxiety. Its hard to say if I really do have generalized anxiety because I abused THC for a decade but right now, this medication really does help with everything else Im doing to change my life. Im on a low dosage of 5 mg which I feel is enough.",8,24
Lexapro,"Had severe depression and anxiety for a month that hit me like a ton of bricks in civil litigation with a sociopath who suddenly seemed to me to be on a sure path of bankrupting me eventually.  First two months on Lexapro had little effect.    Could barely bring myself to work with my lawyers.  Driving more than a few blocks was a mountain to climb, as was social interaction, even visits with relatives.  Dosage increased from 10 to 20mg after a couple months when it did not seem to be working.  Dropped a prescribed companion sedative that was causing me to sleep until noon. Now, after 4 month on Lexapro am back to nearly normal activities, feel the future can be positive, traveling to see relatives and friends.  The first two+ months were tough, but combined with professional counselling,  a lifesaver. And that sociopath is being successfully challenged.",9,15
Lexapro,Just go for this medicine don't think that you are like others ...anxiety and depression are chemical imbalances of brain and this is true. Do some therapy also but medication is important ..and one thing more your time is important too.. Cheers  :),9,13
Lexapro,"The best medication I found for long term anxiety management. Least amount of side effects, (dosage dependent), and fastest acting. Used klonopin to manage short term while lexapro ramped up then tapered off klonopin. After years of use have found minimum dose required to control anxiety. Best to start low dose...too much of an SSRI can increase anxiety.",10,17
Lexapro,"I started lexapro and on the 5th day I woke up wide awake. This has never happened to me and I felt so different. I get weirded out and got up to grab some water. On my way, I feel a cold sweat and my body goes completely paralyzed. I felt a fear I didn't know I was capable of feeling. I try to scream but my vocal cords are paralyzed. I wait for death, completely terrified. Then my ears start ringing and I slowly get all my senses back. I am able to breathe again and start to hyperventilate from the panic. I was exhausted after that. I got in to see my doctor ASAP. I fell asleep in the waiting room and I can normally barely fall asleep in my own bed. He told me it doesn't even do anything in the first week and was all a placebo effect and gets upset with me because I didn't want to continue it. I don't think there's appropriate education being placed on these towards medical professionals. I realize they can help but there seems to be complete denial about adverse effects.",1,13
Lexapro,"Like you, you're reaching out for hope because you're going through one of the most horrible experiences in your life. But anxiety always passes, and lexapro helps your mind heal and recover. I had bad anxiety before that turned into anxiety disorder (afraid of anxiety itself). Just know that this is your mind tricking you and you have to learn no longer to be afraid of it. Lexapro will help you break the cycle and get you out of the hole quicker. Side effects were at their peak for the first two weeks, with even sometimes worse anxiety, but each day gets better.  Sexual side effects subsided as well after the first 2-3 weeks as most are psychosomatic. Just try to remember your mind wants to calm down and its only temporary. I have been through hell and made it out the other end to see the light - just give it time and patience, it will pass and Lexapro helps.",10,64
Lexapro,"I've been on escitalopram for about 12 weeks now. I was a normal person my whole entire 20 years of life, and when anxiety hit me out of absolutely nowhere.  I  had severe derealization symptoms that basically drove my anxiety through the roof. All of a sudden, I was a completely different person; once an outgoing, lively, fearless girl to someone who couldn't even look up. Because of this I spiralled into a horrible depression. I think one of the scariest feelings was I would panic and a wave of helplessness would just hit me and I felt like my whole world was falling apart. After taking lexapro, I started to very gradually feel better. It was never like an on and off switch but as the weeks went by, I just slowly started feeling better/mood lift/less tense/etc. Now, I feel great and like myself again and am doing more for myself in the past few weeks than I have the past few years. Give it a shot, it will be rough in the beginning like everybody says, but it will be worth it.",0,27
Lexapro,"I unfortunately was one of those people who it took 4-5 weeks to see any benefit from Lexapro, but once it kicked it, it was life changing. I went from debilitating anxiety to where I couldn't even leave my house to finally feeling like the old me again. It was a slow transition, nothing black-and-white, but I can look back and see how the med slowly started to work. Side effects lasted a couple weeks and included headaches, endless fatigue, and I have to be careful what I eat because I have gained about 5 lbs., but I'd take those side effects over living in a constant dream-like state from anxiety. Started on 10 mg and am now on 15 mg. Give it a shot!",10,30
Lexapro,"I've been on lexapro 10mg for 5 days, cant tell much difference just yet. Only side effects are slight headaches from time to time (not a full blown headache), tired, decrease in appetite, had diarrhea once. Trying to stick it out. On the downside my new doctor doesnt prescribe lexapro so eventually I will have to switch to Celexa soon which I dont know how I feel about that.",2,1
Lexapro,Made me extremely tired and I could not concentrate at work.,2,2
Lexapro,"I've been taking Lexapro for 1 year and 2 months.  So far its been a life saver.  I couldn't sleep for days, stopped going to work and cried about anything that made me even the slightest bit upset.  For me anxiety is like a cock fight going on inside my head.  I also take Alprazolam for anxiety attacks, which rarely happen anymore  (once or twice a month).  I would also recommend  finding a good therapist.  Mine helps A TON.",10,13
Lexapro,I've been on 10 mg for  6 months and it definitely has calmed my anxiety issues. No side effects except weight gain about 30 lbs which I am not happy with but still worth taking,7,12
Lexapro,Ive been on this medication for about 2 weeks and Ive noticed my anxiety getting worse .. is that normal ? Will it get better ... Ive seen reviews on it getting worse before better and Im just so scared all the time I feel like Im not myself . Please someone help me to understand if I should stay on medication,6,10
Lexapro,"I've been suffering from anxiety and depression since 2017. I found myself not leaving the house, in and out of hospitals, going to so many doctors for answers, not being able to drive, or even be by myself and having panic attacks everyday  and so I was giving up. I found a therapist who helped me tremendously! He advised me to get on Lexapro. I was scared, I didn't want to take it and I felt like I was weak  I can honestly tell you I am beyond thankful that I made myself get on this medication. It has totally changed my life in such a positive way. I do have to say the first couple of weeks were rough for me. I was dizzy, nauseous, just all the way felt like rubbish BUT STICK IT OUT. I am so thankful. Give this medicine a try but always remember you have to change the way you live your life and your thoughts, always be positive and always remember you will get out of this and you can live a happy and healthy life.",10,61
Lexapro,"I am a 50 year old male in a highly stressful professional occupation.  I became stricken with severe work related anxiety making me irritable and agonizing over decisions or interacting with others.  Lexapro 10mg saved my career, as I was at the point that I believed I could no longer continue to function at work.  The first few days were rough, but after 5 days, I remember waking up and feeling like the anxiety has diminished substantially.  My anxiety continued to diminish gradually and now, after being on this medication for 1 year, I feel great.  Only side effect is lasting longer...no complaints from the wife.  I was hesitant to take the pharmaceutical route and felt real men should tough it out...so stupid.",10,52
Lexapro,"I tried Zoloft first and it made me extremely sick.  I switched to Lexapro (generic) after a week and it helped the sickness tremendously. I have been on Lexapro for about a month and a half now and it is really just starting to work.  It is helping a lot with my anxiety but I am having some common and not so common side effects.  The common: difficulty orgasming (this was present in the Zoloft as well for me). Uncommon: I am also having trouble urinating (I can't go right away or at all if I don't REALLY have to go).  My scalp has become very dry and itchy.  I also got a yeast infection, which I am assuming is from the medication.  It is not listed in the side effects but I have seen many other women complain of this.   Over all, the fact that I feel like a normal person again outweighs all of the side effects for me.  I am on 10mg and I plan to go down to 5mg after 6 months and my doctor thinks that will help with the side effects.",7,5
Lexapro,"Pros I felt the positive effects of this medication within a matter of hours.  I was at a point in my life where anxiety was dominating both my personal, professional, and familial relationships. I also had extreme health anxiety, which dominated a lot of my thoughts.  Since starting Lexapro, I have noticed a huge difference in the reduction of my anxiety, including my health anxiety.  I am happier and better able to connect with people (most likely because my anxiety has reduced a lot).  The pros definitely outweigh the cons I experienced. Cons I have heard that this medication can increase suicidal ideation, which is a big con.  I didn't have a huge depressive element to my anxiety, so I can't comment on the effects it has with depression Side effects: I have been having hot flushes, mainly at night Definitely increased thirst and dry mouth Some diarrhoea at the start, but that has settled Some waking up at 5am wide awake",9,10
Lexapro,"Ive been suffering chronic anxiety and regular bouts of deep depression since my mid teens. Im 28. Ive tried everything, including therapy for many years, &amp; was starting to fear I was doomed to feel sad for the rest of my life. I was desperate to see if anything could make me feel better so I set aside my stubborn anti-medication stance. I am so glad I did. Ive been on lexapro 3 wks now (still at a tiny 5mg dose) &amp; saw an almost immediate improvement. My emotions have levelled out &amp; my anxiety has toned down. Side effects were: weird kaleidoscopic closed-eye hallucinations when going to sleep, fluttery chest &amp; increased anxiety in the evening...but only for the first few nights. Still experiencing a bit of sleeplessness. I also found my ability to orgasm disappeared for the first 2.5 weeks (to my horror) and I was considering stopping because of that, but lo and behold, it came back - so if anyone else experiences that I encourage you to hang in there a few weeks!",9,28
Lexapro,"This got rid of my anxiety completely while on it! I finally got my life back. Ive been struggling from severe anxiety my whole life and this finally helped. Like every medication, their are some symptoms that slip through. I still get anxious, but not as often, and only like 5 times a day. For me, thats barely bad. I used to be anxious over EVERYTHING. For my depression it helps me not feel depressed as long, but I still felt almost as equally depressed as before just not everyday. And, most of the time I wasnt depressed. But it did work better for my anxiety. Overall, everyone reacts to different medications differently so my advice probably wont be relevant to your experience.",9,11
Lexapro,"Heres the thing there are so many different types of anxiety and depression medications out there, what works well with one person can have horrible effects on another. Keep that in mind when looking for whats best for you",0,13
Lexapro,"I took Lexapro for a couple of years and stopped but have now just started back up again due to severe anxiety along with some agoraphobia. The first time I was on it, I started at 10 mg and went to 20 mg after two weeks. For me this medication works very well. Startup side effects are slight nausea, jitters, and not sleeping very well. Also more difficult to ejaculate. The jitters which, when you already have anxiety, will only exacerbate the problem until the side effects wear off after about a week or so. It's helpful to have a prescription for Ativan or Xanax on standby to get through any panic attacks during the startup period. When it does kick in, there isn't a wow, I feel amazing! moment. More wow, I don't feel awful anymore.",8,21
Lexapro,"Lexapro is the first SSRI I've tried, and it's done wonders for me. I'm not a slave to my moods anymore - I'm extremely grateful for the emotional stability this drug has given me. It's absolutely fantastic for anxiety. The only side effect I've experienced is decreased libido, which is why I'm giving it a 9 and not a 10.",9,20
Lexapro,"My wife began taking Lexapro about two months ago.  After two weeks her personality was unrecognizable.  One month after she began taking Lexapro she filed for divorce.  She began calling the police on me and of course the police did nothing to me. We had five kids.  My whole world, my kids lives, all of it destroyed by this drug.  Don't do it.",1,15
Lexapro,I was suffering bad anxiety when I lost a very close friend. I started to think something was wrong with me and gradually my anxiety took over. I was at the doctor every other day with palpitations thinking I was having a heart attack then thinking I had lumps around that area. After about 6 weeks I finally said to my doctor I need help he prescribed me lexapro 10mgs the first 5 weeks were horrible couldnt keep awake feeling sick could hardly eat felt awful. Then it kicked in Im back to myself I find it an amazing medication please stick with it. Im so happy I did. But as I said first 5 weeks were tough. But now it has turned me back to myself.,10,26

I decided to look into Lexapro reviews some of them really scared me. I thought why not give it a shot one of my cousins takes Lexapro. The doctor switched me from Prozac to Lexapro and Im going on three weeks I feel so much better I have more energy  Im not sleeping all the time. Im noticing more things that make me happy. I did have side effects in the beginning but they were very mild constipation dizziness tingly feelings but those are starting to go away. Im so glad I try this medication I hope it continues to work for me. The doctor started me on 5 mg and Im slowly working my way up to 10 mg. Write your reviews because people actually do read them.",10,69
Lexapro,"My first few days I had a lot of nausea as expected then some increased anxiety. But after a few week to around 6 weeks in I was back to my old self. Life saver for me! Everyday prior to taking lexapro for months was a struggle with anxiety and random panic attacks, face tingling, unbalanced feeling and just feeling off all around. 4 months of taking 10 mg and what a relief. Back to socialization, eating better, feeling better With no face tingling. Give it a try for about 6 weeks for full effects and side effects will subside. They did for me.",9,33

We sold our house and moved closer to her. The anxiety that came with taking over her care and the care of my down syndrome sister was overwhelming. I thought I was dealing with it but finally caved. My MD put me on Lexapro and made me better. Before the lexapro I was grumpy , not happy at work , I didn't want to be around people AND had bowel issues at inopportune times. Lexapro was a life float for me. Yes it made me a little sleepy the first 2 weeks , I had some transient constipation and libido problems but all that passed. I like the person I am on Lexapro.",10,23
Lexapro,"Wasn't sleeping well and was having career-related anxiety.  I went to my PCP and he put me on Ambien and Lexapro.  I was very concerned about effect Lexapro would have on me, but I went ahead and started it.  First day I was a little tingly but no other immediate physical response.  The next morning I woke up retching/dry heaving.  I spent the whole day having hot and cold spells.  My ears were burning.  My head felt congested but without any sinus issues.  I was severely agitated/restless.  I couldn't sit still.  Felt sick all day.  I took the pill again the second morning (yesterday), but today woke up retching again.  Still very restless with some twitching of arms and legs.  Didn't take the medicine again today.",2,7
Lexapro,"I started Lexapro about 4 weeks ago. It helped  anxiety but depression was still there. I talked with counsellor today and he had just gotten back from a symposium on depression. He said people sometimes underuse their anti-depressants. They feel a little better but till not great. He advised increasing the medication to a level I feel really better. So I am going up to 10 mg. I think 10-15 mg may be right for me. Keep trying, this is a chemical imbalance, runs in families. If you R not satisfied w/results then try increasing your dose after discussing with Dr of course. I am so happy to have found this med, my anxiety is already getting better, I've had no major side effects. I wish you all the best.",8,28
Lexapro,I was not going to take Lexapro after reading all the reviews. I was really skeptical about the side effects. I read one very positive review &amp; it changed my mind. I am so glad I started Lexapro two months ago. I was put on Lexapro for anxiety. I was always in a bad mood &amp; everything set me off. I started with 10mg &amp; saw a slight improvement the first week. It wasn't until the Dr put me on 15mg about a month in that I really saw considerable improvement. Two months later I can honestly say I am am so happy to be on this medication. Everything just seems better. I am happy. I find joy in the things I used to. I look forward to social events. My mood is so much better. I did not gain weight. No sexual side affects. Please give it a try!,10,86

Lexapro,"Lexapro pretty much saved my life at one point. Ive had anxiety/depression all my life but a few years ago I was at a low point. I wasnt getting out of bed and felt like I had no reason to even get up in the morning. One day I decided it was time to live again and I saw a psychiatrist. He prescribed me 10mg of lexapro which I was advised to take half of for the 1st two weeks. As most people have mentioned, the 1st few weeks are for SURE not a good time. If you were already dealing with bad depression, I would advise that you stay close to good people for the 1st couple of weeks. I promise you though, it gets better if you wait it out. MAJOR sexual side effects (as in NO sex drive whatsoever) but if you have bad anxiety, its worth it.",7,20
Lexapro,"I started with 0.5 tablets a day with no improvement (should be a stage to test any side effects resulted) 0.5 tablets more for every diagnosis. Kept a level of 3 tablets for longtime A peak of 4 tablets after 1 year and 2 months due to an sad period of my life I almost got no side effects and my anxiety kept reducing with less washing action for my clothing and less care of tiny dirt (Kind of dirt that I concern) However, my mood is still not always good (except those anxiety from dirt). Not sure what matters But overall Lexapro helps me a lot! At least I have more time to sleep (I used to wash my stuff until 3-4am 3-4 days a week but now I seldom wash, I have my normal bedtime even though I need to wash Sth)",9,8
Lexapro,"For me and other people I have suggested this medication too it has completely changed our lives for the better. Reading reviews you often see knee jerk reactions from people suffering deeply and then taking the medication and going through the up to 4 week period of feeling worse. That is a tough 4 weeks if you felt you where already at breaking point, easy to pull out the pitch fork at that time. But you're less likely to hear from the people who would tell you the polar opposite of that because once taking lexapro providing you are feeling better its easy to leave the dark world behind and return to the light.  My suggestion to anyone who has been recommended this, ignore stigma and try this for at least 4 weeks at your doctors direction. GL ML",9,39

I didn't want to take medication for a very long time, because I just didn't want to be a medicated mom. I always thought it would get better. It didn't and I was exhausted. I am taking only 10mg of lexapro now (therapeutic dose is considered 20mg) and I'm staying at 10. My life is COMPLETELY different. I feel joy and happiness again, my anxiety is gone, I sleep well, my sadness and anger are gone. It is life changing and I can't believe I didn't do it sooner. And I'm actually a better, happier mom now! Give yourself a chance to get better. Mild side effects at first - mild nausea and headache.",10,55
Lexapro,Before Lexapro I was on Adderall witch I abused with drinking and resulted in alcohol poisoning and Atrial Fibulation (irregular heartbeat) after this  incident my anxiety went through the roof and I feared to drink or take another medication again. I had multiple times where I would go to the emergency room thinking I was having a heart attack and each time they told me it was anxiety. Thats when my doctor recommended lexapro. It does take some time for your body to get used to but once it did my anxiety was almost gone! You just need to let your body get used to it and find the right dose for you. I have been on it for almost a year now and I still get a little anxious but havent had any panic attacks.,9,21
Lexapro,"I was on this medication for a number of years, but I've come off it, because it doesn't help my social anxiety and the side-effects are quite debilitating for me. I have both generalised and social anxiety and though the Lexapro did help me feel generally less anxious, it did not help with the social anxiety. It also made me feel constantly very fatigued. Coming off Lexapro was absolutely horrible and I felt physically and mentally awful. Though it certainly is a good fit for mild to moderate anxiety, I felt like I was trapped on the medication because coming off it even for a day made me physically ill.",6,9
Lexapro,"NEVER HAD AN ANXIETY ATTACK AFTER LEXAPRO. I used to have very severe anxiety , and I had to go to hospital multiple times thinking I had heart attacks.  I had hot/cold flashes, chest pains, pounding heart, couldnt breathe, dizziness.... unfortunately I got off of it to take a pill for my Tourettes syndrome a few weeks ago and my anxiety came back and the new pill made me sick , so now my anxiety is back badly and I had to go to hospital multiple times thinking I had heart issues again... just got put back on lexipro a week ago hasnt started working yet I hope it kicks in :( I also took buspar with lexapro before it is a second anxiety pill and u can take them together .",10,13
Lexapro,"I was taking Celexa for 6 years. It didn't work for me like it once did. I'm 44, hormones are changing. Started Lexapro 4 weeks ago. No side effects, happy and feeling very positive, normal. Once in awhile, I feel angry, but yoga takes my anger away quickly.",10,23
Lexapro,Moved cities to try and save money but this hasn't worked out as planned. I been stressed for the last 8 months and one day I just started getting anxiety attack and just depressed as heck. Went go see doctor. Got on 10mg lexapro for first 2 weeks then 20mg after that. Had minor side effects. Trouble urinating. Dry mouth. Minor head ache and the craziest most vivid dreams. And about a 2 week period of bad depression. All has since gone away. Besides the dreams. Very low libido. Don't drink alcohol on this medication is takes away the effects. Took me 3 days to start feeling the meds again. My anxiety is more manageable and i feel more sociable.,7,13
Lexapro,"Oh my goodness! Can I give this drug a negative rating? Took it for one day and felt like a dang maniac! Took it before bed,  and the next morning I woke up and felt so nauseous. I have taken Zoloft and Paxil at other times in life  and I have never felt so sick and manic - absolute worst feeling ever! Took several days for that one dose to leave my system. However, having sex that night I had the most intense orgasm!",1,3
Lexapro,"If I were to just review this drug from an anxiety/fear of social interaction standpoint, I would say that Lexapro is awesome. Lexapro has stopped me from having tremors every time someone talked to me out of the blue, and I do not mind being in the spotlight anymore during classes. For (group) presentations, I still feel physical symptoms and my tremor building up, but not nearly as much as I did without Lexapro. My biggest fear happens to be giving presentations and this is what I am taking it for primarily. I think if I were to do a standalone presentation, I would still have A LOT of difficulty focusing on the topic at hand but not because of anxiety. This drug makes it very hard for me to focus in school. Hope to go down to 5mg from 10",8,21
Lexapro,"The start of their medication was horrible I am not going to sugar coat it for you. I was tired, had yawns, and brain zaps. I felt sick and nausea all the time. It was like the worst hangover all the time. After about 3 weeks I increased my dose from 10mg to 15mg. Again a lot of side effects. I felt terrible. Now 3 years later I am on 30mg and I don't have anxiety anymore. It took about 6 months for my body to adjust and settle down. I promise you it gets better. Stay with it, like everyone else says it works. It gets better. I can live my life now, I can be a parent, I graduated, I had another child. I'll be in this forever if I have to!",0,53
Lexapro,"I took this a few years ago for anxiety, panic, OCD, and mild agoraphobia and claustrophobia. It helped tremendously. I don't recall any side effects besides hands being shaky and a little more forgetful. I had to stop when I was trying to become pregnant and I'm not sure if it was the weaning off this or the switching to Zoloft but that process wasn't too fun. Not awful though. Still prefer over Zoloft!",10,25
Lexapro,"Lexapro (which is called Cipralex here in Canada) was what they put me on when I first became extremely anxious (after trying talk therapy and Ativan when needed). It KO'd my anxiety extremely well (alongside continued therapy). Not only my acute anxiety that was causing panic attacks and made me unable to leave the house was handled, but the social anxiety I've lived with all my life. However, it caused me to gain a significant amount of weight, my emotions were somewhat blunted, and for the first few months I was on it, I would get quite sleepy in the morning. It did stop working for me after about 2.5 years, but as short-term anxiety treatment it served me well.",6,23
Lexapro,"Follow up on review posted over a year ago: I have just successfully quit Lexapro with a very slow 6 month taper. I took 10-15 mg for panic for one year, then started taper. Wanted to advise to taper ON this med as well as off! My Dr. had me jump right on at 10 mg and the first 3 weeks of adjustment was horrible...by contrast my taper off was a breeze because it was very gradual. Lexapro worked for me and I would take it again if ever necessary!",10,39
Lexapro,"This drug -super small dose - has changed my life.  I have been a nurse for 26 years. My stress and anxiety levels were at the max!  I just wanted to sleep on my days off and I did not want to socialize.  I was easily overwhelmed and worried constantly.  I was just awful.   I started lexapro at 10 mg and it was too much !  I backed down to 5 mg and the first 3 weeks were hell.  I felt out of body - exhausted but could not sleep - it was just an awful three weeks.  After reading many reviews to hang in there --- that's what I did.  Around week 3-4 - I adjusted.  I felt like my worries rolled off my back, I wanted to do things, I felt more energy than I had in years, I was laughing and finally listening to people did not annoy me!  Hang in!!",9,111
Lexapro,"Anxiety lifer here. My demon has gotten cruel in the past few years by manifesting itself in severe premature ventricular contraction (PVC's) every time I start to leave the house or get in a slightly stressful situation.  After a massive panic attack on a flight home from London to DC, I decided I had enough. I told my GP I want to go back on Lexapro. Like every other time, Lexapro works almost immediately for me - my PVC's and agoraphobia have muted drastically on only 5mg a day! Yes there is slight weight gain and potential sexual side effects but I'll take those over the other stuff any day. It's cliche but I do feel like I have my life back. I even ventured out for a run around the city tonight with zero PVC's. Sucks being on a drug but I'm ok with it today.",9,49
Lexapro,"I am on month 2 of starting Lexapro.  I was on Celexa for 4 years top dose and the benefits were declining for me so my physician prescribed 20 MG of Lexapro to start with.  Initially I had no side effects the first month.  Now am finding that I have been having night sweats, strange vivid dreams and all of a sudden bad acne on my face and neck that I never really had before other than the occasional PMS breakout.   My energy level has been wonderful as I was really starting to feel exhausted all the time for no reason while on Celexa and my attention span had dramatically increased since starting Lexapro as I used to have trouble keeping attention.",0,14
Lexapro,"I was having horrible anxiety attacks, panic attacks and was border line manic. I was going through a lot of stress and hit my limit. My family urged me to see a Dr who started me on 2.5 lexapro for a week then up to 5 mg the week after. I stayed on 5 mg for 1 month seeing improvements. Eventually I decided to bump up to 7.5 which I'm currently on . I still get anxiety but I am able to feel in control.  I don't have attacks anymore. I'm sleeping better and eating again. Side effects only lasted the first month . I got really tired 20 min after taking it , drowsy, night sweats. Make sure to take it with a snack, I find it hits the stomach like a rock. Over all has given me my life back. And I don't feel like I'm on medication.",10,40
Lexapro,"My anxiety peaked 6 years ago.  Not only did I dread social interaction of any kind (talking to co-workers, going out with friends, even being around my own family) but I had experienced a panic attack on the freeway which kept me from driving anywhere far from my home for two years.  I was extremely stubborn and didn't want chemicals to change my reality.  I finally had to admit to myself that my reality sucked - bad. I'm overjoyed to report that Lexapro saved me.  It took a month for me to realize I was greeting people in passing again.  I drive on the freeway again and love being around people.  Stick with it even if you feel weird at first.  You CAN have your life back!  I take it at night, the initial drowsiness helps me sleep.",10,70
Lexapro,"I've been on Lexapro for maybe 1.5 years, and this drug has worked pretty well in reducing my anxiety and depression. I started on 10mg which may have helped a tiny bit, but I still felt awful. A month or two after having my dose increased to 20mg, I started to feel better. Lexapro helped me lift myself out of my ~6 month long period of anxiety and depression, but I wasn't cured. I still have mental issues which I need to work on.  In terms of side effects, there were almost none. I got headaches right when I started and also after going on 20mg, but they only lasted a few days. I also find my long-term memory is a bit worse, and time seems to fly by faster. Oh, and it's super cheap if you can get the generic version.",7,14
Lexapro,extreme increased anxiety,1,8
Lexapro,"excellent med if you are afraid of side effects, had none. used for 10 yrs until stopped working. was on celexa also for 10 yrs excellent med for no side effects .both Lexapro and Celexa are excellent for treating mental disease. avoid ZOLOFT was on for two weeks my brain was in another dimension , made anxiety worse. now its hell on earth for me looking for another ssri. clonzepam is excellent for anxiety no side effects. docs wont prescribe it for me.",10,19
Lexapro,"A year ago I had a major health scare that turned out to be fine in the end, but I ended up crashing, developing severe insomnia, severe anxiety, muscle twitches all over, major joint pain, brain fog and finally a depression. I resisted taking drugs as I thought I was going to get lots of side effects. I tried everything under the sun; yoga, meditation, acupuncture, tinctures, craniosacral therapy, psychotherapy, kinesiology etc. My psychiatrist and GP both strongly recommended I should take Lexapro. When I started pondering why I was living I started taking the meds. I started sleeping better and after some weeks the worst dread was gone and so was the anxiety. After 2 months I feel MUCH better and I hardly had any side effects at all!:)",10,49
Lexapro,"I started taking lexapro my first semester of sophomore year in college for depression and  anxiety and have been taking it for about six months now. My anxiety causes me to have extreme panic attacks where I break out in rashes and get frequent bloody noses. Since being on lexapro, I have not had a single attack!  I also haven't had any extreme side effects although I have had increased appetite and have gone from 95-100lbs to about 115lbs.  However, the withdrawal symptoms are very serious, take it everyday and try not to skip any days. I got a nasty cold and stopped taking it for awhile and then spent a whole week thinking I had a horrible flu (nausea, vomiting, headaches) only to realize I was going through withdrawals.",9,23
Lexapro,"I had to start at 5 mg and work my way up because I'm a baby, but I definitely feel better and oddly enough, my headaches have improved after 20 years. I don't feel any different, I'm just worrying less and not feeling the physical symptoms of anxiety. It still comes and goes a small bit, but it's WAY better!",10,45
Lexapro,"I had tried everything meditation, herbal supplements, yoga, exercise, healthy eating. I was doing everything right however I was in a constant state of unrest and having about 5 panic attacks a day. I would go days without eating or drinking water and then collapsing. My anxiety was so high, was sick all the time gut issues, headaches, dizziness, general fog and feeling completely out of it and detached. It came to the point that something needed to change - so I sucked it up and tried Lexapro. If you are reading this YOU CAN FEEL BETTER. I was scared I would feel like a zombie and loose myself - but it just takes the edge off and you will start to feel lighter and free and it will let therapy and meditation work.",10,101
Lexapro,"Difficult personal situations caused my Ativan usage to creep up to 3-4x/day. When I started being perimenopause, I was also suffering with terrible depression, which I have never had before. My GYN prescribed Lexapro, and I've always been against taking an SSRI because of the side effects and feeling like I could just work through the anxiety, but the depression was debilitating. I forced myself to take the first pill, and the next day, I realized I wasn't under a cloud of stress anymore. It worked well for about 3 weeks, and then I was irritable and the anxiety was back. I just started on 20mg and feel optimistic. Only minor side effects: headache, some nausea the first few days, insomnia. I've lost weight, which is a plus!",9,26
Lexapro,This medication is possibly good for thousands of patients but gave me agitation and hot feet after  using only for only  3 days . These symptoms might happened to others as any medicine probably cause reaction to any individual.,1,7
Lexapro,Lexapro was a miracle drug for me as far as treating my severe health anxiety and PTSD.  It gave me my life back. I can truly say I was my normal self 98% of the time. However it caused me to have extreme muscle tension and headaches. I was even diagnosed with TMJ and was sleeping with a mouthguard at night. Weaning off Lexapro was horrific for me. It took a good 3 months for all the withdrawal symptoms to subside. Thankfully the headaches and stiff jaw got better as well. I'm sad I can't take Lexapro anymore. It saved my life. I'm about to start on Prozac. We'll see what happens.,8,26
Lexapro,"I'm someone that has been generally anxious for my whole life with spells of depression sprinkled in. Recently I thought I had been improving with my anxiety but then I had a panic attack, out of the blue, with no rhyme or reason; it just happened. I was afraid this would affect my work so I finally pushed myself to see a psychiatrist, who suggested that Lexapro would be an appropriate option. I started taking it and had some nasty side affects (no appetite, nausea, slight dizziness, jitters, tenseness) for the first two days but after that I noticed how well it was working. My anxiety has lessened immensely and it's giving me a second chance I never knew I wanted. I'm still in the first week of trying it but it's worked excellently so far!",9,49
Lexapro,"I started having frequent panic attacks and anxiety spikes and my doctor suggested Lexapro. I had really bad nausea and lack of appetite the first week and had to force myself to eat to ease the hunger pains. After that subsided, I had a lot of muscle tension and soreness. It felt like my whole body was vibrating as if being electrically shocked. I was fidgeting all day, sitting in unusual postures, mistyping far more than usual, and knocking things over on my desk. After four weeks the panic attacks had stopped and my anxiety had improved slightly, but the muscular side-effects had me even more worried. I called my doctor and he switched me back to Sertraline. Tapering off Lexapro made the vibration and tension go away almost immediately.",5,25
Lexapro,"I began taking 5 mg of lexapro 10 days ago, for postpartum depression/anxiety. It has been a lifesaver. The initial side effects faded within a week. I take it in the morning, because I knew that it would possibly make me jittery at first. I had tiredness in the afternoon and evening and a loss of appetite for the first 5 days, but those have faded completely. I searched and searched for positive reviews on this drug for postpartum depression/anxiety and could not find any. If anyone is on the fence about taking medication for postpartum depression, please consider it for a temporary aid in getting you past it.",10,60
Lexapro,"I was prescribed Lexapro after some fairly rough depression and anxiety. I had been in the hospital 3 times in 2 weeks for anxiety attacks. The first day after Lexapro, I felt the depression gone. Literally the first day. However, the first 3-4 weeks were rough. I definitely had nausea and was VERY sleepy. But after about a month, the nausea and sleepiness went away. A nurse at our doctor's office basically told me to suck it up, and that I had to give the medicine time to work. I toughed it out, and after about 6 weeks, it was like a cloud was lifted and I have felt AMAZING ever since. I didn't realize that I have probably had depression and/or anxiety for decades until I found out what it was like to feel great. Still great after a year.",10,137
Lexapro,I was prescribed lexapro about a year after my assault. I took only one pill. It made me feel worse than the anxiety it self. I was in a daze all day not sure how I made to college that day and back home. Walking was like I was drunk and the overall feeling inside me was horrible. what a waste of $65.00 back then.,1,17
Lexapro,"I suffer from depression and anxiety. I was on a number of meds before my doctor put me on Lexapro.. they were all horrible and made my anxiety worse. I was starting to lose hope that I would never find a medication to help. Thankfully Lexapro is helping! It's a lifesaver!! I could tell a difference after the first day..I'm much more normal I don't fly into a rage so easily, I don't feel overwhelmed constantly and I'm not irritated all the time for no reason. My moods are much more stable. Before Lexapro I seriously felt like I was losing it. My husband even told me he notices a huge difference in me since being on this. I'm also prescribed klonopin for my anxiety but since being on Lexapro I haven't had a need to take it. I love Lexapro!",10,98
Lexapro,"I have suffered from Anxiety and Panic attacks since my 20's sporadically. Now in my 40's recurrence has significantly increased due to a series of personal events to a point that I was starting to be afraid of being alone.  I was hesitant to initiate medication but 3 weeks into it I feel the best I have felt in a long time. The first two weeks are tough, with nausea, dizzyness and headaches but it is worth it.",9,60
Lexapro,"I take 10mg daily beginning two years ago for anxiety. The only side affect was for the first week. All I wanted to do was sleep. My body relaxed so much, I was not sleep deprived anymore. Afterwards it levelled off. My Dr. and I keep constant checkups and it's working out great.",9,53
Lexapro,"Lexapro was a life saver for me. It helped me complete every day tasks that I could not do before taking this drug. I've tried nearly every other SSRI but this one was the best. The only negative part about this drug is the withdrawal symptoms. They are HORRIBLE. I recently found out I was pregnant and I had to cut down my dose according to my Dr. I was super dizzy, very faint and unable to leave my house. If I didn't have to stop these drugs, I would still be okay. However, slowly weening off these drugs have caused me to slip in a horrible anxious state.",6,31
Lexapro,"I developed severe panic attacks. I felt like I was dying or going to pass out. Something was seriously wrong with me.  Logically I knew nothing was going to happen but then the panic came anyone I left the house. Shaking, sweating, disorentation, couldn't breathe etc etc. Starting lexapro was hard. I started at small dose of 5mg and had to adjust to it. Nothing more than I already felt. After about 2 weeks I started to not notice I was taking anything.  And then all the sudden I was at a store and I forgot to panic,  I felt fine.  I do have panic attacks still they are not gone but better.  There are situations I still can't handle but daily living,  going to work, school function,  dinner etc I can now do.",8,56
Lexapro,"Before lexapro I spent the majority of my time sleeping in bed and hiding away from people, plus I felt really depressed.  It's really good for anxiety.  I rarely worry anymore.   I only focus on solutions and try not to worry about the things I can't control, and lexapro has helped me feel more emotionally balanced.",9,71
Lexapro,"I have been taking lexapro for about six months now.  I was put on it for a panic attack and mild depression.  I am someone who never takes meds unless I have too and was very worried about being on this drug because I feared the side affects when it would be time to get off. I decided on therapy and lexapro.  I am only on ten milagrams, 39 and petite.  I can't say that this drug has caused me weight gain but if I am extra hungry I choose a healthier snack.  I will say that the first few days of taking the med I did feel tired,  and tense in my arms but I will say the panic attack attributed to that.  I am doing great I am more relaxed and happier .  Therapy is key too.  Hang in there and talk to someone!!",8,54
Lexapro,"I was once you, anxiously reading reviews for Lexapro. I began getting severe anxiety and mild depression and my doctor recommended 10mg of Lexapro. I have never liked taking drugs, but I felt like it was my only choice. The first 2-3 weeks my experience worsened. Every side effect you could have, I had. Drowsiness, sleep problems, nausea, vomiting, decreased libido, constant yawning, the list goes on. However it started to lighten up every week. By Week 6, every side effect was gone. 11 months later and I'm still on 10mg and I can't explain how much my life has improved over the past year. My life is back. I'm happier than ever and enjoying every aspect of life again. It may be hard at the start, but it's worth it. I believe in you! peace",10,212
Lexapro,Didn't notice an effect yet...,0,10
Lexapro,"Supposed to be 6 weeks to take effect. I felt instantly calmer, happen the NEXT day! Couldn't believe it. Started at 10mg moved to 20 MG in year of use. My problem now is  its been 7 years of working for me but 20mg doesn't have same effect of earlier years. I want to have  increase in MG use. How to I get doctor to do this?",10,13
Lexapro,"I hated lexapro I tried it twice with 20mg and had to stop taking it, Every time I took it I threw up a lot, I felt horrible I felt like a zombie, I also had mild hallucinations that were not fun and rapid heartbeat it was just awful.",1,16
Lexapro,"Wow, just wow. It's been almost going on 2 months, and I feel like a completely better person. First of all hang in there. Side effects are hard the first week but you will get levelled out. I go to the gym and don't have an anxiety attack and run out after only 30 minutes thinking I'm dying. The fear factor has went away and that's the first thing I have noticed. My overall mental balance and mood has dramatically improved, I don't feel as off in a chemical imbalanced but more balanced and confident. I don't ever want to get off this.",9,35
Lexapro,My son was a heroin addict which upon learning about it sent me to a very high anxiety level. If he wouldn't answer the phone by the time I drove home in my mind I thought for sure he was dead. This medicine made me normal again no thoughts like before no crying episodes and just calm. I'm on 10 mg been on it 2 years. Just feeling great,10,64
Lexapro,"I've had anxiety and severe panic attacks for a year now. 10 mg helped but still had attacks on the weekend. I just started 20 mg so hopefully that will stop them completely! The two weeks of side effects (headache, insomnia) are worth the end result!",10,28
Lexapro,"I'm on the 3rd month of taking lexapro , started off with 2.5mg every night for about a week, then upped to 5mg and when I saw my doctor again 2 weeks later he told me to try the 10mg and I have been on 10mg ever since. At first it's none stop drowsiness weird random dreams and anxiety and insomnia at night. For a good 4-5 weeks , but after that it's cravings and you eat more and calmly and it gets better! It has work wonders! Hopefully it continues to work!",9,47
Lexapro,Experienced hair loss and horrible scalp issues.  Also headaches and weight gain.   This drug is horrible and should not be allowed on the market.,1,23
Lexapro,"I have severe  constant pain all over from rheumatoid arthritis which has me so crippled in my back, hands, fingers, shoulders, hips, ankles and knees. I am unable to walk and use a walker.  I also have fibromyalgia which causes much pain and mental confusion  sometimes.  My Rheumatologist started me on 10 mg of Lexipro at first two years ago . I felt a bit drowsy for a couple of weeks until my body got used to the medicine.   About four months ago had a hip replacement  and a nightmare arthritis flare up.  The flare up has not subsided yet , so my doctor increased the Lexapro to 20mg each morning and 20 mg each night.  I take it about 8 pm  a little before bed time.  I haven't noticed any additional side effects .  This drug helps me.",9,27
Lexapro,"Wonder drug for me. I have been on and off 10 mg Lexapro for 5 years. Went through withdrawals while weaning myself off through the beginning of 2 pregnancies. Withdrawals feel like you are coming down with something and the world is a scary unknown new place. Brain zaps are weird too. But I went back on the medication after giving birth because I truly am the text book person with generalized anxiety disorder. It consumes every part of my life. I was just upped to 15 mg a week ago because the 10 was just not quite doing it for me anymore. Life has thrown some serious medical conditions our way. My son was diagnosed with cancer, as was my father, and my other son has down syndrome so my anxiety really spiked. The 15 mg has been wonderful.",10,81
Lexapro,This medicine was an extremely horrible experience for me. My doctor prescribed it to me for anxiety and day one sent me off the edge. How I felt during anxiety attacks was how this medication made me feel but fifty times worse. I felt like I drank a million milligrams of coffee and was on pins and needles for 8 hours. After reading these reviews I hate that it didn't have the same affect on me as it did the majority. I hate anxiety but I can't see myself taking another one of those pills EVER.,1,28
Lexapro,"I was taking Xanax..0.25 mgs three times everyday for over 13 years. My Dr wanted me to wean off of it so to help thru the process she had me take 5mgs per day of Lexapro (escitolopram).  I kept taking the Lexapro for 1-1/2 years. During this time my Dr raised the dosage to 10 mgs daily. Lexapro wasn't the medicine for me. It caused more anxiety, mood swings and weight gain along with not feeling like myself. With the help of my Dr I weaned off Lexapro over a period of 3 weeks. After the 2nd day of not taking Lexapro I started with constant brain zaps, fatigue, dizziness with vertigo and felt overall awful. This continued for the next 7 weeks but the withdrawal symptoms lessened each week. I am now at the 8th week and feel wonderful!",1,20
Lexapro,"Have been on and off lexapro for the last 20 years (more on than off). This time I was off the medication from for about 5 months and the anxiety and depression was back even though I had a change of life style, doing plenty of exercise and changing work environments.  For me the side effects were feeling nauseous, insomnia (normally 1 nights average sleep and the next no sleep, constant swallowing which I think is called dry mouth and just feeling miserable for the first 3 weeks.  I'm into my fourth week now and sleeping a lot better and feeling much better in myself.   If you are having the same side effects, hang in there as life will get a lot better",8,36
Lexapro,"I was given lexapro 10 mg once per day I have been on it since July as my anxiety was pretty bad I was also given Xanax ( which did noting ) so they gave me Valium ( still had no effect) so j have been just taking lexapro now and it seems to be ok , I still get nervous feeling sometimes but not as bad as they were . In the first two weeks of taking lexapro I felt very sick I got sick a few times and just felt rotten but the Dr did tell that would happen and after about 2 weeks I felt perfect again ,",8,27
Lexapro,"So far I'm happy with the Lexapro I had the yawning, drowsy in the afternoons one night consisted of the jitters but half a 5mg valium had me soon settled, and so far only needed it the once. I still don't have much of an appetite at the moment so that's the worst of it all so far fingers crossed it stays that way. I have noticed my anxiety getting better slowly it's only been 1 week on 5mg I don't want to get my hopes up but I guess that's my anxiety way of thinking kicking in.",8,21
Lexapro,I have a fear of driving and social anxiety when it comes to standing in line etc. did Zoloft for 2 weeks and thought my life was over. Went and changed my meds to lexapro half a pill every night before bed.i feel like me again. Not a different happy weirdo but the old me. I am now on 10mg and it's only been a month but I'm so glad how it's working. A little sweaty but that's about it . I also take blood pressure meds for my anxiety as needed. Before anyone tries xanaex or lorazepam I highly recommend this medicine. No side effects and non habit forming,9,51
Lexapro,"I have pretty bad anxiety, with some depression. Sometimes I get so overwhelmed that I feel like my life is falling apart, and it feels so real. When I take my lexapro, I feel so much better. It's just a baseline, it doesn't MAKE me happy, it just allows me to feel like a normal human. I'm most myself when I take my medicine because I can focus on things outside of my own stress and fears. It can make you a little nauseous at first, and I experience some insomnia the first few weeks, but it goes away. SO worth it.",10,70
Lexapro,"The reason for my review is in hope that I can convince someone out there who needs help with their anxiety to try this medication. It seriously has been changing my life. It's only been 2 months and I'm already feeling normal. It took a little less than a month for me to really start feeling happier and less anxious. I used to be very negative because of my anxiety. I never wanted to socialize or do anything. I started a new job, which used to be one of my biggest anxiety triggers. But it has been going so well! I'm social and can talk to my coworkers and customers with confidence and my negative thoughts aren't really there anymore. I'll admit the side effects the first few weeks were horrible! Just stick it out, I promise it's worth it.",9,99
Lexapro,"I have been self medicating for years with tramadol. I suffer from anxiety, panic attacks, and depression. I was taking way to much tramadol to cope with life and was spending money I didn't have to buy it! It's a miracle that this drug works so great! I was at the point where all I did was sleep and dodge all things social! I'm only on day 3 and I already feel the pre depression me returning! Oh, I also take vistaril when the panic and anxiery really hits! I've only taken my 10 mg Lexapro and one 25 mg Vistiral this morning and I feel great! It doesn't give me the euphoric feeling that tram does but this is so much better! I almost feel normal! If I feel this great already I can only imagine how much better it'll get!",10,27
Lexapro,"23/F I was diagnosed with GAD a few months ago and started on generic lexapro, first 5mg/day then up to 10mg/day. It took a few weeks to take effect, but it was incredible at counteracting the anxiety. My self-confidence increased and panic attacks went away completely. The reason I give it a 6/10 and the reason I came off it, however, is because of the sexual side effects. It took away my ability to orgasm, which was extremely frustrating for me. I'm working with my doctor to find a different med to treat my anxiety without the sexual side effects of SSRIs.",6,24
Lexapro,I've been taking 10mg lexapro for anxiety for 5 days now. Off and on in the past yr my level of anxiety has escalated so much that I thought I might have a nervous breakdown or something. I became anti social and angry. I would break down in tears if I thought about anything for more than 3 seconds. I felt hopeless and helpless. I also take Adderall xr20MG. My dr gave me lexapro 10mg  and said I might experience the side effects and call her in 1 wk if it was too much too handle. Headache for a couple hrs was all I experienced. I feel awesome! Like a wet blanket has been lifted off of me. I don't avoid people anymore and I feel like I can face the world and be me again. I think now that the tension is lifted I feel better physically!,9,34
Lexapro,"I started lexapro after 3 years of severe anxiety and panic attacks pretty much daily. I was so terrified to take anything fearing it would make it worse or make me crazy. But my anxiety pushed me to major depression from my irrational fears. I kept thinking it's gonna get so bad I'm gonna end up losing my job and becoming homeless. Reviews from others scared me also. Finally I told myself it couldn't get any worse than this. Well it's been 2 weeks and I haven't felt that horrible dread feeling. I'm way less anxious. It's pretty much saved me. There are side effects.  Tolerable though. Nausea and headaches the first few days. It also causes bad urinary retention and sweating. But to me,they're worth not feeling the way I did.",9,48
Lexapro,"Lexapro has helped me so much. I am currently on week 6 of a 10mg dose. 24yr old male.  I felt the effects almost immediately. The first 3 days it gave me extreme ADD. I could not focus on one thing for more than 1 minute. My brain was jumping from thought to thought like never before. After the first week I suddenly had a moment of clarity and was able to focus better than I ever was before. My anxiety and depression in the morning completely went away. I was able to get out of bed. No more driving anxiety or thoughts of self harm. All completely went away. The only negative thing that I have found is one side effect. It now takes a very, very long time for me to reach orgasm during sex. Sometimes not at all. No matter how pretty she is.",10,42
Lexapro,"I have anxiety and depression. Lexapro is the first anxiety medication I have taken since I've only been diagnosed a week ago. I can tell you that by a long shot this medication has helped me. I have major anxiety driving and the first day I was on it, my anxiety driving was 95% gone. I take 10 mg of lexapro and take 50 mg of Tranzadone to sleep at night. Both are very helpful in conjunction. Plus lexapro doesn't make me feel like a zombie !! Win win.",10,43
Lexapro,I had immediate results.I definitely felt less edgy just 3 days into my 10mg nightly dose. I had a headache first two days but took pain relief and it knocked it out. So far it has already provided relief from my constant anxiety and edginess.,10,35
Lexapro,"Having been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder over ten years ago and taking Xanax 1 mg. twice a day, I was surprised when my doctor prescribed Lexapro, not instead of, but in addition to.  He said it was a mood stabilizer, but I know its and SSRI generally used as an anti-depressant.  Medical guidelines now require, or at least I've been told as much by my doctor, that primary physicians are required to ask questions regarding mental health.  I was asked, Have you in the past two weeks lost interest in your normal activities?  No.  Have you in the past two weeks had thoughts of suicide?  No.  Still, he prescribed the Lexapro and I started taking it.  The side effects were horrible.  Every symptom of depression, which I didn't have",1,20
Lexapro,"I am on day 6 of taking Lexapro and I must say that I am very pleased with the results so far. My husband is deploying and I began experiencing panic attacks and anixiety back in May. I thought it was just me and I could brush it off or get over it. As time went on, I noticed that my symptoms became worse. I was crying everyday, worrying, panic attacks, aniexty attacks and having intrusive thoughts, which began to make me extremely depressed. I had no energy, insomnia, crying, mentally exhausted and no appetite. I finally broke down and went to my GP and told him what was going on. He recommended several different anti-depressants. I had been reading about the different anti-depressants and found that Lexapro got the best reviews. I was reluctant to begin taking meds but thought I had no choice. I know it might be premature but I feel 100% better that I did a week ago. The only side effect that I experienced was a insomnia for the first 3 nights, loss of appetite and no libido. I didn't have much of a libido to begin with, so it doesn't bother me. I didn't experience nausea like I read on other reviews. I am slowly getting my appetite back and sleep so good at night. It makes a little groggy first thing in the morning but once I get up and get going, I'm good. I take 10 mg every morning. My doctor wants me to increase my dosage to 20 mg after 2 weeks but I will wait and see how I feel. I highly recommend this medication. It has really helped me. I feel so much better!!!",10,61
Lexapro,"I was having terrible mood problems and depression. The doctor prescribed me Lexapro...and I guess I never realized I even suffered from anxiety until now.  The results were beyond amazing---mood has been lifted noticeably...but the kicker...and VERY unexpectedly-my cervical pain was reduced by about 97% -and tension I dealt with nearly daily (I thought from the imperfection of my cervical vertebrae-because I had a 2-level fusion about 11 years ago and they've spotted a slight bulging recently in the C4 vertebrae, which is right above the fused level) and I could finally-FINALLY-get off of pain medication, after relying on it for a decade to make my days bearable! Many yrs of pain mgmt.-and an unexpected med takes care of nearly 100% of it!",10,49
Lexapro,I thought Lexapro wasn't going to help my anxiety but after about 3 weeks it made a huge difference. I feel like I'm living again!,10,66
Lexapro,"I am 23 and have had extreme anxiety/panic since around 20.  I am super sensitive to meds/ side effects.  I have tried so many AD and none have worked.  Recently I have tried Remeron but had to switch due to drowsiness- I have hypersomnia.  Lexapro by far has taken away my worrying mind more than anything which is amazing.  The first month was pretty horrid besides that though.  Constant nausea, yawning, worsened anxiety at first, headaches.  I still have some nausea and now I have noticed extreme drowsiness again. I really love how it helps my anxiety, but (like always) the side effects really bother me.  Try it out, get thru the 1st month. If you don't have bad side effects its the best anxiety med I have ever had.  Good luck!",8,45
Lexapro,"I started getting anxiety my first year of college. I had previously had mild anxiety, but it was not as debilitating. I was constantly worrying what others thought about me and had obsessive thoughts. I started on 10mg of lexapro and it completely changed my outlook on life. I did not realize how fun life could be before I lived it without the looming cloud of anxiety. It also helped tremendously with anxiety surrounding the intrusive thoughts. Some things that WORSENED my anxiety while on lexapro were birth control pills (hormone imbalance worsens anxiety) and hard alcohol. I take 1/2 tsp inositol powder (a type of vitamin) and probiotics that seem to help my anxiety and depression in addition to the lexapro.",10,39
Lexapro,"Only took 2.0 mg first time &amp; 2.0 mg in evening.  So 4mg altogether daily.  Instant relief upon first dose.  Immediate. Gave me headache first dose for about 3 hours but after that all good for 3 days.  On 4th day got another headache in evening for few hours.  Last night took it at about 10pm, got to sleep but woke up at 4am couldn't get bk to sleep til 7am.  Gives u vivid dreams that feel real.  I wouldn't recommend starting with any more than 2.5mg or 4mg max split in two doses at least 8-10-12 hrs apart. 2.0mg each dose max. I'm thinking of making my evening dose just 1mg or bc it's much stronger and more of an upper than celexa. Does makes u feel tired but the anxiety is gone, less hypersensitive but can be too 'high' agitating.",6,13
Lexapro,"I'm in my early 30's and never had a problem with depression or anxiety until I lost my mother to cancer 18 months ago.  I fell into a depression after that and my doctor prescribed me generic lexapro for short term depression ( as it has never been an issue).  I noticed within 2 weeks that I felt better...I had more energy, etc.. Not liking the idea of being on meds, I weaned off it after 6 months.. I still had withdrawal symptoms (electric shock feeling).  Well after that my husband left me and that combined with the loss of my mother was too much to bear. I was miserable. I only left the house to go to work and it was difficult to pull myself out of bed.  As soon as I got home I would throw on pj's and just lay on the couch. PAGE 1 of 2",9,24
Lexapro,"I have had exaustion, stress and anxiety for a few months now and recently the anxiety got worse and for the first time in my life I had a panic attack twice in one day. I went to hospital and the doc prescribed the meds but I was afraid to start taking them. I also saw a therapist who also thought I could get past this without meds. After I had a bad panick attack at night I decided to start taking them..Its been 3 days and I have hardly slept and have nausea especially in the evenings and at night..Im feeling less anxious but I really need to sleep because I have to go back to work tomorrow. Please tell me this gets better because my doc said she is only putting me on these for 2 weeks then we will review and see if I can go off them",5,12
Lexapro,"I have had panic attacks for years after trying many other a it depressants that made this worse Lexapro was my magic pill I have had a 90% reduction in acute panic disorder and general anxiety, with this drug I'm normal person again and I have my life back.  I'm my opinion this is a blockbuster drug and I'm so thankful to the chemist that created it.  Thank you for giving me my life back!  &lt;3",9,83
Lexapro,"I had been experiencing milder depressive symptoms for a couple of months, but then suddenly one morning I woke up with all the physical symptoms of a panic attack, which I'd never had before (never had any anxiety symptoms before), and symptoms persisted almost nonstop for 4 days until I could get in with my doctor. I wasn't having anxiety about any one specific thing, I just felt hopeless and like I'd lost control of my thinking. She prescribed me klonopin for immediate relief (big help) and the generic version of lexapro (10 mg) to actually address the problem in tandem with counseling. I'm only a week in but feeling LIKE MYSELF and so much better in general. Had some headaches and sleepiness/yawning in the first week but lessening now",10,64
Lexapro,"Lexapro has changed my life....I am an alcoholic who could never be in social situation without drinking...when I became sober I isolated myself from crowds, friends, working etc until I found lexapro which has cured me of my anxietities and I can now have a normal life without drinking.  I'm the me I was before I started drinking and couldn't be happier.  I also hear people say they've gained weight I have actually lost five pounds doing my normal activities and eating healthy",10,80
Lexapro,"I've been taking lexapro for about a year now and it seems to help a lot with my social anxiety. I don't think about nor care what people think as much as I used to. But it does make me kinda have like no emotion toward people's feeling &amp; what not. Which is a downside. But I used to be afraid of big crowds. I wouldn't really want to be around people but at the same time I did because I wanted to have friends and be outgoing but it was extremely hard for me. Also I had like mild depression, always negative thoughts. But since I've been taking it it's definitely made me more positive and more friendly. Before I would always worry about everything and when I say everything I mean everything lol. With out it I do have bad withdrawal &amp; it sucks.",8,43
Lexapro,"I have only been taking Lexapro a few days, but I can tell a bit of improvement, but as of now I still get paranoid or to say anxious which makes me exhausted. And I'm not  much on going around people a lot, just one on one conversations with a friend or relative. Hoping and praying it works like a lot of post here which are positive. Hoping to gain weight, for I'm at 113pds....when I was 130, Yea lost quite a bit of weight...the lexapro im hoping will give me a better appetite which I've read it does.  This is an update on day 6, I slept full 8 hours and that was with getting off to sleep with help of xanax. But really feel better and have some energy and some of the worry is gone...and hoping to get better. Going to keep taking it.",7,30
Lexapro,"My psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro to treat general anxiety, which it barely impacted, and since starting it 4 weeks ago I've become severely depressed and spend all day contemplating suicide. I don't know if it's entirely the medicine's fault, or if it even had anything to do with it, but it certainly hasn't helped me with anything, and I can't find anything online about it actually worsening depression instead of treating it.",1,27
Lexapro,"Lexpro is the best medication. I had no life befor Lexpro. I used to suffer for 8 years from anxiety and panick attacks. I was always scared from anything. The doctor asked me to try Lexpro I was so afriad of medications, I thought medications would never help me. I used think that I will help my self to stop thinking about it. I thought they were all thoughts in my mind and I have to change them I used to get panick attacks everday when I'm sleeping. I would recommend anyone to try this medication because this medication will safe your life if you have anxity I have been 10 mg for months then 15 for 2 months and 4 months for 20 Mg and am still taking it. And I will never stop taking it",10,65
Lexapro,"I have extreme anxiety and major depression. For me, all SSRI's, SSNRI's make me feel extremely weird. Almost as if my body feels too good but not in a good way. The only way to describe it is like jolts of electric shocks throughout my body that feel good. Also when I yawn or take a deep breath my teeth start to chatter. It also creates extreme erectile dysfunction for me to the point where it burns when I urinate. Unfortunately these are symptoms I cannot put up with, even though it does work.",2,16
Lexapro,"After months of cbt with my psychologist for severe anxiety and panic disorder i decided to seek help from a psychiatrist.  I was perscribed 5mg then 10mg of lexapro to start and it gradually incresed to 20mg.  In the first few days i had never felt worse. More frequant and severe panic attacks and my general anxiety went through the roof and i had the most extreme feeling of hopelessness. I was a mess and calling my drs telling them i needed to stop taking it. They reassured me these side affects would go away within weeks, and they did. I continued with the cbt, mindfullness, lifestyle changes and stayed on the lexapro and within months i felt i was back to my normal self. Post like these kept me going. Hang in there, you're not alone!",8,139
Lexapro,"Started Lexapro 2006 for acute anxiety &amp; depression. Within days I felt a shroud of darkness lift. After 12 months I felt it was changing me into a person with less emotions, so I went off it. Within a few weeks I felt a sharpness and sensitivity that had been missing but, any negative occurrences gave me intense anxiety. In late 2008 the GFC hit me hard. I was paralyzed with fear and had thoughts of suicide. In desperation I went back on lexapro and again, all the anxiety and fear went away. After a couple of years I went off it again and felt reasonably OK. Issues in 2013 caused me to attempt suicide. I survived and went back on Lexapro. I may have less emotions, but I can now deal with life. Strangely, It also fixed my AF heart condition",8,38

Lexapro,"I've been on lexapro for five days now and I've never felt more anxious in my life, I haven't been eating and when I do eat nothing stays in my stomach long, my sleeping has been a nightmare, maybe 5 hours a night if I'm lucky, and I'm shaky all through the night and partially through the day, I feel like I'm going crazy but I keep reading reviews that side effects are awful then subside and the medication is great, I'm just really feeling like I'm losing it here",4,38
Lexapro,"Hi Everyone,  I am a 22 yr old female and I have been on 10mg of lexapro for 2 weeks now and I thought I'd share my experience although  everyone will react to medication differently. The first three days were awful. Nauseous to the point where I could barely move, terrible headaches, incredible hunger, yawning constantly and waking up all through out the night. On the 4th day most the side effects just stopped. Mostly the headaches and nauseous feeling. You really have to push through the initial side effects. All the racing thoughts immediately stopped, I am so much more calm, no more mood swings, social situations no longer bother me, I am just generally happier. I will also mention that I had none of the sexual side effects.",8,75

Panic attacks every day.  I couldn't control it no more. I broke down and seeked help. My Dr put me on lexpro.  I was super scared at first to take it because of all the storys on the internet about it. I had a few side effects, but nothing to bad.  Best thing I ever did.

Lexapro,"I am updating my last 8 star review of a week or 2 ago below in thread. Update:  The sleep disruption/insomnia  (oftentimes waking 2-4 am and not getting back to sleep) subsided after 3 weeks of starting the generic form of Lexapro (on 10 mg for almost a month).   I am sleeping well again without assistance from Xanax.  I haven't taken X in 5 nights and sleeping my usual 7 hours.  It's wonderful.  No anxiety either.  Give this drug a chance if you can stick out the sleep problems.  It works.  I feel myself again and am not worrying over worrying about anxiety. Not afraid to go anywhere, for fear I'd get that old sense of dread and unease.  I don't even think about it.  It doesn't matter the time of day you take it by the way.",10,74
Lexapro,"Due to my increasing anxiety and panic attacks I was prescribed Lexapro 10mg. During the first few weeks I became very sensitive and would nearly cry over simple things like a customer saying please don't put this item in the bag with that item.... I had very high blood pressure, bad headaches, rapid heart beat, I would feel weak and my body would start shaking (especially my hands). One time I even thought I was having a minor heart attack. I decided to ween off Lexapro and change medication.",1,19
Lexapro,"Last summer I was prescribed lexapro under the name Liberium for my anxiety and depression. I was told to take 10mg once a day, but to ween myself onto it by taking half a pill a day for a week or two. Most of my time on Lexapro was blurry; I couldn't remember a lot. People around me could tell that I wasn't right. I stumbled a lot, slurred my words, and generally felt very irritable. My anxiety was through the roof but I had absolutely no depression. When coming down from the med, about 3 hours before the next dose, I literally couldn't move. Coming off of the med one day gave me a panic attack and what was diagnosed as a pseudo-seizure: non epileptic seizing while remaining completely conscious. I was taken away by force by ambulance.",1,12
Lexapro,"I first started lexapro when I had a massive panic attack in October 2015 it came out of no where and after seeing doctors they disagnosed me with health anxiety.. I'm a mum of 2 and I'm always constantly worrying if I have cancer or if that niggle in my leg was something bad... After my panic attack j was put on 2.5mg and the first week was horrible.. Nauseous, feeling Crap and solo tired... After that I started feeling so much better. I'm not on 15mg and very happy.. I started letting anxiety rule me life and it was turning me into someone I wasnt.. I've always been scared of the stigma of having to me on medication to get me through life however if it helps me be a happier person and a better mum then I'm more then happy with my decision",10,51
Lexapro,"Started Lexapro (Escitalopram) 10 mg taken at 8:00am  2 wks ago for anxiety and mild agoraphobia due to worry over having an anxiety attack-a tsunami of nervousness would overwhelm me and make me fearful and filled with unease. I was always worried about why this was happening to me out of nowhere. And I avoided going to places I once enjoyed. After day 12 a switch flipped.  I felt myself again, happy, easy going, not worried, not anticipating something bad was going to happen. What I cannot handle is the sleep disruption this drug has caused.  Waking at 3, 4 am and unable to get back to sleep.  Dr. prescribed  .50 mg Xanax, which is helping me through this side effect.  Hopefully it will subside when my body adjusts to the serotonin levels",8,29
Lexapro,"All I can say is WOW! After the birth of my son, I developed insomnia and anxiety. I placed a lot of pressure on myself to get enough sleep and the result was not being able to sleep. In addition, I have very high expectations of myself. I work from home and was studying at the time. From this, I caused so much anxiety for myself to the point where I couldn't control my thoughts and feelings. I was prescribed Zoloft which probably made me more anxious and I was on that for a year. My GP switched me to Lexapro 4 months ago.  On this med I feel like a different person. Happy, no anxious thoughts, I am sleeping like a log and am dreaming! I haven't dreamt in years and it's lovely! I have had no side effects on this drugs :)",10,60

Lexapro,"Been on this for roughly 3 weeks. I started taking 10 mgs but I'm currently only taking 2.5 mgs. The first week was a lil bad. I took at night and the med kicked in in like 3 hours. I couldn't sleep, had increased anxiety and it upset my stomach. I cut down to 5 then 2.5. Now I'm fine,  panic attacks are pretty much gone (before I was getting them daily sometimes even 2 or 3 times). The attacks were starting to interfere with work n life n I had to get some help. I tried working out n eating better but it wasn't helping. This works but it takes time. Also, I take this in the mornings with food. It gives me energy so taking at night wasn't good for me bc it would keep me up. Start with a low dose so your body gets used to it.",9,30
Lexapro,"I was told by my psychiatrist to try lexapro 10 mg for my anxiety. I have tried other medications in the past to help with it like Wellbutrin and Zoloft. They didn't help at all  I got side effects right away like  nausa,headaches and dizziness. So I was hoping that lexapro would help where the others didnt. I kept a positive attitude in hopes that it would make me have less anxiety. I took my first pill and 2 hrs later I felt so nauseous that I had trouble standing up without wanting to vomit. Then I starting feeling like my scalp was on fire. Also parts of my skin felt like it had a burning sensation. It didn't go away for the rest of the day. The next day I tried again and the same thing happened I wondered if with EDS if I can't take it",1,2

Lexapro,"I've always been an anxious person, usually I find my anxiety serves me well to stay on top of a busy household, but occasionally the anxiety is destructive instead, like after the birth of a child or difficult times.  I'd had a horrid couple of years, nursing my mum to the end from cancer and eventually it caught up with me, panic attacks, health anxiety, obsession on breathing, palpitations constantly.  I went straight onto 20mg as had been on this drug briefly a decade ago.  The first 24 hours were weird, dizzy, disorientated, mildly nauseous and a huge panic attack. I only slept 3 hours a night for the first 2-3 days. By week 3 I sleep 8hrs a night, have energy during the day and zero anxiety. I feel great! Lexapro is great but be patient",9,55
Lexapro,"I suffer from severe anxiety and panic attacks.  I am on day seven and haven't noticed any improvements, my anxiety  was increased and I am experiencing some dizziness.  However I am going to let the pill take it's course even though it's been hard to continue on it.   My dad took the pill and had success with it so I'm hoping that's the case for me!

I am a 21 year old male, and I've had anxiety for as long as I remember, and on and off depression since I was about 15. This medication works FANTASTICALLY for both anxiety and depression. Both symptoms are at an all time low, and I love this medicine for that. Unfortunately, side effects are present, and for me, never went away. I ALWAYS feel tired on this medicine (as a result, caffeine is my best friend). Because of the side effects, I don't particular recommend this medicine, but everyone's body works differently, and it may be right for you.",6,19

I was prescribed it for social anxiety (despite being a beautiful 6'2 male with no reason to be anxious about appearance) generalized anxiety and panic attacks. Talking to people in malls, convenience stores and being around large groups of people frighten me. I havent noticed much of a difference other than lack of sleep, crazy amazing lucid dreams for the first two nights and my jaw clenching. So far no effect on anxiety and took a benzo because Im feeling restless but still feeling restless right now. I pray this works as Im unable to work now due to my anxiety. Ive always had anxiety but after having mono for 2 months it has spiraled completely out of control. I will update this soon. Please work!",4,25
Lexapro,"I have had three very good experiences with Lexapo. To any readers in deep depression and with anxiety, rule one is to not take bad experiences you read on the web as your future experience.  Each time I have experienced major depression, I started on 10 mg and had to grind my way through at least 4 weeks to feel any positive effects and the worse side effects were gone.  I was bumped up to 20mg and it took two weeks of living through hell again and than suddenly it was gone.   Exercise, get out and face your demons, and remember it can and will get better (yes, hard to believe when they could scrape you off the wall but it will happen). Good luck ... you have my sympathy and encouragement.",9,139
Lexapro,"I have been taking Lexapro 10mgs for nearly 4 months because of anxiety and mild depression. I had about 5 days at first with some dizziness and nausea, after that things smoothed out. Almost immediately it cured my insomnia by 95%.I take it in the morning. In the past, if I woke up at night my thoughts would turn to things that kept me from falling asleep again. As far as anxiety, I am not worrying about things at work so much. I still have some social and anticipatory anxiety, but it is some better than before. Depression is much better; I frequently have a warm feeling of happiness and everything will be alright. Before I felt distressed and flat about the future. So, I would definitely recommend a trial with this medication.",9,54
Lexapro,"Escitalopram has helped me tremendously with panic and anxiety! Want to give hope to others who've been combing forums as I have. Started having panic attacks 6 months ago for no apparent reason. Waited it out hoping they would stop, but only worsened and my life went downhill fast. Dr. gave me Escitalopram 10 mg. with Clonazepam to help with start up effects. The first 10 days were difficult: insomnia, loss of appetite, increased anxiety. These effects disappeared as I hoped and each day I noticed subtle improvements. I am now panic free! Still have small anxiety, but that is human and normal.  So happy that I took action, as I was very afraid. Give this med a chance and give it time to work. I'm sure glad that I did!",10,62
Lexapro,"I have been taking Lexapro for three years now. It has been a miracle. I have not had any panic attacks in over two years. I have a great outlook on life and am totally  comfortable in my own skin. Before I started I had panic attacks regularly. They were so bad that I would have them while driving, at work, while I was trying to sleep. I was a mess. Much, MUCH better with Lexapro.",10,58
Lexapro,"I took Lexapro for almost 4 weeks and quit because it was pure hell. I tried to push through the side effects but they never went away.  Insomnia, couldn't eat, anxiety hit the roof, panic attacks every night, and crazy thoughts. Was not for me.",1,22
Lexapro,"Been on this medicine for around 5 weeks, 10 mg. Been the happiest I have been in awhile! I really love this medication, I have finally got myself out of the darker place I was before. So glad that it's working, and I'm feeling better day to day. Still some anxiety but I can deal with it, depression is completely gone, I can socialize no problem. terrific",8,48
Lexapro,"Lexapro (or the Escitalopram version in my country) was almost immediately successful in treating my anxiety and extreme rage issues. I've been using it for 8 months, but experience one major side-effect: constant tiredness or lethargy. I've tried taking it at other times during the day, but no change. I sleep really well at night, have vivid dreams, am more creative and able to solve problems - if I can stay awake during the day. Get really drowsy two hours after taking this and can easily nap for a couple of hours in the afternoon.  I'm no longer a bitch, but also no longer awake. So will have to choose between being mentally sharp or being anxious and angry all the time.",7,36
Lexapro,"Lexapro changed my life for the better! I had anxiety and needed help. My doctor put me on 15 mg lexapro and the first month was not fun as my body was getting used to the drug. I had dry mouth, sweating and problems sleeping but after a month the side effects went away and I feel normal again. I bumped it down to 10 mg and have been on it for 2 years",9,37
Lexapro,"Began 10mg daily. First day was difficult. Severe mood swings, heightened anxiety, baseless anger, etc. Advise anyone beginning this to 1) begin on a day off and 2) have someone around to keep an eye on you. That ended at the second day, when I only took half-pills. Now that I am a week in, taking the full 10mg and things settling down nicely. Yawning is annoying and my normal night-owl life is riddled with deep, restful sleep, but I am calmer and less angry all the time.",8,60
Lexapro,"I've been taking Lexapro for about 8 months now and it has done me wonders! I have not once had an anxiety attack since, and it has helped me with my depression as well! I highly recommend it!",10,60
Lexapro,I was given Lexapro from my Psych recommended by my therapist for anxiety which I had tried to manage naturally for many yrs by faith workingout meditation yoga and eating healthy. I am 37 suffering with severe panic-anxiety attacks which started while I was pregnant and involved DV with the dad who is a angel dust addict. I was always against taking any kind of meds not even for a headache so the thought of taking a drug everyday was scary I was diagnose with PTSD and anxiety. Its early since I just took my first dose last night and I haven't even experience any real side effects apart from a little tiredness this morning even though I slept 8hrs when I was only sleeping 3-4 at most. I still feel very anxious I will check-in 2-3 wks,5,19
Lexapro,"Feeling alive again but still having panick attacks. I've been on 10mg for the past month  but I noticed every time I have drinks,  the next  day I have nasty pânic attacks. They are awful.  Its been only a month.  Does it get better after 2 months.  I like this medicine, I feel alive again. I wanna jump out of my bed and go to the gym at 6am like before! I haven't felt like this in a year! Before all I wanted to do was sleep and stay attached to my bed.   I love this med but i think I'll need to upper the dose for my anxiety.  :'(",7,34
Lexapro,Omg my expiriance with lexapro was hell. Doc started me of with 10mg and first day I took it after and hour started feeling it it was worse anxiety I've ever experienced and it was just getting worse. After suffering for about 5 hours I had to go to the ER. They had to wheel me in because I almost passed out. I was given 2 mg oh Ativan and Benadryl  and was out bearly remember anything until the next morning. I don't know but that was my expiriance.,0,21
Lexapro,"Did more harm than good. Suicidal ideation regularly even after taken for 4 months. Stomach problems, increased anxiety; and depression onset when I had none prior.",2,17
Lexapro,"I remember reading all these reviews before I took it because I was so scared of the side effects that I might get so I thought I would review it. I know everyone reacts differently but so far this medication has been great. It has slowed down those over thinking anxious feeling's a lot! The side effects were minor. Mild digestive problems, occasional yawning episodes (a bit annoying). The one that is probably the biggest issue is the complete loss of appetite, I just feel like drinking a lot of water. I don't feel hungry and have lost 2kg in the 3 weeks I have been on it.   I am hoping in time these side effects will eventually go away. They are pretty mild and something I can put up with since it is helping me with my anxiety.",9,69
Lexapro,"Changed my life.  Quiets the irrational fears and depression that accompany anxiety disorder.  Taking 10mg/daily.  Weight gain but could also be because I'm happy and eating again.  Also sleep great and feel calm.  No sexual side effects.  Stay with it for 6-8 weeks.  If it doesn't work for you, try another medication until you find the one that clicks.  Don't give up!",10,112
Lexapro,"I was given Lexapro from my GP for anxiety which I had tried to manage naturally the past two years with various techniques to no avail. My panic symptoms were with me everyday and often suffered panic attack episodes.  Made it extremely difficult to do  everyday type stuff let alone work. I  was always drug resistant..the kind  of person who wouldn't even want to  take a headache med so the thought  of a drug therapy I would do everyday was  scary. Anyhow, its early on less  than two weeks and I haven't even  experience any real side effects  apart from a little tiredness first  week. I feel less anxious already, no  attacks and my thoughts aren't looping in my head anymore. I'm  hoping it continues to get better!",9,64
Lexapro,"Stay away from this drug! Or at least if you have had my experience. My side effects was that I had very painful armpit boils. Never before in my life had I had them. I researched signs and symptoms online, and found Lexapro could cause them. I stopped taking Lexapro, and haven't experienced anymore. I would get one or two boils a week. They left ugly, permanent scars. Although, I've found possible laser treatment may remove scars.",1,11
Lexapro,"I am a 24y/o female. I've been taking Lexapro 10mg for almost 4 months now and I can confidently say the only scary thing about this medication is people's negative reviews on it. First and foremost EVERYONE is different, so everyone will react to it differently. I was prescribed it by my primary Doctor due to my severe anxiety and mild depression. Before this medication I was prescribed Celexa, but hated it. My anxiety and depression got so much worse I decided to do something about it. It came to the point where my anxiety and depression affected everyone around me and I just wasn't happy anymore.  At first taking this medication gave me some side affects. My side effects were really dry mouth, some intense dreams, and some loss of appetite. The only thing that has stuck for these few months have been the dreams. They seems SO REAL! But I can say I rather have some dreams than those scary anxiety attacks I use to get, and those depressed bed sobs. Lexapro has changed my life! Before this medication my life was hitting rock bottom. My Anxiety was so severe it took over my life. I obsessed over everything, overthought everything, felt like at any moment I was going to die. I was on edge every second. My blood pressure was always high and I'm only 24! I had this obsession of dying in a car accident, it came to a point I couldnt ride in a car with anyone else unless I was driving. If I did I would get panic attacks. My depression was also bad and also had an eating disorder. I felt like I was never going to be happy. Was never going to be happy in a relationship, or in my job, or even be able to hug my own mother again. I'm happy the people in my life noticed how much my disorders were taking over my life and helped me make a change. Lexapro helped my life. I hope my review will change yours.",10,282
Lexapro,"I took this for several years. I would occasionally switch to something else, but I always came back to it. While effective, it caused me to gain a lot of weight.",8,34
Lexapro,"I was prescribed this drug for occasional anxiety issues, related to pressure at work. I took it during an extremely stressful time where I experienced extraordinary anxiety. The first day it helped me quite a lot, by taking away the negative feeling in my chest and making me more relaxed and social. Later in the day, it made me very awake, without impairing my sleep. I took it for another 4-5 days every day in 2.5-10mg to try with different dosage. The positive impact faded and I got serious problems with side effects. I could hardly sleep any longer and the combination with diphenhydramin (sleeping pill) made it even worse, by excessively reducing my heart rate and respiratory condition. The last 2 days i hardly slept, due to 'hypnic jerks",5,21
Lexapro,Bad experience. Bad sleep.,3,12
Lexapro,Have been on Lexapro for two years now. First weeks were truly horrible and took 6-8 weeks for full effect. But hang in there! My life is finally anxiety free and I enjoy the smallest things. I see now how much place and energy the anxiety took before. Not anymore. No side effects. Take it at night to avoid sexual side effects. (Had them when I took Lex in the morning.),10,71
Lexapro,"My 15 yr old daughter has multiple diagnoses. ODD. ADD. Anxiety and Depression. We have used several different meds over the last few months to aid with behavioral issues like constant anger and opposition with occasional explosive outbursts of anger and focus &amp; concentration in school. She has been on 10 mg Lexapro daily for a little over a week and I can see a huge difference in her already. I feel like I have my daughter back. We can have a conversation without an argument. She seems so much more peaceful and generally happy. I see so much of a difference, I don't think she even needs the Daytrana patch for ADD now. Other meds we have tried are Effexor, Concerta, Adderall, &amp; Stratera.",10,48
Lexapro,"I have been in a really bad funk for as long as I can remember and have been through a good amount. I won't go into details because its not relevant. Also felt like my brain was foggy and mind constantly racing. I have social anxiety as well. I am on day two of lexapro and I think it's working already. I feel warm inside, peaceful and am interacting with people so easily. It's strange. I can't explain it bit I feel peaceful, happy and not anxious. I haven't felt this way in a long time. I get drowsy and my eyes get heavy randomly through out the day. I've also started smiling randomly. I know this is sort of vague, I wanted to be straight to the point. I really hope this is it and I have found the right medicine and hope this lasts!",8,81
Lexapro,"I have been on a few other anti-anxiety meds over the past decade.  The last one I was on was an absolute nightmare, so I vowed to NEVER take meds again.  Since then, I tried natural remedies, exercise etc. to combat this constant agitation and anxiety I have been feeling.  I couldn't really be in the moment and enjoy.  I've been on 10 mg. of Lexapro for over 2 months now and haven't felt this good in a forever (it seems).  I feel normal again and I actually want to get out and do things.  I see now how severely depressed/anxious I have been for so long.  This medication has given me my life back.  I have not gained any weight, thus far and have stayed the same.  Everyone is different, so I feel very lucky that this is working for me.",10,111
Lexapro,I got on this med Sept.2015. I had anxiety mixed with fear to take it. I am on the 10 mg dose and get depressed and anxiety when on it. Slowly it worsened to the point I couldn't attend school. I this normal!? I have experienced the lack of wanting to eat and hating food in the start of being on it.Then my hunger spiked past its norm; I was eating like there was no tomorrow. Now being close to Xmas and off it for a bit I feel more snappy. If you are/ have experienced this I hope this helped.,3,18
Lexapro,"I've tried many medications for anxiety, panic disorder, social phobia etc. I was previously on Zoloft for 3 months with nasty side effects. I started 5mg of Lexapro on 11/13/15 and after the first day I saw significant improvement, 2 weeks later I was at 10mg. I'm able to go places without panicking, and I'm more social. The only side effect I have is nausea and gas but Zofran helps with that. Today I will be increasing my dose to 20mg. So far it's done awesome for me. I hope it continues to get better.",9,36
Lexapro,Hi i just started Lexapro 3 days ago 5mg for anxiety and I must say I think I feel worse then I did before I took it. I feel all shakey and feel a bit down and I have gone off my food is this normal has anyone else felt like this ?,5,36
Lexapro,"I was put on this for my panic disorder  because i was suffering from panic attacks  while driving because of a bad car wreck I had. Anyways my doctor put me on 10mgs when I took it in the day I was so drowsy and out of it I couldn't function. So I switched to taking it before bed and I would wake up every night with dizzy spells and heart beating out my chest. It would take a hour for those symptoms to go away and for me to continue my sleep. Then during the day I would have extreme anxiety I couldn't be behind the wheel of a car without panicking, I couldn't go out to the store without panicking I was only on it for 10 days the worst 10 days of my life and honestly I feel better now that I'm off this horrible drug",2,19
Lexapro,"I posted in Oct. My 9 yr. Old has Aspergers and my life was hard. It is now the last week of month 2 on 10mg. of Lexapro. OMG!!! Is this what normal really feels like!? Please.. if you have anxiety and possible depression give this drug a chance. I feel like a new person. I laugh at shows now, I have a sense of humor again. My spouse is spending more time around me since I am more pleseant to be around. I cooked a small Thx giving dinner for 4 from  scratch in 4 hours without stressing it. I can watch sad movies and feel  the emotions but not cry through the whole show or movie.  Find myself interested in things I used to enjoy but stopped. I am glad I hung in and listened to others who said to give it 6-8 weeks for full effect.They were right.:)",10,136
Lexapro,I was having terrible anxiety out of the blue at age 59 they anxiety lasted all day and into the evening for one month. I was on Prozac and the doctor put me on Lexapro instead and my anxiety was gone by the third day of taking it! It has worked wonderfully for me I feel normal again and not so fearful!,10,60
Lexapro,"I'm 19 years old and I've had anxiety since I was a kid. When my family would sing happy birthday to me, I would have a panic attack and cry. I cried every day my kindergarden year. My anxiety got worse over the years but my parents are those types that don't believe in medication and mental disorders. This year, since being an adult and being able to make my own decisions, I decided to see a therapist. They started me out on 5mg lexapro. The first month was like heaven. I could hold conversations with strangers, go to restaurants and not have a panic attack trying to order food, and so on. After that first month the medicine just stopped working. I was tired and sick all the time and it made me have horrible bursts of anger. Don't take this!!",1,18
Lexapro,"I took this after being on Zoloft for anxiety &amp; social phobia. Zoloft didn't work (I was on it for about 4 weeks and it gave me terrible headaches, couldn't sleep, but felt tired all the time). After about 2 weeks of being on Lexapro, I got severe anxiousness and anger and rage. I had it for 3 days straight and my husband told me to call the doc and get off the meds. I also was dizzy all the time so much that I couldn't stand up without having to immediately sit down because of the world spinning. I'm switching over to Efexxor now and hoping that will help.",2,14
Lexapro,I suffer from major anxiety and panic attacks.  My dr started me on 5mg of lexapro and been taking it for 6 days now. Im not sure if I should continue the medication. Im having weird feelings in my chest tightness fluttering feeling that makes me cough. Also I feel a lot of pressure in my head and daily headaches. It causes more anxiety for me so taking xanax to help.  Anyone having these side effects?,0,35
Lexapro,I've had serious anxiety since I was a teen. In the last 4 years (thanks to some random health issues) it has skyrocketed and life has become unbearable. Everyday I thought I was having a heart attack - despite stellar cardio results. Anxiety took full control of my life - mentally and physically. Xanax and booze (not together) work like a charm but I fear the addiction potential. My doc put me on low dose of Lexapro (5 mg) and within 48 hours all my crazy anxiety ended. Gone. I feel normal again - it's been YEARS since I've felt this way. Small sexual side effect (long time to ejaculate) and slight weight gain but I'm ok with that. Another side effect: my co-workers &amp; friends like me again.,10,79
Lexapro,"I am 19 years old. I had severe panic attacks before dates and would get sick right in front of them. Also, had trouble talking to higher ups at work. My doc put me on 10 mg Lexapro for social anxiety disorder. Worked right away after the first dose. Takes away all pain and worrying. The only bad thing is I feel like my life is all in slow motion and can't be bothered about anything. Puts you in your happy place. No need to suffer anymore, there is an answer!",9,55
Lexapro,I was having a lot of anxiety over trying to raise my RAD (Reactive attachment disorder) niece.  I didn't feel depressed just anxious and had panic attacks. Her and I were in a power struggle. This med helped me relax and pick my battles and not get over zealous about thing. The bad thing is within 5 months I gained 15 pounds not changing my eating habits at all. The 6th month I tried to lose weight and could not so I went back and got on something else.,6,16
Lexapro,"I suffer from severe social and general anxiety. Started on lexapro about a month ago. Took 10mg daily for 3 and 1/2 weeks with little results. I would always check these reviews because I saw how much it had changed many people's lives so I was trying to stay optimistic. side affects were tough the first week but went away quickly. Not much help with anxiety, all I really noticed was a cloudy headed feeling all day. Don't give up taking it though! This drug does wonders for many people.",5,25
Lexapro,"Hi. I am on day 16 of 10mg. The first 6 days I was very tired, excessively. But the majority of my anxiety was gone by then.  Days 6-8 I had severe insomnia, it passed and by day 9 I had no racing thoughts before going to slep. Today is day 16. I feel better about my life circumstances. I have a 9 year old with Aspergers. I am no longer spending every waking moment obsessing over what will become of his future. My cognitve functioning seems clearer.  Have been able to keep up more with home chores. Still not as energised as I would like to be. Coffee makes me more jittery since starting the meds. I can now tell the differnce between caffeine jitters and my real anxiety though. I am hoping that by week 6-8 I have even more clarity.",10,46
Lexapro,"This medicine absolutely almost ruined my life, to the point I was going to lose EVERYTHING.  It made me nauseous,  tired,  loss of sex drive , made me want to drink 24/7 all because I DIDN'T CARE ANYMORE!  I lost 2 jobs, because I had no desire to function basically.  I have been off it for 2 weeks now now and the side effects from coming off this medication is not bad at all.  I feel happy again,  a little anxiety but omg I'll deal with it the natural way. ...exercise or just enjoy my family again.",1,22
Lexapro,"I started Lexapro the summer before my sophomore year of college and have now been on it for about 6 months now. It worked pretty well in the first month, my anxiety went down but after that it felt useless. We upped the dosage all the way from I think 5mg to 20mg by the end of the summer and still felt useless. I decided to continue taking Lexapro as I went back to college and I still felt like it was not working. I still felt really anxious and on edge all the time so I decided to go to the school's psychiatry center, which during my screening they told me that Lexapro is actually known for dying out over time. I stopped taking it and my anxiety is through the roof. Overall, it helped me but not as much as I'd liked it to",5,21
Lexapro,"Incredible medication. I don't wake up in a panic  anymore, whereas it was occurring almost daily before. The first few days for me were hell, but I just slept through the headache and nausea and dizziness and now it's one of the best things that's ever happened for me regarding my anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Reduced daily anxiety = less panic attacks. Lexapro is awesome.",10,60
Lexapro,"I have been on this med for 3 months. 10mg a day I can't sleep and I cry alot. My tightness in my chest is gone, but I still feel blah.",1,16
Lexapro,"I have been dealing with general and situational anxiety disorder and panic attacks on and off since college.  Tried Paxil and Prozac. Paxil made me gain 20 lbs. and Prozac increased my anxiety.  Lexapro works. My advice: Try taking Lexapro for at least one week. The first week you will feel tired, dizzy, and mildly nauseated. Those effects disappear very quickly.  Do start at 5mg and slowly increase to 10 or 20mg. Ask you doctor to supplement with Buspar XL which counteracts most Lexapro side effects and further helps control anxiety and panic attacks. I don't recommend using Lexapro without Buspar.  Anxiety/Panic will gradually disappear over two to four weeks.  Use Ativan or other Benzodiazapines sparingly until Lexapro is working.",10,56
Lexapro,I am a young and small person who was in search for a medication to control my depression but mostly my anxiety and OCD tendencies. I had tried Lexapro before also mixed with Buspar but it never seemed to fully do the trick; it felt like I was taking a pill and not getting much from it. Prozac has caused maybe a 5 lb fluctuation in my weight and it did decrease my sex drive for about the first 6 to 8 months but I feel that is just the amount of time necessary to get used to the new drug. This has been the only effective solution to my illness.,8,20
Lexapro,"For the past four months I have had terrible anxiety and multiple terrifying panic attacks per day. I was having to take more and more lorazepam just to get through the day. My doctor prescribed Lexapro. I was nervous because I had read such horrible things about the side effects and I really didn't want to go through it, but Lexapro has been great for me! The anxiety disappeared on the first day and I was more chilled out than I have been in years. I was weak and tired and had no appetite but that is all as far as side effects. I am very happy with how I feel and my anxiety free life!",10,78
Lexapro,"lexapro helped me tremendously, it basically saved my life. I was horrified before I started, because of course I went online to see reviews and the side effects but all I got was bad experiences but mine has been amazing. I feel so much better, so much more free, like I'm actually living again. I lost a little weight from it (which is a plus) and I feel great! I hope this helps for some people!",6,75
Lexapro,"Works great for GAD.  I fought my feelings for years and just toughed it out.  I found myself drinking to ease my symptoms.  The drinking helped turn my brain off for the night, but the feelings just came back the next day.  Finally told my doctor about my symptoms and was prescribed Lexapro.  Within 48 hours the anxiety was dramatically reduced, no excessive sweating, mind racing, etc.  This drug is a god send.  10 mg works best for me, tried 20 but couldn't feel the difference.  Now just have to deal with the drinking.",10,63
Lexapro,"This medication has been very effective for me. After years and years of living with anxiety and doing all the right things to get rid of it organically, I finally bit the bullet and started on 5mg. Decided after a particularly bad month of anxiety to start a script I had been given a year ago. Read reviews, most of them saying you need to stick it out to pass the side effects and get the full benefit, so that's what I did. I took the 5mg for a week, went up to 10, and have now been on it for 3 whole months. The initial side effects were as follows: nausea, sleepiness, memory deficits (short-term), headaches. Those went away after 2 months. And anxiety is gone. I am calm and collected, I no longer sweat the small stuff. No insomnia.",9,75
Lexapro,"So basically since I was around 20 (I'm 36 now) I've suffered from general anxiety and horrible panic attacks, really bad hypochondria. I've gone to the hospital thinking I was dying of everything. I graduated from an Ivy League college and suffered the entire time. Finally I decided to bite the billet and try lexapro (brand name not generic). I started at 10mg and had a week of terrible side effects including: depression, couldn't cry, weird feelings hard to describe, insomnia, increased anxiety, fatigue, all around shaky feeling. I couldn't deal with it so I started to cut the pills in half to 5 mg- side effects went away except I have increased libido (it gets annoying). No panic attacks. Still have anxiety a little tiny bit.",9,37
Lexapro,"I was diagnosed with anxiety after having several bouts of severe anxiety and many lesser episodes. On two occasions I went to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack. My Dr. prescribed Lexapro. I don't recall any of the issues other describe and after two weeks or so, I was feeling much better and only sufferred from a few smaller episodes. I have noticed that heavy drinking is a disaster while on this med and results in me feeling ill and panic. I have had no other side effects. I did run out for nearly a week once and did feel some negative feelings coming on. I do not plan to run out ever again. I have taken 10 mg since the start three years ago. Avoid heavy drinking!",8,29
Lexapro,"Been on Lexapro for 2 days.  Horrible nausea, headache.  My husband asked the pharmacist about help with this.  She recommended an over-the-counter liquid called Ematrol.  Used by children and adults.  It helped.  Also sipped ginger ale as needed.  Feel very out-of-body, shaky but trying to stick it out as everyone seems to say the first day/week is hell, but then all is good.  Am continuing on Klonopin, per my psychiatrist's recommendation, until the Lexapro kicks in.  Will try taking it at night, as this seems easier to ride out the side effects through sleep.",2,25
Lexapro,"Absolutely ineffective for my GAD....stuck with it for a year based on pdoc advice. Now I have to deal with tapering. What a mistake that has been.  Additionally, I have tried several other ssri's as well as a few ssri's all to no avail. Suicidal thoughts, intolerable side effects, lack of any efficacy.   Without Benzodiazepan's I would not be here now.",1,12
Lexapro,"I read these reviews which helped me to make a decision to take this med so I will add my experience in the hopes it will help others. I am 56, male and had two minor heart attacks 6 months ago. That and a very stressful job caused many sleepless nights and some stress and anxiety. My Doctor suggested lexipro a few times and I finally decided to give it a try. I was prescribed 10 mg and broke them in half as a trial so 5 mg to start.The first 2-3 days I felt no change but by day 3-4 the side effects kicked in hard. Nausea, severe hot flashes, fullness and tightness in chest, fogginess, very anxious feelings. I decided to stop after 6 days and was worried about any withdrawal but the day I stopped I felt much better. just my experience.",1,37
Lexapro,"I've been on Lexapro for 2 years. Just recently switched to Effexor and Klonopin. Lexapro never really did much for me. At first, after the 2-week adjustment to the medicine which was hell, I thought it worked. But it may have just been placebo more than the medicine. Had multiple serious near life-changing anxiety attacks while on Lexapro which is why I switched. I couldn't be happier for switching. If you have anxiety, don't waste your time with an SSRI. Also, I've stopped taking lexapro multiple times. It's not too hard, you get aggravated at everything for a few days, the brain shocks aren't nearly as bad as people say they are.",4,23
Lexapro,"On my fourth day now taking this and I feel so much better. The first 2 days were hell for me. Side effects just like everybody else says. I felt like I was dizzy, nauseous, and had diarrhea. It just made me feel strange. But by the third day I felt amazing. I still felt a little weird at first but the side effects wore off quickly and then and began to stop overthinking things so much. It's almost as if I just started to feel at peace with everything like I was just laid back which is not how I ever was. No more of that chest pain or heavy breathing or sickening nervous feeling. Even my girlfriend could notice a difference in me as I was not so wound up about everything. just happy I can feel normal again",10,79
Lexapro,"I encountered a bout of hypochondria when Doctors couldn%u2019t diagnose some pain I was having.  Slight worry turned into full-blown panic attacks and daylong anxiety.  With anxiety comes a bunch of physical symptoms and I was certain each one of those symptoms was more proof of me having some sort of undiscovered health condition, feeding into the anxiety.  My physician suggested I try going on Lexapro for 6 months and I was at the end of my rope so I reluctantly agreed.  Side effects were horrible but they went away and within 1 month of my first dose I was completley back to normal.  I've now been off it for 6 months and its like my entire episode never happened.  Lexapro saved my life.",9,79
Lexapro,"I love this medication! I have been on it for about a year and it has made my life so much better.  I had been living with severe anxiety and depression.  After starting lexapro, I had some side effects such as the weird dreams, nausea, dizziness, and increased anxiety.  After 2 weeks, I started to feel so much better!  I now have less anxiety and I have not had a panic attack in 6 months! It is amazing how great I feel.  Finally, I can live my life like a normal 24 year old!  My advice to anyone who is on this medicine is to stay on it!  It is worth it!",10,111
Lexapro,"I am 28. I have been on this medicine now for 6 months being treated for sever OCD and anxiety. In 6 months time I have gained 30 ish pounds, my Sex drive is gone, I can not sleep at night (horrible and weird dreams), and I still can not stop thinking of a million and one things before I go to bed (example: I need to make my bed, dishes done, kids set for the next day,)  I am tired all the time and I have no energy anymore for anything. I feel like I'm a different person. However I am not as bad with my OCD as I was before taking it, I am actually calm at night rather than worried if something will happen, I am just all around calmer. I am up in the air with this drug because it does seem to work but am I too calm. I am not really myself.",5,18
Lexapro,"I just finished reading all these reviews about Lexapro, just prior I was reading all the reviews from people trying to get off Lexapro.. Crazy the things people go thru to get on this medication and then just as crazy the things you go thru to get off it. So what to do???? I have been on Lex for approx. 18 months my Dr put me on when there was a lot going on in my life and i told 'I had shopping cart rage :)  among others issues. I too went thru all the crap in the beginning and felt just stick it out. I did and I survived and things seemed better. fast forward 18 months later I thought my life has calmed down and I wanted off the meds. I also have Ambien and Xanax that I take as needed which isn't often. I ask my Dr about getting off",8,12
Lexapro,"Don't try it, withdrawal is horrible. 5 days, no relief.",1,9
Lexapro,"I started to get anxiety when I went back to work. I was prescribed lexapro by my doctor and started 3 days ago.  A lot of the reviews say to keep sticking with it so I plan too. As far as the side effects, I get the nausea and dizziness but it's not so severe that I can't function. I do however, feel like I'm constantly zoning out and just staring out into space sometimes. I do notice I yawn a lot too and my lower jaw feels really tense all the time. Does anyone else have this problem? I'm going to keep sticking with this drug. There is such good reviews once the side effects subside and your body adjusts to it.",5,38
Lexapro,"I feel that this medication did decrease my anxiety (I have social anxiety) and made me feel less nervous in a lot more situations. I went on roller coasters and felt nothing for the most part. The only bad thing is that this medicine wrecked my sleeping patterns. I usually will wake up 7-8 hours after I fall asleep, but now I wake up maybe 10-11 hours after. I am sure that would be fine if I were 12, but I am not. I am so used to the way I have slept for so long that it feels pretty horrible to be such a heavy sleeper.",5,16
Lexapro,I started 10mg lexapro 5 days ago for anxiety. I had been free from mirtazapine for about 9 days before starting. At first I though I had a tummy bug and stayed in bed the next day.... 5 days later and I'm still in bed and yesterday spoke with my doc who said to stop taking them. I was a complete nervous wreck... more than I had ever been without meds. Neither of the previous 2 meds (paxtine and mirtazapine) had side effects like this. This med is not for me sadly.,3,20
Lexapro,"I started having bad anxiety after I went back to work. I started on lexapro 5mg. I'm glad I stuck with it. Yes the side effects for the first 6 weeks were hell but after week 6 they ALL went away. I had every side effect too. But reading the reviews from people who said to stick it out it's worth it is what kept me going. After week 6 I went up to 10mg and was worried I was going to experience the side effects again. But nope no side effects. My anxiety is gone and I'm coming out of that black hole I was in. So please anyone reading this , yes stick with it! The start up side effects will go away. I had increased anxiety when I first started taking it but that too stopped. I am on the generic as well.",10,152
Lexapro,"I've recently suffered a relationship breakdown. My anxiety eventually spiralled out of control to the point I walked out of my job, life &amp; all responsibilities to return home like a child.  OCD negative thoughts, inability to go 2 days without crying, constant fear of anxiety returning, weight loss and inability to sleep / function basically LIVE!! I was SO scared of the horror stories but at rock bottom there's nowhere but up right? I have been on 5mg for 4 days now. Taking it before bed. First night very nauseous, the next day feeling tired, teary &amp; distracted. However, I have noticed a general improvement in my mood after 4 days. A good day yesterday and terrible today. BUT! I'm persevering. Thanks all for positive stories. :o)",3,46
Lexapro,"I love lexapro. I started taking it when I was 14 from severe anxiety and OCD. My doctor basically begged my parents to put me on medication because I could not leave the house. I'm now 20 years old and about 6 months ago I thought I no longer needed the lexapro because I was feeling better. WHAT A MISTAKE. After the taper my OCD came back just as bad as it was when I was 14. So my Pdoc put me on prozac. It made me manic. I then tried Brintellix, again it made me crazy. So I went back to the lexapro and yes the start up side effects suck, headache, dizzy (that woosh feeling in you brain), upset stomach and brain fog, and every time I bumped  up the dose I had an increase in anxiety, but after 5 weeks I finally have my life back. Stick it out!!!!",9,77
Lexapro,"I'm introverted and suffered some depression and anxiety due to a recent IRS audit and personal problems at home , I landed in the hospital for 4 days after test on my heart etc everything cleared but stress and anxiety , I'm 40 and in good shape , Dr put me on Lexapro , first two weeks were brutal , emotional rollercoster and insomia, I asked my Dr if he was sure these were not estrogen pills. After two weeks I started to feel awesome , better then before I'm on my eighth week and lost weight , motivated to go to gym , tolerate my wife's extroverted friends , I feel better then I did my entire life , even before my depression issues , crowds and loud people go over my head nothing irritates me anymore , sexual sides I last longer win win",9,87
Lexapro,"I started on 10 mg of Lexapro in October 2014. I stayed on that dose for 2 months and felt horrible the whole time. Nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, severe gas, and more anxiety. I lowered to 5mg and finally started to feel like myself. Long story short, I raised back up to 10 mg in April 2015 and haven't felt this good in years. Most all side effects gone. I have it a 10 because I couldn't hardly leave my house before. I'm finally living again. It is a process, but don't quit and don't give up. Its worth the results to stick with it.",10,69
Lexapro,"I noticed pretty good results within two weeks- my general anxiety lowered significantly, but I still get frequent panic attacks.",9,19
Lexapro,Lexapro saved my life and saved my mind.  I have pure OCD and anxiety.  I tried other anxiety medications before and was ready to give up.  My primary doctor recommended I try Lexapro. I started off at 10mg and started to feel better after a month or two but was still having compulsions from my OCD (although much fewer) so I asked my Doctor to up my medication.  She put me on 20mg and I have been on 20mg for more than six months now.  My life has changed.  I have never felt so alive and so real.  I have never felt so sane.  I can function for the first time in ten years at the degree someone normal functions act.,10,88
Lexapro,Lexapro is great. I started when my panic attacks and depression made me unable to function at all and I was too afraid to leave my house. My thoughts would race and I was just a mess. I started on 5mg for a week which was like nothing but then upped to 10mg and after 3 weeks I was beginning to feel less anxious and more stable. After 6 weeks I'd say I felt normal. I'm going to try come off them after being on them for a year and a half. I haven't had a panic attack in over a year so for panic disorder they work fantastically well. I've experienced no side effects with this drug.,10,93
Lexapro,"This is the first time I have ever posted a review of anything online, but I feel an obligation to share my experience to other suffering with anxiety. I suffer from GAD which included panic attacks, muscle aches, and a horrible temper.  I avoided this medication fearing weight gain (as I already gained 10 lbs over the year) and sexual dysfunction.  When I explained this to my doctor, he replied Have you ever considered whether being anxious has caused you to eat more, drink more, and maybe have sex less often?. I have been on Lexapro for 6 months now, and my only regret is not starting this treatment sooner. I have lost 15 lbs as I don't eat and drink as much anymore, and my love life has improved. Anxiety sucks. You don't have to suffer!",10,176
Lexapro,"I have suffered from mild depression/moderate to severe anxiety for several years now. I married for the second time January 2014 (blended family) which started to exacerbate all my issues!  Runaway thoughts of scenarios that might happen and how I would react.  Very emotionally unstable.  Tendency to over-react immediately to minor situations (plus the run away thoughts start....) and would physically have to calm myself down.  Easily irritated. Finally went to my Dr. and she put me on 10 mg Lexapro last week. The effects were evident withing 24 hours.  No immediate over reaction, run away negative thoughts almost completely gone....wow.  How could a little pill make such a huge difference?!?",9,85
Lexapro,"This medication was a game changer for me.  After trying Prozac, Zoloft and Celexa with no effect I thought I was destined to have panic attacks for the rest of my life. Celexa even worsened my anxiety, causing my to go to the emergency room twice.  At the time i started Lexapro, i was having debilitating symptoms, atleast 1 to 2 panic attacks a day with racing heart, racing thoughts, generally feeling like I was losing my goddamn mind. After a month of the Lexapro my anxiety began to calm, I have now been on it for 3 years and am relatively symptom free. I still experience heightened anxiety and the occationally panic attack but it is so much more managable and I am able to apply coping skills successfully.",9,62
Lexapro,"I had anxiety symptoms such as dreading work daily, and physical symptoms such  as lack of energy and almost a  dizziness feeling that would start a few hours into my day and continue until I was home relaxing. This medicine has improved mostly all of my symptoms, except for the occasion day that is very stressful. I would recommend to anyone, and cannot imagine going off any time soon. Hope this helps someone else.",8,67
Lexapro,"Had extreme anxiety, panic attacks, couldn't ever sleep and excessive worrying.  Lexapro helped immediately I went from 10 mg to eventually 20mg it helped so much but I gained about 15 lbs.  I craved sweets and carbs all the time!  My Dr. told me to try to go back to 10mg but then I became very irritable, so I went back to 20mg for months.  Just last night I tried 15mg...Wow!  My appetite is normal, no food binges, no sleepy fog, no anxiety, and my energy already feels normal!!  It is only the first day, but I am hoping this dose is my permanent one.  Before Lexapro I was getting a lot of OCD type scary thoughts that would not leave my mind-made me feel like I was going crazy and now my Dr. discovered I have a genetic factor. Lifer -Lexapro",10,55
Lexapro,I've had terrible anxiety and stress problems for a few years. I've been on this medication for 2 weeks and I can feel the difference all ready .. The first week was weird... Trippy . I'm on 10mg and I'm so happy my constant worry is going.. I'm free to live again,9,64
Lexapro,"I have had mild social anxiety and depression throughout my entire adult life, but as I quit smoking a couple of years ago, both the anxiety and depression ramped up to the point that they were unbearable.  I was afraid to leave my house, afraid to  go out in public, afraid of was what to come next, as my condition was getting worse day by day.  My doctor saw right away that something was wrong and prescribed me Lexapro, 10mg a day.  Ive never been a fan of taking anti depressants or any pills for that matter, but felt like had no choice.  During the six months I took Lexapro my confidence skyrocketed, I learned to be at ease in any situation and felt great.  Stopped after 6 months, but the anxiety nor depression never returned.  love it",10,116
Lexapro,"I was terribly bullied in high school, made fun of my sexuality and developed an extremely high amount of social anxiety. I would shudder at the thought of going to school. I had lost hope.  Visited a psychiastrist. Was prescribed Escitalopram. The medicine did not seem as if it was working in the first few months.  I was given anti anxiety medicines too so I always credited them whenever I felt better. However,  it has almost been an year and now I am only on Escitlopram. I realised I do not need to take any medicine at all because I am just soo confident. I realised that i am suddenly not at all hesitant to go for movies or anywhere Confidence = restored and depression = forgotten.",9,41
Lexapro,"Please, please give it a chance to work. The first week my anxiety ramped up. A few days in I was so sick in the morning I was concerned I may be pregnant (nope, the meds did it). But the nausea subsided and the anxiety slowed down and at about 5 weeks in it was basically gone. Xanax helped, but I no longer need it now. Prior to this I felt like the walls were closing in on me. I couldn't focus and I was filled with terror and unreality. Lexapro made these symptoms go away. I don't have constant thoughts and I don't live 'in my head'. Please give it a chance. Stick it out, I promise it worth it,  if you felt anything like I did you deserve to feel better and it saved me from the looney bin. I have my life back. 5 mgs. to start and now on 10",9,105
Lexapro,"I am a 36 year old female. I have been on Lexapro for 4 months now, and It has definitely helped to change my life for the better.  I had crippling anxiety and depression, and finally went to the dr when it reached the point that I could not leave the house to go to work (some days) or even to the grocery store.  The first two weeks I took 10 mg/day and now I am on 20 mg/day.At first it made me sort of loopy and low sex drive but those things evened out.   I wish I would have started it sooner.  Please give this medicine a try if you have depression or anxiety.",9,56
Lexapro,"After many, many, many medications, this is the ONLY one that has ever helped!",10,55
Lexapro,"I have been on 10mg of Lexapro 3 days. Day one: I was really dizzy and couldn't keep my eyes open. Day 2: was awful. I kept throwing up a few hours after taking it. It felt like a hangover and flu mixed. Everything hurt. By the end of day 2 I noticed I wasn't spending my day planning, thinking, and breaking down tiny details. I was in the moment. It was a little boring at times but it was extremely refreshing. It was amazing to want to go do things without having to make sure everything was thought of. There were no rushes of chest pains. I felt like I should tell everyone how wonderful it was like not be consumed by thought. Day 3: light dizziness and sore muscles. light anxiety after an argument and a concert. I have very high hopes now.",10,64
Lexapro,"Made my anxiety even worse, was unable to make it past a couple weeks.",1,18
Lexapro,"I had crippling anxiety for about a decade (childhood to early twenties). Panic attacks, social anxiety, and generalized anxiety were some of the titles I had gotten. Bottom line I couldn't interact with others, perform simple tasks, speak in public, make eye contact, the list goes on. I had HORRIBLE anxiety panic and depression for years. I developed a pretty serious drinking problem because I was not being treated for anxiety! I was suicidal and finally sought help. Lexapro 10mg at first. I didn't feel different the first month or so. You need to give Lexapro time! I am 100% a different person. People think I am calm, confident, and put together. I feel no panic. No irrational anxiety. It saved my life.",10,109
Lexapro,"Lexapro made everything worse for me. Had horrible side effects! Teeth clinching, headaches, zombie like, no energy, insomnia and horrible nightmares. Had to stop after 3 days.",1,22
Lexapro,I've suffered from severe social anxiety and depression for quite some time. I was always terrified of going on pills and wanted to figure it out mentally. I always denied I needed help. It's gotten so bad recently that I struggle to leave the house. I'm only 17!! I went to the doctor and he prescribed me 10mg of Lexapro. I'm an emetophobic and one of the possible side effects was nausea so that was almost a deal breaker for me. I don't think I've experienced real side effects apart from difficulty reaching orgasm and headaches. My phobia makes me feel like I'm gettin side effects when I'm not- good old anxiety. Been on them for 2 days and am praying it gets better.,6,13
Lexapro,"Absolutely saved my life. After having severe facial pain for 3 months and not one doctor could diagnose me... I started have bad anxiety and depression. I was always that person that was so against anti depressants and anxiety medicine. My family kept telling me I needed to do something so I finally decided to take Lexapro! I have been on it for a little over 2 months and it was the best decision I've made. It has made me mentally relax and when any issues arise I'm able to think about it calmly and rationally, when before I would panic over everything. The first week the side effects were pretty bad, so make sure you take an anxiety medication with it.               (For 2 weeks -1 month) until the side effects disappear. Highly recommend",10,24
Lexapro,"Lexapro has given me my life back. Now I'm back to work, back at the gym, socializing, running errands - all things that for the past year I could not do. I feel more at ease with life in general and my depression has also lifted. My husband has noted that I'm much easier to get along with and in turn he is happier. I've tried other meds in the past but this has worked wonders for me. I started on 5mg then after 2 months I went to 10mg. No weight gain at all, sleeping better and smiling more.",10,43
Lexapro,"This med is amazing. 23 year old christian college grad with every type of anxiety for the past 2 years. Could barely go to class or the grocery store, felt dissociated, distant and terrified of people (including friends). Was scared to try any drug but after losing my job and needing to go out and interview I decided to try something. 3 days in and I feel totally changed. No anxiety. Clear head. Feel like I could even move countries to work and I've been out more in a weekend than I have been in 3 months combined. I take 5mg and 25mg of hydroxyzine to balance out the side effects (blurry vision, headaches, muscle spasms etc). Don't be scared just try it. I regret not going on this sooner.",10,26

Lexapro,"I have been on Lexapro 10 mg  for a year and a half for depression and anxiety, along with generic remeron 15mg as sleep aid. Last summer I switched to only generic remeron (mirtrazipine) and my mood started to go up and down.  The thing with lexapro is it takes away inhibition. That also includes being more impulsive. So be careful when upset. It also ramped up anxiety in the first couple of weeks  and drives you nuts. I am getting back slowly on lexapro for 2 weeks. I got a few anxiety crisis so I take half 10mg and will try to increase slowly. Despite this minus, this is the best thing so far. BTW, generic escitalopram sucks. Tried and doesn't do the trick for  me.",10,8
Lexapro,"Hi started this medication Cipro 2.5 years ago only 5mg. I had side effects to start including joint pain, Brain zaps, dizziness but it passed after 4-7 days and I have been back to myself working a full time job, driving again and living my life. Recommend it for sure.",10,20
Lexapro,"I've been on Lexapro for probably 7 years now. I've had severe anxiety, panic attacks, mood issues, EDs, and depression for a long time. Lexapro has helped immensely. I had side effects for the first few weeks (night sweats, felt tired, maybe increased anxiety at first) but I stuck with it and it's been my staple drug throughout these years compared to the 20  I have tried. I ultimately needed to add a mood stabilizer to get further relief, but Lexapro is definitely a huge help in that. I am on 10mg and Lamictal 50mg",9,4
Lexapro,Within a week I felt an immediate change. I no longer obsess over tiny little details or let opportunities pass me by because of my anxiety. I feel like a normal person. Give it a chance!!!,10,107
Lexapro,I had severe panic attacks for 6 months! I developed derealization and was scared of everything. I felt like I was living in a nightmare. I felt relief from Lexapro immediately. I was foggy headed at first but that went away. I feel amazing after 2 months of taking it. I feel like my old self again. The only side effect is dizziness at night sometimes. I only take 5 mg.,10,127
Lexapro,"On Lexapro 14 months now. I almost never want Xanax anymore, and I am sleeping better than I have since I was a teenager (I am 46). Two negative results: sex drive has decreased markedly, and I've had a 10% weight gain. But even with these two factors, I would never consider going back to the person I was before Lexapro.",9,91
Lexapro,It is great to read all your different experiences with Escitalopram and it gives me hope that a lot of you have been able to benefit from this. I am only on Day 3 with 10 mg  Escitalopram (1st time on AD) and I really hope this will reducere my SA and GAD after 10 years of suffering,8,50
Lexapro,"Taking Lexapro was the best decision I've ever made!! I've struggled with anxiety and depression since I was a kid. I had never taken any medications for it until I was 24. The anxiety had taken over my life, I could barely go to work and I was up for most of my nights because my mind would be going 100 miles an hour and I couldn't get my mind to stop racing. I had a lot of social anxiety. Every single little thing would seem like such a huge task or issue. I felt completely exhausted all the time, all I wanted to do was sleep. After about 4 months of being it Lexapro I can finally say I am the happiest I've ever been! I've even started college which is something I thought I would never have the courage to do.",10,264
Lexapro,"Before Lexapro I was extremely stressed out for at least a year before taking it. Everything my boyfriend would do would cause me to snap. I would snap on family members constantly as well. If they were chewing too loud, whistling, or looking at me, I would flip out and yell. No lie here...within 2 days I had noticed a day and night difference. My boyfriend absolutely adores me now. I love who I am and I can't imagine life the way it was before. This medicine was/is a miracle to me. The only side effect I had was yawning often the first two days, but that went away. I love living life now and enjoy myself. I can't express enough how much it has helped. My life has taken an absolute 180!",10,160
Lexapro,"8 years ago I had my 3rd child, a healthy baby girl, and suffered from horrible postpartum depression.  My OBGYN put me on 10 mg Lexapro and after a few more terrible days and a trip to the ER I ended up in a psychiatrist office. He added mirtazapine to help me eat and sleep and in 2 weeks I was much better.  I was able to stop the mirtazapine and took the Lexapro for a full year. I am so grateful to those 2 Dr's who helped me crawl out off a very dark hole.  A month ago I fell back in and my anxiety kicked into high gear. I was barely functioning.  After 2 weeks my psychologist put me back on 10 Mg Escitalopram.  I am entering my 3rd week and feel much better.  This medicine has been wonderful.  Prayer   medicine   talk therapy.",10,40
Lexapro,"Lexapro played a very important role in saving my life. After suffering serious anxiety and depression, while going through 6 years of therapy, and only feeling worse, I finally accepted that therapy on its own wasn't working. After a month Of using Lexapro, I noticed a significant difference in my quality of life. I liked the change the experience I had when I was first prescribed glasses when I was younger. I remember putting on glasses for the first time and thinking to myself, I had no idea this is what the world looks like! Everything was so clear and beautiful. That's what everything was like after starting Lexapro- I had no idea that it was even possible to live a life free from constant, sickening anxiety. Life now is beautiful!",0,190
Lexapro,"During a recent stretch of terrible anxiety which  crept up very slowly, I suddenly became incapacitated. I was in fear of everything and I couldn't function- AT ALL. I went to my doctor and explained the symptoms and he recommended Lexapro 10 mg. with Klonopin .5 mg. as needed. I took both medications and the Klonopin erased all the startup side effects of the Lexapro such as increased nervousness, insomnia, and poor appetite. As soon as the Lexapro kicked in, ( about three weeks) I was able to step off the Klonopin and have felt great ever since. Anxiety has been wiped out and sleep has improved. I feel 100% better. Don't give up, this medication WORKS !!",10,220
Lexapro,"I didn't realize how bad I was until I took this medicine!  I'll start back: for seven years, I was either pregnant or breastfeeding and my mood deteriorated the whole time.  A year before I took Lexapro, I was almost done nursing my youngest and started to get awful pelvic spasms.  Then, once I finished nursing, I developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  After that, anxiety attacks.  My Dr. said, We gotta put you on something so I asked for something to help calm my stomach and nerve pain in my pelvis.  I started on 5 mg, then 10 mg 2 weeks later.  It's been 4 weeks and I'm seeing an amazing difference.  Pelvic pain significantly reduced, stomach eased, and I'm happier and the shakes and nervousness have lessened.  Still have some dry mouth, so be prepared. A !",9,30
Lexapro,Best medication ever. It takes a bit to kick in but once it does ....amazing.  I am on my way to getting my life back. Don't get discouraged it works. I was in my sixth week before i felt it and my doctor increased me to 20 mg and things are going great.,10,124
Lexapro,"I waited 2 months to write this because I was convinced it wouldn't work for me. Lexapro WORKS. Stick it out before giving up. I got much worse before I got better. I started at 10 mg and am now at 20 mg. In the beginning, my anxiety and obsessive thoughts got a lot worse, and when I increased my dose it spiked up again. But it finally passed and the difference is huge. I feel like me again, but me without crippling anxiety and constant obsessive thoughts. My periods do make it worse. My side effects of dry mouth, constipation, sleeplessness, heavy sweating all are gone now. And NO sexual issues for me. Oh, and don't be scared of the generic - that's what I take. Hang in there and give it time!",9,282
Lexapro,"I've been on and off Lexapro for 6 years. I got off it twice thinking I was completely fine and then a year later (both times getting off) my anxiety came back tenfold. I am back on Lexapro now and happier than ever. Many people are scared of being on medicine or asking for help but we are all made differently and some of us need medicines to live a fuller, more amazing life. Lexapro has enabled me to accomplish things I didn't see possible and allowed me to relax and enjoy life more! Everyone has their own definition as anxiety but to me if your anxiety is interfering with your every day life then try everything you can to remediate it. I have tried yoga, vitamins/ other homeopathic remedies and as much as I wished they worked, they didn't.",10,109
Lexapro,"My Anxiety symptoms before Lexapro I was always paranoid of people judging me and just wasn't myself because I always felt panicked.  I would socially isolate myself from friends and family, which then drove me into depression.  My anxiety inhibited myself from learning and grasping new knowledge because I was too anxious to even learn.  Even doing the smallest tasks (paying bills) would cause an overwhelming amount of anxiety. Now (after 4 weeks on 10 mg) - I'm mellow, feel confident. Someone I just met pegged me as an intellect! God knows how long anxiety has made me doubt my intelligence.  I'm able to do tasks easier, which has reduced my procrastination.  It hasn't completely reduced my depression, but Im thinking of trying 20 mg.",10,147
Lexapro,"Before taking Lexapro I would be very uncomfortable around  people and I would become depressed because I continued to deal with mild obsessive compulsive disorder.  My job is also very stressful as I am a manager at an entertainment business and would obsess over my job so I would not miss any details.  I had no time for life outside of work because I would obsess over my job and worse case scenario.  I am a 26 year old and when I was younger, around 17,  doctors would treat me with all types of depressive medications.  With negative outcomes, I decided young that I would not take any more medications and toughen it out.   NOW with events leading up to me taking Lexapro, I am a new person and I don't worry about little things any more.  The OCD is GONE!",10,76
Lexapro,"Before I took this medication, I had severe social anxiety. I would often stay silent because of hurting someone's feelings or I was afraid of embarassment. I constantly worried about what people thought of me. It was ruining my life. My doctor started me on Paxil but I couldnt take the physical symptoms. When I started taking Lexapro it felt like a huge weight was taken off of my shoulders. I could be myself again! I usually take it at night because it makes me a little drowsy.   Months later, I got a job working for a school near me as a bus monitor. I ride the preschool and high school buses to maintain safety and prevent bullying. Without Lexapro, I DEFINITELY would have not been able to be in that position before.",10,174
Lexapro,"I began feeling very anxious and getting anxiety attacks almost every morning. This went on for months and finally I told my doctor. She gave me a low dose of Xanax and it helped a bit but once it wore off, I had to take more since my anxiety returned. I asked my doctor to put me on Lexapro and I swear, it started to work almost immediately! I have been on it two weeks now and I've only had one minor anxiety attack, and every day I'm feeling a little better. I'm already feeling much calmer and more peaceful and I only take 5mg at night. My sleep is better too! The only side effects were nausea, and diarrhea (which are subsiding) and weight loss (which I don't mind). I'm feeling so much more hopeful now, and I had almost lost hope.",9,104
Lexapro,"My experience thus far on this mediicne is absolutely life changing. I have never taken any form of medication in my life bar antibiotics on a couple of occasions, however when anxiety hit me out of nowhere I thought I was losing my mind. I could not think or function. I didn't have the strength to stomach food and was afraid all the time. I could not work and thought that living was becoming impossible. As a result of this I became depressed and the vicious cycle continued. I thought I would never escape this feeling.  It all became too much for me after about a month and I went to my doctor a blithering mess. He prescribed me 10mg Lexapro and I regained my life. 14 days later I am back to normal and happy smiling. Get your life back.",10,174
Lexapro,"I've had anxiety and panic attacks for many years.  I've tried diet and exercise,meditiation, herbs, and when I finally realized how many things I was missing out on with my family and friends I knew I needed to try medicine.  First I tried Buspar which offered no help and made me really dizzy. Next was Lexapro.       The first couple of days on Lexapro i noticed nothing. By day 4 I was really tired and had a headache. Day 5-6 was the same and I was very anxious and couldn't sleep.  By this point i am so tired I have to sleep late, sleep at lunch and go to bed early.  On day 8-10 my ears rang and I almost gave up. On day 11 I FINALLY started to feel better.  Waiting for 4 weeks to see full benefits, but the side effects DO go away.",7,81
Lexapro,"Lexapro saved my life. I was locked into worry, self-recrimination, and rumination.  I couldn't let go of the past and see myself in a good light.  Within a couple of days the anxiety lifted and I could finally SLEEP! I've been taking it now for 6 weeks.  In that time, I got a volunteer job that I love and I'm so upbeat. I'm grateful for this site because I read others' experiences which led me to ask my psychiatrist for Lexapro.  Thanks to the posts about taking only the brand name Lexapro (my psychiatrist concurs).  It's difficult taking medicines because with emotional/mental problems we feel out of control and taking a medicine that doesn't work makes us feel more out of control. It's worth trying until you find what works.  Don't give up.",10,136
Lexapro,Lexapro literally saved my life.  I had such bad anxiety before taking this medicine.,10,117
Lexapro,"Male, 50, about 1 yr ago experienced sudden onset of debilitating generalized anxiety disorder.  Suffered 3 months trying benzodiazepines, Buspar, Wellbutrin and Lexapro 10 mg.  Settled on Lexapro 20 mg.  100% symptom-free in about 1 month.  After 1 year, tapered off about a month ago.  ZERO negative side effects from tapering and 100% recovery.  I'm not one to suggest a miracle but this is about as close as it gets.",10,205
Lexapro,"Been on Lexapro for quite a few years now. It helped me a great deal, my anxiety was out of control. I now lead a pretty normal life now. I would have been sent to the loony bin if it wasn't for Lexapro.",10,124
Lexapro,"I started Lexapro less than 3 weeks ago and I absolutely love it. I was extremely nauseous and threw up several time just hours after taking it my first week, so I started taking it an hour before bed (also makes me very drowsy so it helps me fall asleep). I am no longer feeling sick whatsoever. I have lost more than 10 pounds and have gained TONS of self-confidence. I highly recommend trying Lexapro.",9,135
Lexapro,"Starting Lexapro was tough.  Shivering with stomach cramps, for a week I constantly felt like I had taken some bad, terribly impure Ecstasy. Once I became acclimated to the drug, my postpartum anxiety disappeared; however, I was incredibly fatigued during the day. I also stopped caring about most things in general.  My house wasn't as clean and creative endeavors came to a halt.  My short term memory declined.  It felt like my brain was muffled. I experienced lucid, unnerving dreams/nightmares most nights while taking Lexapro. I gained 8 pounds in the 8 months I took it, all in my middle.  It took a long time to get this off afterward. Getting off Lexapro was also tough, with back pain, insomnia, and 10 days of brain zaps.",4,57
Lexapro,"I was very anti-medication. I think people with anxiety often have a phobia of medication. This is too bad, because it can be a total life saver. After a year of anxiety and agoraphobia with hypochondria, I relented and tried the Lexapro. I had not been able to leave the house which was debilitating. I had very few side effects with the meds-maybe minor headaches. After 2 weeks I was able to travel. After 6 weeks I was able to go back to work. It has been two months and I continue to do better. I still need to work on some of the phobic situations, but have not had a panic attack in 2 months. It is a miracle medicine. I do hope I don't need to be on it forever, but for now I am so very happy I took the plunge.",10,138
Lexapro,"I have experienced horrible panic attacks and anxiety my whole life but went unnoticed until a major breakdown this summer. I was unable to sleep, had panic attacks at work and could barely function. I had thoughts of doom and my emotions were out of control. The anxiety lead to depression and it felt like my life was spinning out of control.  I have since sought help and am doing great on 10mg of Lexapro and 1 mg Klonpin for anxiety. My moods are also better, worrysome thoughts are under control.  I highly recommend this medication to anyone suffering from anxiety and depression.",10,133
Lexapro,"After trying to deal with my anxiety without taking medication for the past 2 yrs I finally gave in and asked my doctor for a recommendation. She prescribed me Lexapro the 1st 2 days were a little scary (especially after reading the 20 million positive and negative reviews) I felt more anxious and on edge than ever but my search results said that would happen and my doctor had told me I would get worse before I started feeling better so I figured it was normal. After the first 2 days I got the over anxious feeling, so I started focusing on watching out for any other side effects and just getting used to it. The constant yawning the 1st few weeks was just annoying but working out helped a bit. 1 month later and things are going better.",10,83
Lexapro,"I started Lexapro for major anxiety and moderate depression. I'm on 6 weeks and finally feeling better. I am more energized and motivated than ever. Because of my bad anxiety, I went from 5mg, to 10mg, and then to 20mg. It's been a long battle but I am feeling hopeful again and want to do things! The anxiety is still barely there. The depression is gone! I can't wait until I see the full effects at around 2 months.",8,81
Lexapro,"Lexapro is a lifesaver. Do not worry about the negative reviews, and keep in mind that the majority of them have been written by people who got off after days or a few weeks. Anxiety got a lot worse in the beginning. When it does, you get scared. Scared that the pills won't work. Scared that it will be like this for ever. But it DOES get better. For me, it really took a long time. I felt a very gradual improvement every week, and after about 3 months my anxiety was practically gone. I feel like a new person - it is amazing that a pill is able to do this. And for any emetophobics reading this: It helps against that fear as well. I didn't experience any nausea, but kept Reglan just in case. Sex drive lower, but able to orgasm. Life is good.",10,193
Lexapro,"I've found a lot of these posts quite encouraging.  I started taking Lexapro 6 to 8 years ago - 20mg and definitely felt it was a miracle for that entire 6 to 8 years.  I was really stressed and couldn't concentrate at work.  Sure, I still had stresses, but they didn't seem to be unmanageable. I was probably doing a little 'too' fine because I tried to get off of it about 3 months ago because I want to see if I could actually go without medicines.  BIG MISTAKE!!  A couple of life stressers recently popped up and sent my anxiety into overdrive.  I immediately called my Dr. to get my prescription refilled.  Currently on day 4 and battling anxiety and insomnia, but hopeful that the magic will return soon! I think I'm a lifer on this medicine!",10,95
Lexapro,"There are a lot of negative reviews about this medicine and it's side effects, and that makes a lot of people beginning the medicine, including myself, freak out. The people having a positive experience with Lexapro are out living life. Don't be discouraged. For me, Lexapro started working in the second week, but would work on and off for the first month. I started at 5mg and slowly went up to 15. I'm on week 5 and it hasn't done much for my anxiety (yet) but it has helped my moods tremendously. For the first month I had muscle aches and headaches, and I was really tired and unmotivated. That went away in week 4 and I'm feeling better than I have felt in two years.",8,73
Lexapro,"Life changing medicine for panic disorder and anxiety.  Zero side effects save for slight insomnia on days 1-3 and a bit of muscle weirdness and stomach pain (similar to ibuprofen) in week 1.  Most days I am a normal person now.  Still supplement with clonazepam for trigger situations on occasion, but most of the time I can focus on life without panic distracting me.",9,70
Lexapro,"Lexapro is amazing. I was blind sided by a panic attack when I was 22. This panic lead to being anxious which lead to obsessive thoughts about feeling poorly, ultimately causing male depression (not sad but lack of lust for life). It was a viscous cycle, I'd obsess over being anxious and this caused me to be more anxious. I had so a dozen symptoms ranging from dizziness to blurry vision to stomach discomfort. It just made no sense to me how all this was related. Long story short, started Lexapro, first 2 weeks made everything worse that just as quickly as it can't the anxiety and obsessive thoughts were gone. Wow up one day and my mind went racing! Would recommend and encourage people not to get discouraged if it doesn't work immediately.",10,114
Lexapro,"Been taking Lexapro 10mg for 4 weeks now. It started to help a little after just 2 days. Now I have very few guilt feelings, nearly no depression, no suicidal thoughts, no obsessing over negative things. Not too much help with social anxiety, but does help anxiety around angry people.  Unfortunately, during PMS, it barely helps me, but once that is passed, I'm okay again. Makes sleep WONDERFUL and easy. Side effects-sleepy off and on during the day, mild, treatable, headaches the first few days.",9,68
Lexapro,"I finally feel more mentally stable! I've been on this for a week and a half and I already noticed a HUGE difference like ...I'm in serious shock. This is like a miracle. I've been diagnosed with depression, and every type of anxiety. I am now more talkative, I have way more patience &amp; I just feel so happy. Like I feel normal. And I had little to no side effects. I did 5mg for a week then upped to 10mg three days ago and since I started all I felt was more tired but that went away in the first 3 days. The first day though I took a nap after I took it and I lost my appetite for the night and I felt a bit shaky for 2 secs but after that everything was normal.",10,117
Lexapro,I have had anxiety all my life and I am now 63 years old. About 3 years ago my life spun out of control with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder and I was not functional as a human being. I tried Buspar to start and it did nothing to help me then I tried Zoloft and I could not handle the side effects. Finally I got on brand name Lexapro which started helping me. Once I leveled off at 40 mg per day I resumed being my normal self. About a month ago I switched to generic escitalopram and now I am noticing I am not as happy and I am having anxiety symptoms again. I am going back to brand name immediately. I don't care what anyone says brand is better than generic and there is a difference.,9,94
Lexapro,"I've been taking escitalopram for more than a month at 10mg daily for my anxiety disorder. Last 2 years ago I took this for more 2 months at the same dose. Last Feb I had observed that my anxiety was back again so I started to take last month. Thanks to God I feel better again now after 1 week, although there is little anxiety but not so compared before.",10,40
Lexapro,"Amazing! After only 2 weeks on Lexapro my life has changed dramatically I had deep depression &amp; severe anxiety! I only felt sick for 2 days &amp; everything changed I feel great no more racing thoughts &amp; finally have energy back. I've been into a shopping plaza, can drive anywhere &amp; most importantly can go anywhere without a fear something bad will happen. The only down fall it has for me is I now have NO sex drive, but if that's the worst I have to deal with I definitely think I'm winning.",10,139
Lexapro,"All my life I've suffered from depression. Within the last year, severe anxiety came out of nowhere and I'd have about 2 or three bad attacks per month, on top of the multiple small attacks I'd get daily. ESPECIALLY in social settings. But even alone. I completely withdrew myself from my classes and my social life because of this.   I started going to church. Meditating, running, praying, dieting, yoga, and trying to practice mindfulness.The failed attempts worsened my depression.  I wanted the anxiety to stop so bad that I frequently considered suicide.  Its been less than a day taking Lexapro but I'm so hopeful. Everything that felt like such a huge deal just hours ago are so minimal now.",8,91
Lexapro,"Suffering from daily and day-long anxiety and occasional panic attacks, Lexapro 10mg definitely made a difference within less than a month.  I wasn't as anxious or worrisome all the time and my patience was much better. Because it's also for depression, I also found a change in my mood for the best.  Unfortunately, after a few months on it, I plateaued, so I guess.  I've tried weaning myself off very slowly in a span of 3 months at least 3 times.  Each time, I get the brain zaps, which can be a bit cool but gets annoying.  After a few days of that comes the manic psychosis.  I get so ramped up and irritable and argumentative...it goes away within 24 hrs of taking a dose.  SO here I am, still taking it.",8,66
Lexapro,"I had taken Buspar after my initial diagnosis and it had actually made it far worse. After switching to Lexapro, I can make it whole chunks of time (mostly three to four weeks) without having panic attacks. All the women and most men in my family suffer from generalized anxiety disorder and we're all on Lexapro with various dosages. My sister is in treatment for Hepatitis and those medications cause her anxiety and depression to worsen but Lexapro has helped. I also get strange problems with my vision and my ability to think clearly and problem solve when I'm in withdrawal from it (Our pharmacy sometimes screws up and I have a three day period of in refills).",8,35
Lexapro,I take Lexapro 10mg in the morning and trazodone 25-50 mg as needed for sleep. This combination works really well and has helped turn my life around with my depression and anxiety.,10,67
Lexapro,"250lbs, 6'2, male.. Am taking 5mg Lexapro for about a week, and either it is this or the Lamictal (100mg), but I've experienced reduced anxiety, I was wondering if it just reduces the Anxiety or also reduces the symptoms because I still get pounding  and increased heart beat, my blood pressure is usually 20 points high, I take Lisinopril and used to get 120/80 , now I get 140/80 with the lisinopril, Lexapro and Lamictal. Other things I've heard is if you go off Lamictal cold turkey, you'll get seizures. I'm staying on 5mg, I figure if the dose is upped, it overloads the system and is maybe what leads to tolerance, so I'm staying with a small dose until I feel ready to up it.",10,25
Lexapro,"I've been on Lexapro for two months now. The first 4 weeks I had very minor side effects. Dry mouth, dilated pupils, etc. VERY minor and only lasted 2 days each. Two months later I can tell you this medication is amazing. I suffered from very periodic anxiety which turned into panic attacks on some occasions. It was always in the back of my mind as to if or when it was going to happen. That's no way to live. I feel focused with clear thought now. I still laugh and feel every emotion...I just don't worry about things like I used to before Lexapro. I'm happier and have a more positive outlook on difficult situations in my life now. I find myself being much more social now too. Miracle medication for sure!",10,231
Lexapro,"I've been taking Lexapro for a week now to help me keep mellow like jello. I'm not taking anything else. I work 3rd shift. So my nights are days. And days are nights. This makes makes me extremely sleepy by the end of the week. I have only been on it for a week. This last Friday after I got off work. I fell asleep in recliner from 8:00am to 1:00pm got up ate a bite. Went to bed. I woke up to go to the bathroom a few times. But didn't get out of bed till 11:00pm Saturday. I have not left my bedroom, or ate anything. I don't feel like doing anything or going anywhere. I will be calling my doctor Monday and talking to him about how it makes me feel.",6,51
Lexapro,I've been taking Lexapro for about 2 months now.  I have suffered from social anxiety all of my life and finally went to the doctor to get help.  It was the best thing I ever did.  I now can function and feel normal.  I didn't have any bad side effects from the medicine and have been very pleased with the results.  My day to day life is not filled with me avoiding many situations and I now feel normal.  I never expected this medication to work.  My only regret is I didn't get help sooner.,9,194
Lexapro,"I used to be on 200mg of sertraline but after 12 years on this medicine I started having severe problems with anxiety after a good friend's death, this eventually led to a near breakdown 3 years later when my anxiety became so bad I could barely function.  My Dr suggested I switch to escitalopram.  I was terrified of making this switch &amp; put it off for weeks but eventually decided to 'take the plunge'. 4 days later and my anxiety levels are already reducing HUGELY! I wish I'd taken this sooner &amp; can't believe how easy the switch was. I literally stopped taking my 200mg of sertraline one day and started taking 20mg of escitalopram the next. This stuff's a life saver!",10,96
Lexapro,"I love Lexapro! It helps me stop drinking, lose weight and I have way less anxiety now. For all those people that have sexual dysfunction, try taking it at night right before bed, after sex. I have no problems in that area now!",10,136
Lexapro,Good but gave me runs and gas.,9,39
Lexapro,I suffer from hypochondria and panic disorder. I was so afraid to take medication. After 2 years I finally took Cipralex. It has made my anxiety a lot more tolerable. I've had a few major panic attacks but overall good experience. I've been on 20mg for 2 years.,9,32
Lexapro,"I am a 26 year old who has had anxiety since I was a child. I've gone through rough spots on and off throughout my life where I would feel extremely anxious and nauseous all of the time. I finally decided to do something about it when I started experiencing panic attacks on top of it all. Lexapro along with seeing a psychologist saved my life. I went into this knowing there is no magic pill out there - I still have good and bad days like everyone, but NOTHING like how bad I felt before. When I initially began taking the medicine, it made my anxiety worse - I told my doctor and he adjusted the dosage to a smaller amount. I felt tremendously better in just about a week, and have continued to feel better and better.",10,101
Lexapro,"I am a 30 year old female who has suffered from depression and anxiety my entire life and it got worse after I had my daughter.  Two years after she was born, I couldnt take it anymore and I had to get help.  I talked to my doctor and was put on Lexapro, 10 mg.  I hated it at first.  I was dizzy and swimmy feeling, couldnt sleep, couldnt eat, felt out of it, couldn't care less about things that were going on.  This only lasted about a week!  Then, I could gradually feel myself getting used to it.  My next appt, my dosage was upped to 20 mg (he started me on 10 because he wanted to ease me into it knowing I was a mom and worked full time; i still needed to function).  Let me just say that Lexapro SAVED MY LIFE!!  I love it and swear by it!",10,194
Lexapro,Life saver for my anxiety,9,60
Lexapro,Worked wonders for stabilising my mood - and my ability to leave the house! Been taking it for about two years now. only thing I find is it starts to 'wear off' after a few months. My doctor has me come off them for a month and then go back on when this happens and I find this much more effective than upping the dose.  Main side effect for me has been insomnia. A small price to pay for the huge positive impact Lexapro has made on my life.,10,66
Lexapro,"I got sick from it, diarrhea. I started having ear trouble and started hallucinating.",3,32
Lexapro,I have been on 10 mg of Lexapro for about 6 years.  I am so thankful for this medication.  I am a crying weepy mess without it!,10,89
Lexapro,"I've been taking Lexapro for 2 months now for depression and panic attacks, which seem to come from nowhere (and I've never truly understood how scary a panic attack could be until that moment). It has helped me tremendously! Suddenly this last week the side effects which had seemed to taper, have returned. I have the addition of a headache (which I did not have in the beginning) and irritability. I'm also noticeably more tired than I was before. I am now taking the Lexapro in the evening instead of in the morning to help with sleep - but am curious if it is normal to have the side effects go in waves? It seemed as if they were mostly gone except for the lethargy, now they are increasing.",9,53
Lexapro,"If you're suffering, you need to fix you! This medication is the most important thing to ever happen in my life. I went from a nervous, neurotic, obsessional wreck, to calm, cool and in-control dude - and I only take 5-10 mg (I'm 6' 4). Over the last seven years, I've taken it on average 1-2 months out of the year - only when needed and never more than 6-8 weeks. I prefer not to be on anything, but when my health and business decline because of my mood, I immediately break the safety glass and reach for the Lexapro. And if for some reason Lexapro doesn't work for you, work with your doctor to find the right medicine so you can feel better. (I've tried 6 different medicines, we all have different chemistries - never give up.",10,197
Lexapro,I was prescribed Lexapro about a month ago. Initially I was sleepy all the time but I took it at night and now the only side effect is difficulty reaching an orgasm. I love this medicine! I was having several panic attacks a day and since being on 20mg/night I'm back to myself! I'm going to continue. It's like my own Happy Pill.,10,82
Lexapro,"I have had some difficulty with anxiety and depression. I started taking Zoloft in January after a family crisis triggered my anxiety. I was on Zoloft for 8 months, but it stopped working and was making my jaw tense and causing me to grind my teeth.  My doctor switched me to Lexapro, and I started at 5mg.  I stayed on the 5 mg until my follow-up appointment. The 5 mg starter dosage was not very effective for me. This is my 3rd day on 10 mg of Lexapro. I feel like my old self. I don't shovel food into my face or feel bloated like I did with the Zoloft. I have my old sense of humor back. So far, I have not experienced any sexual side effects, but I noticed that Lexapro is causing a small amount of facial acne. Thumps UP!",10,68
Lexapro,"I have been taking Lexapro for approx. three months, 10 mg/day. It has helped a great deal to reduce my anxiety and depression. I still have good days and not so good, but rarely fall back to where I was (sounds like many people on this have experience the same). I agree it has some side effects, but when you consider the benefit, its well worth it.",8,50
Lexapro,"I was on Lexapro 10mg and Abilify 10 mg for about 5 months, and overall it helped with my anxiety. I didn't feel as stressed at work and school, but it kind of made me a zombie. I haven't cried in 5 months, and I hardly feel any emotions. Which I guess is good for people suffering from depression. It completely killed my sex drive so I went to my doctor the other day and switched prescriptions. Currently withdrawing from this medication and it sucks. Getting light-headed and dizzy and vomited a lot the other day.",7,34
Lexapro,"Definitely improving my life. I'm less stressed at work and life with the kids is easier.  Some social settings (crowds) still bothersome, but I'm getting there. One of the pages I read warned about caffeine intake, they weren't kidding. I cut out caffeine and it lessened my mood swings.  Please read about interactions with other medicines when you start something new, it makes a difference!",7,50
Lexapro,"Not every medicine is for everyone, but as one who has tried most of the major pharmaceuticals for major depression, panic attacks, severe anxiety and anxiety related bouts of obsessive compulsive disorder, I can tell you Lexapro is the only medicine that I've been able to stay on and be effective for my mental well-being...it is the only one I've had no side effects with. Other SSRI's have either: made me more anxious and/or depressed, dry mouth, BAD weight gain, or extreme fatigue making me into a walking zombie during the day. I've been on Lexapro 6 years now taking from 20 to 30 milligrams each day. During the months with the most sunshine, 20mg is effective. During months of winter, I have to bump it up by 10 mg's. I supplement with 4000 to 6000 IU's of D3 daily",10,75
Lexapro,"It helps with anxiety but actually causes depression for me. Plus, I've gained weight, even when on a starvation type diet. I'm slowing weening myself off, down to 2.5 mg a day, next  week I'm stopping completely.  I just want to have a clear head, instead of feeling like a zombie.",7,37
Lexapro,"I have been on Lexapro for three and a half years- it has completely changed my life, my moods, my behavior and my reactions to life for the better. I noticed an improvement within. 24 hours after starting Lexapro.",10,90
Lexapro,"I've been on Lexapro for under three weeks now and it's been pretty great so far. I suffer from severe general and social anxiety and also depression.  I started on 10mg for the first four days, then upped to 20mg on the fifth day.  I noticed slight results after day four and to this day the over thinking and gut wrenching anxiety has been lessened. I have no depression anymore and it's close to impossible to care about stressful situations. I'm well aware it can take up to two months for Lexapro to fully take effect, however I feel the positive benefits already. Definitely something worth a try! Especially if you have anxiety and depression that is out of control.  Besides the side effects, which are slowly fading away, Lexapro is great",8,104
Lexapro,"I never comment on these this but I feel this website sharing positive experiences helped me a lot. I had my first panic attack two months ago after a night out. Weeks of having 3-4 panic attacks a day and massive levels of anxiety followed. I tried to carry on with life as normal going to work, etc. and started CBT, which helped me establish it had started due to increased stress from work. I struggled to get on trains, tubes, eating in restaurant's, shopping...pretty much every day to day task. When I was put onto Cipralex and for the first four weeks I had high levels on anxiety, headaches, disassociation, tight chest, chest pains. Now on week 5 on Lexapro I am feeling much better and can do everything I did before with only low levels of anxiety.",10,96
Lexapro,(escitalopram),9,16
Lexapro,"When I first started this on 10mg, I had bad sides. Insomnia, crawling skin, heart palpitations and shallow breathing. I think a lot of it was in my head and from reading too much about side effects. My doctor wanted me to go back on Celexa but I had already been on Lexapro 3.5 weeks so I asked my doc if I could stick with it. He bumped my dose up to 15mg and its now been 2 weeks on 15 mg and it has helped ALOT with my anxiety and panic attacks. I can now actually function at work. Give it a chance. I'm no doctor but for me it took over 4 weeks. It worked! Hang in there.",9,71
Lexapro,About a 1 yr ago I had a very bad allergic reaction to shellfish were I thought I would die. I was with my husband &amp; my 5 yr old son in a restaurant when it happened. They rushed me to the hospital and later that day I went home just to come back 5 more times not knowing that they were panic attacks and a lot of anxiety. They gave me 1 mg of Ativan and I felt normal soon. I saw a Psychologist and a psychiatrist too and they told me I also suffer from phobia and its sad because I don't know what to do.,10,22
Lexapro,"So far have been on Lexapro for 4 weeks (not counting the first week of weaning off Remeron and onto Lexapro).  Generally, I think I feel better as a whole, but know I have to give it more time.  Unfortunately, this has NOT helped the anxiety I experience every single morning which makes me cry, and have actually had to take more Ativan than prescribed to stop the trembling inside.  Will be talking to my doctor soon because something's got to give.  I don't want to try anything else after 4 weeks and go through new side-effects, and most of the comments on here are very favorable if you stick it out.  Guess I'm going to try to stick it out for another couple weeks.  I wish people could comment on these comments instead of in the Questions and Answers forum.",7,31
Lexapro,"Lexapro helped me in many ways back in 2009. I suffered with anxiety for awhile before I sought professional help. After many exhausting trips to urgent cares and emergency rooms, it was time to address my anxiety head on. After a trip to an urgent care in San Diego, a doctor prescribed me 10 0.25mg of Xanax. He said I should try it out to help ease my anxiety. Xanax worked wonders but I knew that it wasn't safe for long term use. I eventually got a new prescription from my primary for a 30 day supply of 0.25mg of Xanax. I used it very sparingly and it took almost three months to finish the 30 day supply. My anxiety was still horrible and I was becoming too reliant on Xanax. I needed help fast! That's when Lexapro changed my life.",8,62
Lexapro,Lexapro has finally provided stability to my life after about 6 months. I still have a long way to go and alot to do before I feel Recovered but the medication has definitely helped with my anxiety.,7,45
Lexapro,I've been on it for 5 years and my life is a lot different then it would have been without it!,9,55
Lexapro,"Lexapro has changed my life! I no longer have anxiety attacks, and I have control over my emotions. I wish I had started taking it years ago!",10,76
Lexapro,"About a year ago I lost 8 pounds in 1 week, two pounds more the next week. I couldn't sleep and constantly felt nauseous. My doctor ran every test under the sun and came back with only one conclusion:  panic attacks and severe anxiety. After I got past my initial thoughts of thinking he must be a total idiot, I asked for Lexapro.  I did 5 mg the first week, moving up to 10 the week after.  As my MD warned, the anxiety initially increases, so keep the Xanax handy. Two weeks into it I started having longer and longer periods of normalcy. Then, on week three it's like it suddenly stopped and sent me into a tailspin right back to where I started from. My Pscyh told me to go to 20mg because I didn't have quite enough. Worked like a charm!",10,53
Lexapro,"I have been suffering from anxiety for about 1.5 years. I am a big believer in natural medicine and psychotherapy. I have tried EVERYTHING . I exercise daily, I eat healthy, I take vitamins I tried meditation, vitamins -You name it. The anxiety started when I began dieting for a body building competition I lost about 10kilos and got down to a small amount of body fat. At this stage my periods stopped and I stopped producing estrogen and progesterone. I always told my mum and close friends it just felt like something inside me was 'missing'. I've been on Lexapro for 2 days and everything has changed. I can't BELIEVE it and I cannot believe I've wasted 1.5 years feeling that bad. You don't realize how bad it is until you feel relief.",9,71
Lexapro,"Lexapro saved my life pure and simple. I was 42 years old and worked many years in the financial industry. One night before I went to bed right after X-mas, I had a severe panic attack and for three months I suffered unbelievably. I tried dieting, meditation, vitamins, exercise, you name it. Nothing worked. I first tried Zoloft but the side effects were awful. Next I tried Lexapro. Side effects were bad for 2 weeks and then after a month, anxiety reduced by 80%. Still have some but 100% better than before. Another key is to meditate, eat right, exercise and connect spiritually. Lexapro for the brain and meditation for the soul!",10,141
Lexapro,"I've suffered with extreme anxiety and moods swings daily, fatigue and depression and I can tell you two weeks on Lexapro and the difference is like night and day. The anxiety improved about 2 days in and almost all sides are gone on the 8th day. The first week is the worst with tiredness and increased anxiety and moodiness and nausea but the benefits are worth it completely, I can now tolerate stress so much better. Tips: Always take it after breakfast and it prevents nausea. No problem with sleep so far for me.",9,69
Lexapro,"This medicine is great for anxiety, but within first month noticed weight gain and has increased significantly over past 10 years, cannot seem to lose weight only lost 5 pounds on extreme diet/exercise.",10,24
Lexapro,It saved my life! I can't say enough good about this medication. It ceased the panic attacks in a few days. I highly recommend this medication.,10,69
Lexapro,"Lexapro is a double edged sword for me. I can finally live, now that I have it, free of anxiety. However, I can no longer live without it. I have tried numerous times to wean, all to no avail. So far after about 6 years of use, my labworks are still all fine and normal. Hopefully this will never change.",9,36
Lexapro,"My doctor prescribed 10mg Lexapro for severe anxiety about 5months ago.  The first 4 weeks were really rough as the side effects almost caused me to discontinue the medicine. By the 4th week, I had insomnia.  I couldn't sleep for several days.  I felt like I was on speed.  So, I cut the pill in half and the next day I felt a difference.  I've been on 5mg for the last 4 months. And, I must say that it has changed my life for the better.  I no longer have those negative thoughts or bouts of anxiety. Its amazing.  The only side effects that continue are: clenching of the jaw and weight gain due to an increase in appetite. If you take Lexapro, give it 4 to 5 weeks to work before giving up. Best of luck.",9,78
Lexapro,"I suffered from anxiety disorder for 5 years without knowing what it was and after seeing numerous doctors and undergoing numerous medical tests and scans, it all came to naught. The symptoms were very vague and debilitating such as overall weakness, trembling, dizziness and even the simplest chore of lifting a pen results in strange feelings in the body.  Finally a doc gave me Lexapro 10mg and my life was saved! Since then I have taken Lexapro (6mths) and stopped and it has relapsed twice and the longest time I survived without Lexapro was 1.5 yrs. Now I believe I have anxiety disorder and need help and Lexapro really helps.",10,47
Lexapro,"Being in the army the stress level is always there day and night. Then one day bam hit me like a bullet, got real dizzy, light-headed, heart racing. In reality it was an anxiety attack. Out of all the stuff I've been through this is the one that scared me. After, I ran to the docs at the hospital they gave me Lexapro. Been on it for two months now and I feel fantastic. Still a little tight in the chest and small heart beat skips but still on track and loving it.",8,48
Lexapro,"I took Lexapro for 14 months, on 10mg for 12 and then 5mg for two. The month after I came off it was hell; anxiety returned. I was prescribed it after a severe panic attack where I became severely overwhelmed by life effects and I wasn't responding to talk therapy so it was felt by my doctors that the depression was more clinical and needed a chemical to lift me out of it. Lexapro brought to the fore my issues with alcohol as it mixes really badly with alcohol so it made me finally curb my drinking. Lexapro made me forgetful and unable to remember the word I was looking for mid-sentence or sometimes I'd say weird things which had never happened before. Overall it helped me make the positive changes I needed to get better so it did work.",9,26
Lexapro,"First, the positive. I've suffered from anxiety my entire life. This medication helped tremendously in that it was under control while I was on it. If you suffer from anxiety, you know how wonderful this can be. The negative. I gained 20 pounds quickly that I couldn't get rid of. I decided to get off of the medication because I was trying to get pregnant. The withdrawals were really bad. I had brain zaps non-stop, couldn't stand up straight because of dizziness and extreme confusion. Now, keep in mind I tapered myself slowly off this medication, per doctor's orders. It took 5 months before I wasn't experiencing these withdrawal symptoms. Horrific.",3,31
Lexapro,It worked but was just far too expensive.,9,12
Lexapro,"After dealing with generalized anxiety for most of my life, I suddenly began to have severe panic attacks. After 2 years of suffering in silence, I addressed this problem &amp; my general doctor gave me Lexapro and I began with 5mg daily. The side effects included drowsiness and frequent yawning. BUT, finally after 2 - 3 weeks I felt like a %u201Cnormal human%u201D again and still suffer from absolutely NO side effects. After 2  months of taking this medication (I have stayed on 5mg/daily), I am back to my productive and excited self. I have been able to do almost everything again and have not suffered from any panic attacks since I began the medication! STAY STRONG and HOPEFUL!",10,80
Lexapro,"I am a mom to two sweet, high energy toddlers that challenge me every minute of the day. I did start feeling on the edge and extremely stressed with my older son. Now I have been on Lexapro for almost two months and so far I like it- feel more patient and calmer, but not a Zombie. I was very scared to gain more weight on top of my remaining pregnancy weight, but actually I started losing weight since my appetite decreased. I hope it continues. I am on 10mg. The side effect- super low libido and possibly feeling a bit more tired. If that's all I am going to experience, I will stick to it for for another 5-6 months. Overall it is way better than Celexa or Zoloft for me. Good luck!",8,44
Lexapro,Phenomenal. No impact on sex drive in fact it has improved! Before Lexapro I tried Zoloft and Lovan with no success at all.,10,36
Lexapro,"I had mild anxiety and was having a difficult time controlling it. I felt overwhelmed and out of control, although I looked fine on the outside. I was prescribed Xanax for panic attacks, but was having to lean on it too much to curb my anxiety so my doctor put me on Lexapro. It's fabulous--my Xanax is practically untouched since the Lexapro kicked in. It took about three months, but then I looked back and realized I hadn't been anxious in months. I feel like the 'old me'. Side effects - had jaw clenching the first few weeks, which was really weird. But it went away. Now the only thing is if I forget to take it, I'm a mess! I feel very confused and the world doesn't feel real to me. Take it at the same time each day and always have some on you.",10,44
Lexapro,"Hey Everyone! I am going to try and make my story short. I am 26 years old and did not know what anxiety or an anxiety attack was until I turned 25.  I was driving to lunch one day and for no reason at all it hit me. I felt as if I wasn't in control of my own body. I felt like I was going to pass out at the wheel, my heart began to race and my arms and legs went numb. I drove myself straight to the ER. The doc told me it was an anxiety attack. After that first attack I could not leave my house for two weeks in fear that I would pass out or lose control. I was then put on Lexapro, the first two weeks I felt the side affects..AFTER THAT A true BLESSING!! NO ANXIETY OR ATTACKS IN 2 WEEKS! I FEEL LIKE ME AGAIN!",10,75
Lexapro,"My experience with Lexapro has been a positive one.  I've been on it after my social anxiety became intolerable and I'd hit the lowest low of my life -- had a few anxiety attacks and was doing horrible at work.  I wasn't able to keep anything straight, was disorganized, forgetful, anxious, irresponsible, irritable. I felt high anxiety in making simple decisions, writing, communicating, asserting myself, the list goes on. I started Lexapro and it took a solid 2 months for it to really start working effectively.  At that point, I became much more calm (much less anxiety), organized, together-with, and punctual (qualities I had never achieved before in my life!). I've started to eat healthier, work out, work harder, and have joined some social clubs. Success!",7,73
Lexapro,I was less upset on this medicine but much much more anxious. Tried 5mg-20mgs and different doses didn't change the anxiety levels.,2,18
Lexapro,"Lexapro has changed my life. I am now able to participate in so many activities that my anxiety wouldn't allow me to do prior. There is side effects. I don't sleep great and have crazy dreams. Dry mouth, skin and eyes is noticeably worse. Sexual feelings came back after a few months. Plus have more gas and stomach upset. But even with the side effects, my life has greatly improved.",10,45
Lexapro,"I was prescribed 10mg for 2 weeks, then up to 20mg. Originally prescribed for anxiety, I also suffered from severe depression. Within 3 weeks, I could see an improvement. My crying stopped, things were looking better!  Been on for 2/3 months now, and I feel amazing! Back to my old self. I love this medication!",10,62
Lexapro,"Not a zombie, but no sexual climaxes anymore.",10,28
Lexapro,I started 5 mg two days ago and I feel better already. No more sweaty palms or burning forehead due to high anxiety! I take it in the morning so I am able to sleep at night. I tried Zoloft and Celexa and could not take either one for more than two days! Horrific side effects for me! I pray each day gets better and better! This is my first time taking an antidepressant. I highly recommend for people with anxiety! Good luck,8,48
Lexapro,"Gained about forty pounds, became more depressed, slept all night and half the day, was always tired, getting off of it was horrible. I had headaches weird feelings like I wasn't even there, weird pains.",2,26
Lexapro,"Having started a business in a high stress field, I experienced episodes of stress and anxiety that interfered with my sleep, ability to concentrate and that began to manifest physically with chest pains, headaches, etc. The first 10 days were a nightmare.  I had a terrible spike in my anxiety and stress levels.  I considered bailing on the medication and even my business, but my wife pressed me to continue.  After 10 days I started to see an improvement.  The anxiety improved and so did my mood.  By day 14 or so I was transformed.  I completely stopped having anxious thoughts.  My entire demeanor changed.  I am now like Teflon- stress does not stick around for more than a few minutes.  This medicine was a lifesaver and my business is great.",10,110
Lexapro,"To make a long story very short, I've been struggling with perfectionism, chronic stress, anxiety, compulsive thinking, depression (Especially with nightfall)  and a fear of sleeping.  There has been a wide variety of physical manifestations such as Irritable bowel, fatigue etc..... So over all it's been a real nightmare.   The 10mg dose of Lexapro was to high for me and I had a bad reaction my first time.  I'm now on 5mg and so far it's relieved just about all my problems but my memory is clouded, takes more time to orgasm and I space out a lot.  To have the most success with feeling better you need to also make an effort to change your life.  Just keep that in mind.",8,47
Lexapro,"I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. I had crippling depression, could not sleep, eat, get out of bed or interact with anyone.  I cried uncontrollably and did not know why and if that was not enough I was having frequent panic attacks (more than one per day). My PDoc tried several meds and Lexapro 20mg is the best.  I also take Clonazapam 0.5 mg, and Wellbutrin 10mg for sexual side effects.  For the first time in my life I feel normal, having never felt this way before.  I do not like the sexual side effects so that is why my doc prescribed Welbutrin. It doesn't seem to make any difference.  I am drowsy and forgetful and lack motivation. I will ask my doc if a withdrawal from Wellbutrin or Clonazepam will will help.",9,17
Lexapro,"Completely removed my anxiety! I had panic attacks every single night prior to taking Lexapro and after the first few weeks of the Lexapro getting into my system, the anxiety has stopped altogether. I've never felt better in my life.",10,69
Lexapro,"The brain chemistry is altered and the brain takes a long time to right its self again back to as it was, in my case two years. So my advise, if you think you wish to withdraw, do it very very slowly i.e. over 4-8 months, expect withdrawal symptoms to last for months %u2013 maybe 3-4 before you feel okay, not 2-4 weeks, and most of all learn to accept yourself as you are.",1,39
Lexapro,"I was very much against taking medications but I am so glad I stepped out of my comfort zone.  Lexapro saved my life and my sanity.  I was suffering from very bad anxiety which just got worse and worse.  I didn't know what it was at first so I spent a lot of time and money going to all different doctors trying to find out.  Finally after researching anxiety and enough people telling me that is what it was I gave in and took this pill.  The first week is horrible and the side effects are bad but luckily my doctor warned me and said just make it through the first week and you will be okay.  By the second week the side effects faded and I was back to my old self (before anxiety) but even better.  Don't hesitate to take this, I wish I took it sooner!",10,94
Lexapro,I have severe anxiety and panic attacks. I have been on Lexapro about 4 different times. I never learn my lesson.  After 6 months or so I think I am doing good enough to wean myself off and within 6 months I am back in the ER with a severe panic attack. I should just stay on it. This time around I started on 5mg and then bumped it to 10mg after 3 days. I am on day 2 of 10mg. I finally feel some relief. I have not left my house in a week- trapped due to panic attacks and today I was able to walks dogs and go to the store. Thank God there is something like Lexapro out there or else I would surely be in a mental institution.,9,56
Lexapro,"After a stressful event in my mid 20's I experienced full-blown anxiety.  I had hypochondriasis to be exact. I thought I had every serious illness you can imagine.  I finally hit rock bottom when I was missing a ton of work due to panic attacks and endless doctor visits.  My doctor prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro.  I decided to cut the pill in half and only take 5 mg a day.  Such a small dose and it made a huge difference! It was a miracle that saved me from a very sad life of constant fear. Since taking the 1st pill, I never experienced another panic attack.  I am happy to report that I came off the medication a year ago and I am still anxiety free. I highly recommend it.  I had severe severe anxiety and all it took was 5 mg a day to fix it.",9,86
Lexapro,"Lexapro saved my life. Be patient took about 7 weeks before I started feeling better. Started on 5mg, went up to 20mg now taking 15mg for the last 12 months. It cleared my thoughts and calmed me down...a life saver.",9,44
Lexapro,Been taking 20mg per day of Lexapro for 15 months now. Was diagnosed with anxiety and slight depression. Would have panic attacks and hyperventilate. Took about 4 weeks to see full effect. Was given Klonopin as needed until Lexapro kicked in. It has made me feel so much better. I have not had a panic attack in a year. I can actually get out of bed in the morning now. At first it would make me very tired when I took it but that stopped after a few months. It made a huge difference in my life. Did not really have any side effects. A little weight gain but I would rather have that then have panic attacks.,10,42
Lexapro,"I'm on day 2 of taking Lexapro and it's causing unpleasant side effects. I don't have an appetite, a slight headache, nervousness, and stinging chest pain along with stomachache. My doctor told me to stick with it because the benefits outweigh any issues right now. He also said that they will go away in 2 weeks or so.  I'll continue to take and update my progress.",3,31
Lexapro,"I was experiencing some awful symptoms such as chest pains, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations.  Even though countless tests showed I was in great physical condition, I found it very hard to believe that such things could simply be caused by anxiety.  I guess I'm a believer now!  I am on 10 mg Lexapro and the difference 2 months on this medicine has made is fantastic.  When I once feared I would be crippled by these anxiety symptoms, now I can barely even remember them.  I'm feeling like me again.  Side effects included digestive problems (went away after a week or so) and insomnia (countered by taking Lexapro in the morning).  SO RELIEVED!",8,53
Lexapro,"I'm male, 59, suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. It took a month for this medicine to kick in.  STICK WITH IT. I sweated like anything at night for the first 3 weeks but that stopped. I wake up briefly at 3:00 or 4:00 am (A side effect) BUT it is totally worth it. Previously I had knots, big suckers, in my stomach for nearly a year. I used to worry and then look for things to worry about and then initiate my flow chart of worry. No more. A positive side effect is Lexapro. Can also impact/stop obsessive compulsive disorder behaviors too (like counting this and counting that) I also was under-weight forever and have gained weight. A negative is a diminished ability to ejaculate - but again -so what.",10,42
Lexapro,"Miracle worker.  Took about six weeks to start fully working and the side effects were not so pleasant at first.  Now taking 20mg daily, I have no side effects and feel great.  During the first few weeks taking it, I would have extremely good moods that almost seemed imaginable and then I would go back to feeling sad.  Then eventually that went away.  One negative about Lexapro is that my stomach isn't as strong as it was before and a lot of foods bother it.  All I can do is eat healthy and take pro-biotics.  VERY HAPPY with Lexapro.",10,33
Lexapro,"This medicine is a life saver.  I was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder in the spring of 2011, and I was on 30mg for a year.  The only side effect I had was lack of sex drive/ability.  Because of this, I weaned off it, and all of my anxiety and panic attacks came back.  I was miserable for about 2 months until I went back on it.  I've tried Zoloft, Remeron, and Wellbutrin, but Lexapro is the only one that worked for me.  I had zero panic attacks on Lexapro and enjoyed life.  I am currently back on 10mg and will be moving up to 20mg shortly. Everyone's experience differs with these kinds of medicines, but my advice is: stay on it.  The first few weeks might be rough, but as long as the side effects aren't terrible, give it time.",9,40
Lexapro,"My story is really long and complicated. I was originally on Xanax and all it did was make me sleep. Switched doctors because my original doctor wouldn't switch me off the Xanax. New doctor prescribed me Lexapro. I was upset at first because I didn't feel I needed it, I thought Lexapro was an anti-depressant and I wasn't depressed.. About a month after I started taking the Lexapro I felt amazing! But then I lost my health insurance so they put me on Paxil. I miss my Lexapro! It was the best.",10,26
Lexapro,"I have never taken the time to actually write a comment on these types of things, but this is worthy of it. I had never dealt with anxiety until I became pregnant. I suffered with the worst anxiety and I was MISERABLE. I had panic attacks that sent me to the ER..I was too scared to drive, missed weeks of work and literally did not leave the house. I suffered through it until I had the baby. After, my doctor put me on Lexapro. After a few weeks, I felt 100% better. I can't begin to explain the change I had felt. I was able to do things without thinking the worst of everything. Before I started taking it, it depressed me because I thought I was going to feel that way forever and always have to deal with anxiety. Now, I live a normal life!",10,65
Lexapro,"Incredible medicine. Took maybe 4-6 weeks to kick in though, but when it did, WOW. I was having a panic attack every morning and was relying on a benzodiazepine to live a normal life.  During the best of times, it has completely muted my anxiety. Sometimes I still get slightly anxious, but it's like the volume is turned way down. Have had maybe one panic attack (if I can even call it that, it was so mild) since it kicked in.  I'm happier, calmer, and more balanced. Only side effect was slightly disturbed sleep for 2 days when I started (and for a day or two after I increased the dose), and increased anxiety on the first day. I'm on 15mg and I couldn't be happier.",10,36
Lexapro,"Have had mild anxiety issues since early 20s. Spiralled downwards with increasing anxiety after an injury that made me unable to work. Tried mirtazapine with temporary relief, but got worse again after a few weeks and before starting Lexapro anxiety was so bad that I was unable to work and that leaving the house resulted in panic attacks. Started Lexapro on a Friday. Felt absolutely terrible until Tuesday. Nauseous (relief from Reglan though), heavy anxiety, buzzing feeling in body. Then improvement came very gradually and very slowly for the next weeks. On week 8 now and honestly feel great. The crippling anxiety that was present 24/7 is gone and only on occasions do I feel it, only much milder and never in the form of panic attacks.",9,30
Lexapro,"It has alot of side effects that bothered me. I could not concentrate, I stayed tired all the time, I forgot alot of things at work, I just felt lost all the time. My sex drive was gone. My symtoms of anxiety were gone but so was everything else. I gained alot of weight also while taking this medication.",3,12
Lexapro,I have very few side effects. This medication is helping me for depression and anxiety. I fell a positive difference after 4 weeks.,10,13
Lexapro,"I've been taking Lexapro (10mg) for about a week for general anxiety and mild depression. It's taken the edge off already, particularly on the anxiety side. I am more productive at work and more open socially, without even noticing until afterwards. Side-effects have been mild: physical jitteriness, a lone bout of diarrhea and an odd sensation in my skin. I can best describe that as feeling like being in a hot, dry climate but without the sensation of heat - tight and tingling. No sexual side-effects so far. I was on Zoloft a few years ago for more debilitating depression and the side effects with that were much worse, so I feel very positive at this point.",8,20
Lexapro,"Been on and off anti depressants for 10 years (still can't believe it). Tried Paxil and currently take 10 mg of Lexapro.  Still do not feel well.  I find running helps me more than anything but I fear the day the running is too much. I'm 40 and in otherwise good health, but I feel pretty lousy almost every single day.  I am happy to read about people doing well on medication, but all I get from it is dizziness/lightheaded.  Still optimistic about one day looking back at this nightmare in disbelief.  Until then.",4,14
Lexapro,"It has helped in more ways than you can imagine. I am not 100%, but pretty close to be my normal self.",10,16
Lexapro,"I was on Lexapro awhile ago, but stopped taking it.  Then my anxiety and panic attacks started coming back, and the doctor wanted to try me on Zoloft.  I experienced horrible side effects, and it made my anxiety worse.  I said I didn't want to take a medicine that causes me MORE anxiety!  I asked if I could PLEASE go back on Lexapro, it had a couple of side effects but nothing like Zoloft.  This is my 3rd day on it again, and already I can tell a big difference.  I would rather take medicine to make me feel normal again than try to tell myself I don't need it.  Because it's not worth spending life depressed and anxious over everything.  I would definitely recommend trying it, to improve the quality of life for an anxious personality.",10,44
Lexapro,"I have been on Lexapro 5mgs, 10mgs and 20mgs over a period of 6 years. 10mgs daily seems to be the best dosage for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Many people don't realize that it takes 4 to 6 weeks for this medicine to work. The first 3 days I felt very good and then felt tired or depressed for a couple days. Taking Lexapro with Klonopin 0.5mgs (2x daily) helps those early stage side effects.  20mgs tends to increase aggressive behavior. After about 5 weeks I found myself to be more confident in activities and less concerned about what others would think of me. My side effects are, short term memory loss, difficulty falling asleep at night, lower sex drive, but longer Stamina when engaged in sex.",9,17
Lexapro,"This helped me talk some and I was enjoying life more, but I was so angry!",2,8
Lexapro,"Lexapro helped me a lot with my anxiety disorder / ADD symptoms ... The only thing is that Lexapro alone was not super effective for me, but when combined with Adderall and Klonopin it works amazingly -- none of the three medicines alone worked particularly well, but all three together work extremely well for anxiety, ADD and insomnia.",8,13
Lexapro,"This has worked for me 10mg once a day. I was on Paxil 20mg before and I put on so much weight, which is a side effect. I don't eat any differently. However I had to realize that while I was it no more panic or weight gain? I choose the weight gain. This medicine definitely helped me. I was unable to drive on highways I would have attacks even if I wasn't the one driving.  I think I gained a little more with this medicine but it is what it is and I have low sex drive.",0,9
Lexapro,"I am a 26 year old female.  I started Lexapro 10 mg a week ago.  I have experienced nausea, dry mouth, headaches and fatigue.  Rated it a 7 because I don't think I have been taking it long enough to notice any huge differences.  I do feel maybe slightly more calm and a little less blushing.  Here's hoping things get even better!",7,12
Lexapro,"On the 25th I was on day 3 and feeling awful and yes, it was like having a bad flu, vomiting, shakes, anxiety at an all time high because I wanted to feel better and the sickness just made me feel that I never was. But now day 6 and like the first time, I'm glad I stuck with it as I feel just great today and feel 'normal' so the side effects are very hard but it is worth it in the end.",9,17
Lexapro,"I started taking lexapro for anxiety associated with over analyzing everything.. parents separating.. and getting engaged. The side effects the first couple of weeks included nausea, dizziness, headaches and wide awake feeling at night. The pros: took away the thoughts running through my mind.. blushing.. helped even out all of my emotions.  The CONS: I stopped lexapro in December  before I wanted to get pregnant and 1 week later I had a massive migraine (never had one) and lost my ability to speak.. see.. it was awful.. rushed to the ER thinking I had a stroke.. everything came back fine. Just remember if you plan on getting off before pregnancy.. give yourself a good few mths. The withdrawls are a NIGHTMARE!!! Dizziness, nausea.,headaches",8,14
Lexapro,"I used this medicine 10 yrs ago after first child and it worked wonders. Now started it 3 days ago after suffering from anxiety, panic attacks for 2 years after bereavements. I have been feeling nausea, tiredness and just awful! Does this go away, really feel that I should stick with it as I want my life back (5mg).",0,5
Lexapro,I've been on this pill now (10mg) for 3 weeks. My anxiety has reached an all time high and I'm hardly able to get to work and function. Wake up every morning sick in the stomach. Not sure if its normal and gets better or if its just not for me..............,2,7
Lexapro,"I have only been on Lexapro 10mg for 5 days, but already my anxiety is better. I am a 16 year old, 5'8 female, 280lbs. The side effects were pretty bad the first 3 days or so, nervousness, increased sweating, nausea, headaches, etc., but I'm definitely starting to feel better. One positive side effect is that my appetite has decreased dramatically. Sometimes I have to make myself eat, and I can't eat as much as before. Of all the side effects, I hope this one stays!",8,19
Lexapro,"I have been on Lexapro for about 2  years now for anxiety disorder.  Works great, still have nervous moments but much better than I would be without it.  Only downside is MAJOR fatigue, can barely stay awake during the day.  Going to try switching it so that I take it at night instead of the morning, but if that doesn't work I'm going to need to change prescriptions.",8,10
Lexapro,"I was prescribed 10 mg a day for anxiety/panic attacks. I'd never taken any sort of SSRI before. I took one pill and it scared me, I threw up several hours later and had the worst panic attack of my life. But I don't know if that was me, or the pill. So two weeks later, I chopped it in half and have taken 5mg everyday for the past 6 months. It has completely turned down the volume of anxiety and paranoia. I may never be able to go off of it. I have not had weight gain, anorgasmia, or decreased sex drive. I love it. I can live my life, it has taken that fog surrounding everything away. If you are super sensitive to medications like me, I encourage you to start with the lowest dose possible.",9,37
Lexapro,"When I became pre-menopausal I developed increased anxiety, panic attacks, heart racing, etc. My doctor recommended Lexapro. Within 1 week of taking this medicine I noticed a difference. I became calmer, easier to live with and all my anxiety symptoms disappeared. Literally got my life back. This is a miracle.",9,30
Lexapro,"Lexapro is wonderful! I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder and was put on Lexapro about 5 months ago. I started with the 10mg does, but now taking 20mg. It took about 5 weeks for me to notice this medicine was working. I have not experienced any side effects so far and have actually lost weight since I have been on Lexapro. Instead of me being edgy, uptight, panicking, etc. I am now HAPPY and CALM! Lexapro is really a miracle.",10,37
Lexapro,"I have only been on Lexapro for 2 weeks now for my anxiety and depression. I also have a temper problem, the medicine so far helped my anxiety and got me more active but my anger has got worse. Maybe it's too soon to say if this medicine will help that. But overall I'm starting to like not having the anxious feeling anymore.",9,9
Lexapro,"If you are experiencing any symptoms of PMS, PMDD, or pre-menopausal symptoms, you may want to consider Lexapro. It has made such a significant change for the better in my life. I was beginning to think there was nothing that could help me or my husband and then a co-worker suggested Lexapro and I am so grateful she did. No mood swings, hot flashes, irritability and no more cold hands. My hands would get so cold and the rest of me would be going through a hot flash so I could never get comfortable but since I've been on Lexapro, none of the above mentioned symptoms are a problem any longer.",10,24
Lexapro,"46 YO Male 195lbs with 10 weeks Use: Suffered from anxiety and surely some depression due to prolonged anxiety. Started with 10mg at bedtime. No show-stopping side effects. My side effects were: anorgasmia, tinnitus, constipation, yawning, muscle tension in my neck, lower spine and stomach area, weak erection (initially), some lethargy and having to urinate in the night. At 10mg, anorgasmia was overcome after 14 days and at 20mg dose it took ANOTHER 35 days. I feel happier, more patient, less obsessive, and with reduced anxiety. Side effects now are: mild tinnitus, mild muscle tension in stomach and nightly bathroom run. My advice: Be VERY patient and get your brain chemicals stabilized before you worry about the sex. Your body will adapt again. I'll use it for life. Good luck!",10,46
Lexapro,"I'm a 30 yr old female. Recently I got promoted at work to a more stressful and pressured role, I also found out that my partner of 12yrs has been having an affair. I've turned to therapy and Lexapro to help me through this time. I've only been on it for a week and have already experienced an improvement. I started with 5mg, will move up to 10mg in a week. My issues were-social anxiety and mild depression, I'd say my anxiety has decreased by 60%, psych said that I takes 3-6weeks for it to really kick in, so can't wait. The worst part for me was my doctor started me off on 20mg and for 2 days I had extreme anxiety and moderate depression, but I read through some positive posts and decided to soldier on with it and am so happy that I did.",8,15
Lexapro,"It's not for me at all. Last night was the worst night of my life, it started about two weeks into taking Lexapro my friends and family said that they noticed changes but I felt more depressed than I have ever felt. The next two weeks into it I started feeling really off balance and trembly. Then last night happened, without warning, without a trigger, as I was trying to fall asleep I started getting lost in my head. I was forgetting how to think and I was forgetting words. It terrified me.",1,15
Lexapro,"I first took Lexapro some 4-5 yrs ago for anxiety. I don't think I was depressed just had a lot of anxiety through stress and if I drank, and I'm not talking a lot, a few beers, I would wake up all edgy, not hungover, pure anxiety, but I was feeling like that quite often.  It definitely worked right away and the anxiety ceased.  I eventually stopped taking it because I felt I didn't need it anymore.  4-5 years later, I was going through some serious depression.  My wife at the time suggested perhaps I go back on; this was definitely depression, much more than anxiety.  Anyway, it was disastrous!  The minute I started taking it, the depression got worse!  The Dr. told me to try to get through it for a week or two and I just couldn't.",6,6
Lexapro,"I'm a 33 year old male and have been on Lexapro for a little over a month now. The first day I felt like I drank tons of coffee..I felt good but wired. Then I felt tired all the time for the next following weeks. But for the past week or so I have been feeling awesome, more confident, talkative, happier but still very sleepy. It's great because I actually sleep the whole night but its so hard to wake up. I get to work late sometimes. I tried switching to taking it midday but by 7pm I'm ready for bed. I'm still happy and love it but the drowsiness and yawning are irritating because I want to do more with my evening.",9,10
Lexapro,Took about a month to work and has helped immensely.,10,16
Lexapro,"Lexapro worked great for anxiety, but I gained 45 pounds while on this medicine for 2 years.  It made me constantly hungry.",8,9
Lexapro,This medicine was a blessing. I was put on medicine for severe anxiety as well as helplessness/depression which was situational. Only side effect was tiredness which was fine and my sex drive is more active than before.  I am now off the medication but it definitely helped during the hard time in my life.  Because of a good doctor that listened and a combination of counseling...I am better!,10,27
Lexapro,"I had a rough time last year.  I was diagnosed with a terrible illness and it took me months to recover both physically and mentally.  And, to add insult to injury, I was a new mother.  I honestly lost myself in anxiety and sadness and refused to believe I needed medication to get back to myself.  But with therapy and a six-month trial of Lexapro, I came back to being me.  I had some nausea at first, but it subsided within a week or so.  And, when it was right for me to come off the medication, I did it under a doctor's care - gradually.  Lexapro worked for me by helping me focus on both on cognitive therapy and on moving on from the trauma.",9,19
Lexapro,"I was diagnosed with adjustment disorder (with anxiety). When big changes happen in my life, I get panic attacks and severe anxiety. I have been on Lexapro twice now, for a few months each time. Side effects: Initially, this medicine makes my anxiety worse, irritable, very sleepy, increased sweating and hot flashes. Luckily, these side effects have disappeared after about a week of taking the medicine. I take 10 mg of Lexapro. Side effects appeared the first day I took the medicine. The anxiety started to subside after a week. Anxiety disappeared after 2 weeks on 10 mg. No problems weaning off the medication. I love this medicine. It gave me my life back.",10,37
Lexapro,"I tried Lexapro because I was very high strung, was easily angered over the most minor incidents and was always worried about everything. Was hoping for any sign of relief. I didn't really notice any significant improvements in the first few weeks but I'm on the fourth month of taking it now and what a difference. It's not like a light bulb went off and I completely changed. I still get angry and worry but it goes away easily. You just don't care as deeply as you used to. For me it's worth it. I wouldn't call it a miracle but it most definitely takes the edge off. I am thrilled with it.",9,17
Lexapro,"I hope this helps others because I rarely leave feedback. Please stick with Lexapro if you are having side effects. They will subside. I am only on day 9. The first week I experienced increased anxiety, dilated eyes, gastrointestinal issues, shaky and sweaty hands. It's not nearly as bad now. Before starting this medication I was experiencing anxiety that blew up quickly, it started happening at night, which effected my sleep, which grew to chronic insomnia for 4 months and that led to me becoming depressed. The longest streak I had of no sleep at all was 6 days straight. I found out that insomnia was a symptom of anxiety/depression. I still have insomnia but its slowly getting better as the medicine gets in my system.",7,29
Lexapro,"I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder at 16. I was put on Xanax and Lexapro 20mg. After getting married and the birth of my second child we moved from NJ to FL. I was off Lexapro with both pregnancies. I moved 2 FL AT 25 WITH A 19 MONTH OLD AND 8 WEEK OLD! Post partum depression hit me hard. I went to a MD and requested Lexapro 20mg and Xanax 3mg/day. I have tried many many many other SSRIs due to cost of Lexapro. They all made me feel MORE nutty even Celexa, Lexapros brother. I ALWAYS wind up back on Lexapro. This is a miracle for me! I feel calmer within 24 hours and I can't make myself anxious if I tried. I sleep sound and am happy and a better mother. I love Lexapro and despite the price and 10lb weight gain. I'm 5'9 n 140 lbs.",10,25
Lexapro,"I requested this medication from my PCP for some mild-moderate anxiety.  I heard wonderful things about it and didn't think twice when I started taking it. I took it for about a week and it was the worst experience of my life.  I had tremors, insomnia, couldn't eat, spasms, restless but didn't want to do anything.  I wasn't depressed in the least prior to starting this medication but after the second dose I felt a depressed.. it was unbearable.  I was then prescribed Prozac and had a similar reaction. I lost 15lbs in 3 weeks.",1,7
Lexapro,"Was on Lexapro back in 2009 and it helped me a lot. I had a lot of stress and minor depression. I went off it a few months after I started because I felt so good, and that was a bad idea. I recently started taking it again and as of right now I'm going through some bad side effects. I normally don't feel bad at home but I'm stressing out. Can't eat, have a minor headache and I'm anxious as well. I hope this feeling ends soon.",5,3
Lexapro,"I started taking Lexapro about 6 years ago for anxiety and social phobia. It worked wonders with few to no apparent side effects. Its not a cure but has helped me manage my condition better than other medications I have tried in the past. It does get me a little sluggish every now and then, but the benefits outweigh the minor side effects. The main down side is the cost. Being that is not covered by insurance and no generic available I'm forced to switch to Celexa. My doctor okayed to try the switch and I've read decent reviews by people who use Celexa for anxiety.",9,5
Lexapro,"I had irritable bowel syndrome for 6 years and in the last 3 years it was preventing me from having a good quality of life. I was too anxious to do so many things because I couldn't trust my body to hold it together for any length of time. I tried hypnosis, mindfulness and naturopathic treatments but then asked my doctor about SSRI antidepressants. The first few weeks are awful but stick with it. I was in emergency because I had a panic attack and thought I was dying. I am now on 15mg Lexapro. It has been 3 months and this is truly a miracle. I feel totally normal and feel every emotion except I just think and ruminate less. I don't obsess anymore about leaving the house-I just leave. The drug has also been constipating for me, which after 6 years of irritable bowel syndrome is incredible. Highly recommend.",9,14
Lexapro,"Was put on 10mg Lexapro for general anxiety.  I was on it for 5 days and just had to stop. Horrible anxiety, feelings of depression I have never had before, absolutely no appetite, migraine, bad dreams, falling asleep at work while getting more than enough sleep at night, forgetful in my everyday tasks, overall hazy and strange feeling.  Will go back to Ativan and will never take an SSRI for my anxiety again-not worth it.",2,8
Lexapro,"I am a female, in high school, 59 210 pounds. I had been dealing with anxiety for my whole life. I went to a therapist and it helped a little but it wasn't enough to make a dramatic difference. I finally decided to go to a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, and I also suffer from separation anxiety, some OCD, and social anxiety.  I went on Lexapro 5mg for one week then went to 5mg in the morning and 5mg at night. I have been on that dose for over a month and am night and day from how I was. I am finally the happy go lucky relaxed person my dad says he knew existed deep down. I have no complaints other than wishing I had started it years ago. I noticed a difference after one week. I recommend it 100%.",10,33
Lexapro,"I have struggled with severe generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety my entire life and now, at 24, I am just starting to realize how much it has affected my ability to live and enjoy life. I was started on Lexapro while overseas and suffering from depression due to the cold, rainy climate. I cannot tell you how much this medication has changed my life. I am now getting to know the confident, relaxed person that was hiding underneath my anxiety. I am only on 5 mg/ day but I have found that dose to be effective for me. Anything over 5 mg and I start to feel side effects like fatigue and marked decrease in libido.",9,11
Lexapro,"I have suffered from anxiety my whole life but it never got to the point where I felt like it was ruining parts of my life. Then both of my parents got sick and out of nowhere I could barely eat, go out and everyday felt like a battle. I was prescribed Lexapro and at first I was so anxious to take the medicine that the first week of taking it really spiked my anxiety. After about 10-14 days I felt amazing! I could eat again without feeling like I was choking on everything and I felt like my old self again. Actually like a better version of my old self. I would strongly recommend this medicine to anyone suffering from anxiety. Just know that it takes a little while for it to work and the first week can be terrible. Just stick with it!",10,38
Lexapro,"On my 7th day of Lexapro I developed a rash on my arms and was alarmed, especially when I read about the possibility of rash being a side effect of the medication.  With my doctor's guidance I treated the rash as a contact allergy (detergent, etc.) and kept taking the Lexapro. The rash came back one more time but never again.  Lexapro did not give me the sudden weight loss, dizziness, visual trails, nausea, etc. of other SSRI's I had tried before (Prozac worked for me, anxiety-wise, but the side effects were a bit much... Paxil resulted in extreme dizziness and was stopped after only a few days).  I find Lexapro worth the extra money and recommend it even to people who may have had bad experiences with SSRI's before.",9,7
Lexapro,"Was only able to take it till the 4th day due to the severe side effects. Lost all energy, couldn't eat, head pain etc. I think my body just has a hard time tolerating antidepressants.",1,16
Lexapro,Had to put up with 1 AM awakenings for the first few months on this medicine but it is good from anxiety/social anxiety.  No other side effects and seems helpful.,8,7
Lexapro,"Lexapro really helped me to feel more like myself. After a long time battling a mystery disease, I was debilitated, I couldn't function in my normal life, and was feeling just very strange. I decided that I would go to a psyche, and he prescribed me Lexapro. It really seemed to help. I eventually stopped taking it, and have been pretty much okay for the past 4 years or so, but now the symptoms are flaring up again, with some additional stuff so I am going through the medical rounds again to make sure there is nothing underlying. And if there's not then I'm going to suggest that I get back on Lexapro because it really did seem to help me! I didn't have any side effects with it that I can remember. It really worked well.",8,8
Lexapro,"Well I have to say I have be debating on trying this medicine. Then I gathered up enough nerve to try it and, 1st night I took did not sleep very well and the following day I just felt so out of it, It was caused for concern at my job. I can honestly say, in my case the side effects are far more worse than my anxiety.",1,3
Lexapro,"I have been on 5 mgs of Lexapro to treat anxiety/OCD for about 5 months. Lexapro is the best medication that I have been on (took Prozac on and off for about 6 yrs). It took about 3-4 months to get the full benefits of this medication. Initially I had the normal SSRI side effects (tired, nauseous, felt slower) but after I overcame them I have almost no side effects at all. I was nervous about weight gain because I gained 25 pounds on Prozac, but I have actually lost weight on Lexapro. I think if you just give it some time you will definitely see the full benefits.",0,22
Lexapro,"I am a 27yr old female, 115lbs. I have been on Lexapro for 2 months now for anxiety. I have never had any problems with anxiety until I started working full-time (a lot of hours that are non-stop) and I started planning my wedding. All of this made me very irritable, stressed to the max, edgy, worried about every little thing, and just not myself. Since I've been on Lexapro I've been back to myself and better. I'm relaxed and easy going through this stressful time! It took a few weeks for the medicine to kick in and for me to get over a few side effects (insomnia, constipation, tired in the afternoon) but it's totally worth it.",9,9
Lexapro,"I started on Lexapro 5mg November 2010 due to bad depression, anxiety just really bad, so went on it after seeing specialist. Upped my dosage to 10mg March 2011 and stabilized out, not up not down like normally off medicines. Back to 3 times a week exercise, no grog or eating benders anymore, lost 8 kgs (only another 6 to be back to my perfect weight) sleep better, helping me relax more in social situations as have bad GAD social, so keeping on it - no side effects - takes a while to level out so persist with it and give it a decent go.",9,12
Lexapro,"I've been on Lexapro twice. The 1st time started in the fall 2008. For some reason at the age of 42, I began having dizziness, anxiety, and panic attacks. I was diagnosed with GAD and prescribed 1 mg Ativan for use as needed in the short term and 10mg Lexapro for the long term. Within 3 weeks I increased to 20 mg Lexapro. Within another 3 weeks, my anxiety had all but vanished and I quit Ativan. My racing thoughts and worries subsided. I was able to sleep better at night and concentrate better at work. No weight gain either but I exercise regularly. I stayed on Lexapro for 1 yr. No problems getting off on a tapered schedule over 3 months. In spring 2011, anxiety returned due to marriage issues. Back on 10 mg Lexapro with same great results.",9,37
Lexapro,"I have been on Lexapro for about 12 days (never been on anything like this in my life). I am very sensitive to the medicine. I can take about 2.5- 5mg. I have some shakiness, and had increased anxiety in the beginning. It seems to be leveling off now. My doctor recommended that I take 5mg in the beginning and then increase to 10 mg later. I think 5mg is enough for me. I get night sweats as well. Lost weight, because I am not hungry; nauseated. The anxiety has decreased. Its working.",7,12
Lexapro,"I am 23 years old and have pretty intense Social Anxiety.  I starting taking Lexapro 10 mg for it when I was 21. The drug was effective at treating my anxiety, but with a trade-off: I felt no emotions.  It made me feel more confident, reduced my blood pressure, eliminated heart palpitations; but, I began to realize towards the end of my use of it that I was feeling no highs or lows.  My social life was great.  I got a girlfriend after not having one for half a decade, and have been with her for 2 years now.  But during my use of Lexapro, all of these successes were just me going through the motions.  Everything seemed surreal to me.  Six weeks ago, I switched to 5 mg, and I am not feeling intense anxiety again. Not sure what it is doing for me.",8,9
Lexapro,"While on Lexapro, I had the best and worst times of my life. I switched to Lexapro from Paxil in college and it made an immediate difference -- no more brain fog or fatigue, and all the anxiety fighting effects. I was very happy and able to deal with the high stress of superior achievement in a difficult major. However, one night I had too much to drink (not high enough BAC for alcohol poisioning, just more than I was used to) and woke up the next morning a fearful, panicked, and emotional wreck. That was over 2 and 1/2 yrs ago and I am still not the same person I used to be. I can't say for sure that the Lexapro and the alcohol caused this major change in me, but my time on Lexapro has certainly shown me the polar opposites of my life.",3,4
Lexapro,"This drug did very well for me initially, at 10mg.  My dosage over 7 years kept increasing and now I am convinced that over time this medicine will deplete your natural serotonin levels and fails to work or not work at all.  At 10mg the side effects were not that noticeable at all, but at 20 mg the side effects were much more pronounced  Especially lethargy, increased panic attacks/anxiety, weird dreams, and sexual side effects to name just a few. Everyone is different, but for me this drug worked well at a small does for about 21/2 years, then slowly stopped working to the point where I was just having side effects from the med.  Am tapering off it and feel very well so far.",6,15
Lexapro,"These glowing reviews are comical to me.  I have had anxiety most of my life, not all the time, but it has come and gone since I was a little girl.  At the urging of family members who have been on one happy pill or another trying to be happy (with no success I might add), I went to my MD and he gave me Lexapro. I took it for about 6 days, and on the 7th day. I was taken off by ambulance with a 3 day panic attack that I could do nothing about.  It scared by husband so bad, he was beside himself.  My blood pressure was extremely high, heart palpitations, a feeling of hypothermia, ice cold all over, could not urinate, etc.  Once in the hospital, the doctor had to give me a downer to counteract the Lexapro (an upper).",1,13
Lexapro,"I have always tended to dwell on things and make things more than they are for as long as I can remember. I am a 28 years old, young-professional who was laid off 4 months ago. Despite not being too distraught about being laid-off I thought, I began having panic episodes about 3-4 month where symptoms resembled a heart attack. After an ER and 2 Doctors visits, I was prescribed Lexapro. I started the treatment Monday night, and no lie was on cloud 9 Tuesday morning all day and into Wednesday (today). I take 10mg once every other day! I have just taken my second dose and I am so much more at ease and this medicine is great for those with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Definite improvement in quality of life.",9,22
Lexapro,"I'm a college student, but ever since high school I've been suffering from depression and anxiety. Once I started taking Lexapro my senior year of high school it immediately helped with the depression immensely. I was less irritable and not so emotional all the time but as for the anxiety, it only helped very little. Right now, my anxiety is through the roof and I find myself stressing over every little thing. A lot of the times on the verge of tears. So for depression, Lexapro's an 8, but for anxiety I can only rank it about a 4.",7,5
Lexapro,"My Doctor started me on Xanax.  It helped with anxiety but it was a take as needed. I felt like I was waiting for a bomb to drop waiting for that lost feeling.  My Doctor switched me to Lexapro.  I've been on it for a week now, and I feel like my old self.  I'm amazed, and so is my family with the difference in my mood.  I feel so grateful.",10,31
Lexapro,"I'm a 33 year old female.  I've recently been prescribed Lexapro to help with anxiety and possibly some depression.  After learning that I also have AADD, I guess the anxiety &amp; depression kind of go hand in hand.  I have noticed a significant change in my well being while being on Lexapro.  I do other activities to help with the anxiety-breathing, meditation, exercise, and getting proper sleep...but it just wasn't enough.  I was tired of the constant struggle to maintain peace of mind.  After talking with my doctor she suggested Lexapro and felt I'd be a good candidate.  Boy, was she right.  So far the side effects have been minimal to none. Very pleased with this medication.",0,19
Lexapro,"Been taking Lexapro for about 5 weeks, so far the only side effect I have experienced has been fatigue, but overall my anxiety has been decreased. Doctor just added Wellbutrin so we will see how the two interact.",0,2
Lexapro,Started Lexapro 2 days ago. Haven't taken 3rd dose yet.  Been on buspirone (BUSPAR) which has helped.  Lately needed something more due to some travel.  Have severe headache.  Couldn't sleep last night. Very very dizzy.  Waiting to hear from the doctor. Tried Cymbalta with a very similar reaction.  Doesn't look like I'm going to be able to tolerate it.,3,5
Lexapro,I started taking this medicine about 4 months ago when I was dealing with a very hard breakup and suffering from panic attacks. My resistance to stress was at rock bottom when I started taking Lexapro and it stopped my panic attacks immediately. I realized I'd been dealing with anxiety my whole life and had just thought it was normal and a part of my basic personality. The side effects at first were difficulty sleeping and a lack of appetite.  The longer I've been on this medication the more even I have felt...able to handle stress but still be myself.  I'm so much more comfortable in social situations and all of my obsessive worrying is gone. Sleep and appetite are normal now. Still feel emotions but don't lose control.,9,25
Lexapro,"I'm a 47 year old female, been on 10mg Lexapro for 5 years for anxiety and depression that I've had since childhood. I had to add 300 mg Wellbutrin XL after, due to feeling overly sedated, and low libido. This combination has worked well for me, since the Wellbutrin has an up effect, and helps with sexual side effects. Tried to reduce the Lexapro to 5mg this fall, but had some anxiety start to return, went back to 10mg recently. Maybe just holiday stress. I'm so glad these medicines are around! Wish they could have been available for my brother who committed suicide several years ago. Wish I could have had the Lexapro at an earlier age but thankful now!",8,18
Lexapro,"I experience being thirsty all the time on this, but it eliminates cyclical worrying thoughts and decreases my irritability.  I do have difficulty reaching sexual climax, but can sometimes. But on the generic, I could not climax at all, so it is better in that regard.",9,4
Lexapro,"Last year I broke out in hives all over my body from an allergic reaction.  Had panic attacks and suffered from anxiety - tingling in head, crazy numbness and so on, all anxiety symptoms, made me feel like I was going crazy. Lexapro has been a miracle medicine for me. I've been taking it for about 6 months.  I feel so much more calm and no more anxiety symptoms or panic attacks.",10,19
Lexapro,"About 3 years ago I was on Lexapro 10mg, then I was off. Then about 9 months ago I was on Lexapro 10mg again then up to 20mg but my libido pretty much became non existent. I had weight gain, I tried working out but it didn't help the problem. It worked with my anxiety but after a while I felt like it was wearing off and I was becoming accustomed. I had lost my job and had no insurance so I couldn't afford my Lexapro, so I was cut off up until about 3 days ago. The withdrawals were INSANE, I had so many attacks and brain zaps I really wanted to crash my car into incoming traffic, I would have my mom come pick me up while I would park on the side of the road.",5,8
Lexapro,"I am 46 and was on Lexapro 20mg for about 3 months. Also taking Trazodone 75 mg at night for sleep. I think I may have needed the Lexapro then but after 3 months I decided to take myself of of it (Lexapro). I was having problems with insomnia. First week cut Lexapro to 10mg while taking a multivitamin along with vitamin D supplement (loading up in the mornings with some good carbohydrate for energy) supplements for energy. When I first started the multivitamin also starting jogging even when I was tired I would still push myself to jog. I have always been a healthy person never on medications, and I was already feeling better with more energy.",0,8
Lexapro,"I'm 31 and have been taken Lexapro before I wanted to go with something cheaper. My doctor prescribed a generic citalopram. I have been on that for about 7 months now. I can tell you I notice a difference in the 2 medications. Lexapro allows me to feel more motivated to get things done and generally helps me focus with less stress, while citalopram has had not much effect other than weight gain and still at times I get really irritable. Being a single father of 2 I'm going to ask my doctor to place me back on Lexapro so I will feel more proactive and not like a bump on a log that doesn't care.",9,11
Lexapro,I have been taking Lexapro for two months now for my anxiety. It has barely helped my anxiety and has left me feeling tired all day long. I also have gained weight and have completely lost my sex drive.,3,7
Lexapro,"A couple of weeks ago what I considered my  usual anxiety symptoms started getting worse and the doctor put me on Lexapro to calm my ever raging mood swings. I started out on 10 mg which threw me for a loop. I felt strange all the time, very fatigued but had insomnia, dry mouth, and felt emotionally numb. I almost quit taking it, but then decided to try something different. I don't know if I would recommend this for everyone, but I started taking 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 at night. I feel 100% better! I am very alert, sleep deeply, I don't have the mid afternoon slump, I am not as emotionally numb and I have so much energy.",10,33
Lexapro,Helped anxiety but major weight gain.,4,7
Lexapro,"In '97 I was suffering from depression so badly, I entered a clinical trial for antidepressants. Specifically, Effexor XR. I had never been on antidepressants before and I was astounded at how much better I felt. Then in '06, after the 2nd work supervisor said I had no sense of urgency I decided to switch medicines. My doctor said so many patients became apathetic after long term use. Getting off was a nightmare! But now I'm on Lexapro. It hasn't lifted me up like I'd like either, but maybe that's the way it's going to be. I experienced weight gain with Effexor and actually lost weight since I've been on Lexapro, which has been for about 2 years now. Would like to get off all medicines period.",7,6
Lexapro,"I have been on Lexapro for about 10 days. I noticed it working after about 3 days. My anxiety has completely dissipated. I have had severe social anxiety since I was a very young child, to the point that I just didn't speak most of the time. I battled with it for over 30 years on my own, thinking this was just the way I was. Finally, a new job and career caused my anxiety to sky rocket, rendering me unable to do my job properly. Since starting Lexapro I am now more free and less self conscious. I am talking to people comfortably and enjoying socializing a lot more. I don't snap at the children and don't sweat the small stuff. I haven't gained any weight (or lost any) and I just feel more like myself. The only downside: tired all the time.",9,18
Lexapro,"I have been taking Lexapro for over a year. Have gone from 10mg per day to 20mg per day. Switched between taking in the morning and taking at night. It has done nothing for me. I still have anger episodes, still worry constantly, and still big ups and downs. Hope to find something that helps soon. Good luck to all who are trying also.",2,5
Lexapro,"My cardiologist put me on Lexapro a year ago due to anxiety and heart palpitations.  I was very happy not to feel anxiety anymore and thought this is a miracle drug. Personally I thought I will stay all my life on Lexapro, this is how good it made me feel.  I slept well, I was very calm and was able to better deal with my chronic pain due to spinal cord damages. I blamed prednisone for my rheumatoid arthritis but when I found this board and read all of your opinions about Lexapro I realized what made me this way. I'm just not sure how I'll go off Lexapro.",9,14
Lexapro,"If you just started Lexapro and are considering quitting because of the side effects - don't! Trust me. Wait it out. It gets so much better. The first month I took Lexapro, I was extremely nauseous and anxious, and couldn't sleep at night. I've been on it now for six months and feel like a completely new, better person. The only side effect I experience is occasional drowsiness. I can sleep at night, I have no sexual side effects, and I haven't gained any weight. Also: Do NOT taper off this medicine without consulting your Doctor first and having him/her help you through it. If you take yourself off it (especially cold turkey) it will be horrible for you. Be smart and stay strong. The good definitely outweighs the bad.",8,74
Lexapro,"I'm 21 and have been taking Lexapro for over 4 years and have seen good results and bad. I had a panic attack after taking Zoloft and was hospitalized after a few days and began taking Lexapro afterwards and have had a few episodes. The biggest thing I think that has affected me was going off for a few days because it messed my system up. I am on 200mg in the morning and 100mg at night. I'm still struggling at times with public anxiety and depression, but still feel good after I take it. Next time I think I am going to ask for another medicine. For new users, I recommend it, but take it how you are prescribed and let your doctor know if its not working.",7,2
Lexapro,"I'm an 18 year old female who used to take Lexapro for anxiety/depression (20 mg) but went off of it for a couple years. Recently and for the first time I had a severe panic attack which landed me in the hospital, this happened two nights in a row. The doctor diagnosed me with Panic Disorder and Anxiety and prescribed me 10 mg of Lexapro daily and 5 mg of Xanax to take as needed. I took 10 mg of Lexapro the first morning but upped the dosage to 20 mg the following day. I'm on day 5 now and although the side effects (dizziness, loss of appetite, stomachache, lack of sex drive) I have noticed a significant improvement in my anxiety. I am only on day 5 so of course it'll take some time to fully see the effects.",9,8
Lexapro,"I have been on this medicine for several years.  I have anxiety and Lexapro works really good but don't miss a dose or try to wean yourself off.  It makes you dizzy and you get these Zaps; to my tongue and down my arm.  I am still not off it and went back to my normal dose.  Beware of weight gain, I eat very health and get pretty good physical activity and the weight just keeps creeping up.  Good luck!",4,7
Lexapro,"I suffered from anxiety for many years and as I got older it became horrible. Palpitations and things that do not seem to bother others would destroy me on the inside. I began taking Lexapro 10mg. At first it did help but then I started to have long lasting headaches...sensitive to light and feeling that I was numb from the neck up. I completely shut out the outside and withdrew from 90% of everything I liked. I read all of the reviews about the medicine as far a getting off of it, and I felt that it was pushing me further into a hole. I decided to take it every other day for one week, then half the dose and half the days. My advice is drink lots of water/ Fish oil every other day/ You must walk/ Eat even if you must force yourself/Sleep at night.",4,12
Lexapro,"After 2 heart surgeries I developed severe anxiety.  I also had constant chest pain that was not cardiac related as well as being afraid to sleep lying flat because I couldn't breathe.  Before that I was always the calmest person in any situation and suddenly being distracted by irrational fears was devastating for me.  My doctor prescribed Lexapro 20 mg daily which I initially did not take because I didn't want to be on an SSRI.  After a severe panic attack while on duty, I started taking the medication and experienced complete relief of my anxiety and panic attacks within a week.  I have not experienced any of the side effects except some gas, and my high sex drive has not been affected.",10,19
Lexapro,"I have to share my experience. I have developed anxiety over the last few months. Small panic attacks, moody behavior. My Doctor prescribed me the 4 week introduction pack 10mg I must be super sensitive. I took one pill and within an hour I was unable to function. Severe mania, made my anxiety worse. My eyes started to get really sensitive. This is the day after and I am still suffering.",1,19
Lexapro,"I took Lexapro from 2005 until about 1 month ago.  I have suffered from depression all of my life and have had bouts of panic attacks at various times.  I got on the Lexapro starting at 10mg but quickly went to 20mg as 10mg didn't really help.  I did notice a calming effect from the standpoint of anxiety and depression.  On the downside, I have gone from 170 pounds in 2005 to 200 pounds currently.  Also, during some extreme cases I took Xanax during the panic attacks to cope.   I am now trying to get off the Lexapro. I have taken 10mg for a month or two and now am about 1 month into not taking any.  The problem is, now I have had some very very almost panic attack nights and have had to take the 1mg of Xanax to help.",9,12
Lexapro,I just started Lexapro a week and a half ago.  I noticed results almost immediately.  The only side effect I encountered was a slight light-headed feeling that has since subsided for the most part.  I have felt like hell and have been struggling with anxiety/depression for the past six years without medication.  This stuff has literally saved my life.  I feel like my old self again.  My only regret is that I didn't try it sooner.,10,63
Lexapro,I have been on Lexapro for 3 months now. While I still have my moments I feel way more confident and can handle life's curve balls so much better.,9,17
Lexapro,"This is a drug that takes a long time to get fully into your system.  It does not just work after a day or a week.  I was on this medication from 2004 to 2007.  It worked pretty well (about 85%) for anxiety, but not very well for depression.  My nutritionist and Doctor agreed that it was the medication that caused me to gain 30 pounds (which by the way, does not help depression.) I had to keep a food journal and keep track of my activity level. The overall panic subsided, but at night when trying to fall asleep I would occasionally have chest pain, or rapid heartbeat, or trouble breathing.  You just have to try to find ways around medicines to cope.",6,15
Lexapro,Today was my first day using Lexapro. I have been put on a light dosage of 5mg/day. I don't know if it was just my wishful thinking or not but within a few hours I felt a little bit braver then usual. I felt like I could actually go into my local supermarket to do some shopping which I haven't done for over 2 years now. By the end of the day my brave thoughts had disappeared but it gave me hope that this treatment will work or at least help lower my anxiety. Keeping my fingers crossed.,8,21
Lexapro,"This is just my experiences and opinions. This medication has not helped me much for my anxiety or OCD. I am taking 10 mg once a day,  but now I don't know if maybe I need to increase my dose or change to something else.  The main problem I am having is that it has not seemed to help me much with my hand washing OCD and now I have become itchy from dry skin and scalp.",2,5
Lexapro,"I was on 10mg of Lexapro for 6 years for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It worked great! I wanted to see if I could have a good quality of life without it since I did gain 40 pounds in that time.  I am on a weight loss program now since I had to go back on Lexapro. Withdrawal wasn't too bad. It took 4 months and I was off of it for 4 months. Had new stressful things to deal with and that's why I am taking it again. It's a great medicine I feel, just have to watch your diet!",10,23
Lexapro,"I was prescribed 10 mg Lexapro in March of 2009 for anxiety. It worked well as far as the anxiety was concerned but I decided to stop taking it in April 2010 because of the side effects--weight gain (I gained about 10 pounds even though I was a consistent gym rat and my diet did not change) and a pretty much non existent libido. This is NOT A MEDICINE YOU CAN JUST STOP TAKING. My doctor weaned me off by having me take 5 mg everyday for 2 weeks and then 5 mg every other day for a week. The withdrawl symptoms were not bad until I stopped taking it all together. I've noticed I've been easily fatigued and have constant dizziness, which seems to be worse in the mornings--hopefully it will subside soon.",6,14
Lexapro,"I had been trying to convince my boyfriend of 6 years to go to the doctor and get something prescribed to treat his panic attacks, GAD, etc. At the beginning of last year he finally went to the doctor after enduring panic and anxiety for 5 or 6 years. The doctor prescribed him Xanax which helped a lot but he still was unable to do a lot of things. Today is his seventh day using Lexapro and I am already beginning to see a difference in him. The first 4 days he had some pretty shocking side effects, i.e. dry mouth, nausea, bit of dizziness and unable to reach orgasm. However judging by how well he is doing on day 7, I have very high hopes for this medicine and am excited that he is finally going to get to really enjoy life the way he deserves.",9,15
Lexapro,"I've been taking Lexapro since November of last year (2009) and it works great!  I used to get really nervous entering a room or place with large crowds and now it's easy being the center of attention, especially me wanting to be an actress and all...it really helps! I'm the person I've always wanted to be...confident, outgoing, and alot of other things.  Although, It would be great if I could do this without the medicine, however, I had tried getting off of it and the anxiety came right back. So, it just works great.  I don't get nervous or embarrassed easily anymore.  I'm not as moody either...it helps with that.  What more can I say?  If you suffer from anxiety, this is great! I no longer have panic attacks either.",10,44
Lexapro,Been on Lexapro 10 mg for 3 days now and the panic attacks went away but still have times where I feel like curling up in a ball and crying. I'm really jittery and feel like sleeping all the time. I'm hanging in there to see if it works...wish me luck!,4,22
Lexapro,I just started taking this yesterday. I have been on a low dose of Xanax 0.25 mg twice daily for about 3 months and noticed I was needing to take more of it to get the same effect. So I went to my doctor and he gave Lexapro but said to keep Xanax just in case. It helps but I know that if increased it is hard to get off of. I haven't taken Xanax today. This is my second day of Lexapro and I am getting tingles up my upper spine and neck. I can't get to sleep. I know a lot of it is probably just my body adjusting to it. I don't think the sudden Xanax reduction would have anything to do with it because I never took more than 0.75mg a day. I will give this medicine a month and see what happens.,0,12
Lexapro,"Been on Lexapro 7 days for OCD, anxiety. Male, 42, side effects, insomnia, delayed ejaculation, loss of appetite, sweating, decided to stop taking this. Good luck",0,10
Lexapro,"I am back on Lexapro after 2 years off. I commenced taking 20mg about 6 days ago and the side effects were quite severe for the first few days (No appetite, upset stomach, insomnia, fogginess, grinding, jittery, cold sweats and no sex drive). However, that has subsided a little and I am now feeling quite calm and much less toxic towards myself. I am actually feeling quite carefree for a change and things don't seem to be affecting me as they had been for too long...my head is giving me a holiday. It is great to know that they helped me before and I know that they are going to help me get through again.",9,17
Lexapro,This has really helped with my anxiety. I had some stomach upset (on an off) for the first couple of weeks but it all went and it is SO WORTH IT to feel the anxiety is so much better.,10,14
Lexapro,This has helped me get my life back.,10,16
Lexapro,"I am 20 years old. I have used Lexapro for two months. I must say it's great, anxiety and depression are gone.",9,17
Lexapro,"About 1.5 years ago, I had a very serious, nearly fatal skiing accident. The six months following my experience, I found myself petrified to drive, extremely nervous and plagued by nightmares. My anxiety eventually lead to depression - I lost all confidence, became extremely self critical and was highly dissatisfied with my life. Exercise and positive thought helped, but did not restore me to my previous self. I began taking 5mg of Lexapro about 11 months ago; I still get nervous, excited, happy, angry, sad - but now the feelings of sadness and anxiety do not overwhelm me. I feel like myself again! I have noticed a few side effects - dry mouth, some indigestion, periodic trouble sleeping (1x/month) and some trouble with orgasm.Not to bad!",8,10
Lexapro,"I found that Lexapro really elevated my mood drastically and helped my anxiety, but it also gave me severe insomnia, dreamy thinking, and the inability to pay attention.",7,10
Lexapro,"I feel obligated to share my experience with Lexapro.  Before seeking psychiatric treatment, I'd spend hours on this website (a well as others) reading reviews of Lexapro and similar SSRIs.  I suffer from GAD and Lexapro has helped tremendously.  The only downside was the side effects at first (unable to achieve orgasm, crazy dreams, extreme gas), but those have subsided.  My partner notices a complete turnaround in my stability.  I am very thankful for Lexapro.  I am so glad that I made it trough the first few weeks with the side effects.  This drug changed my life.",9,42
Lexapro,"My young daughter suffers from Tourette Syndrome, OCD and Anxiety. The Anxiety is a recent thing. She has never been treated before for her tics (TS) or OCD (which actually is relatively new as well). They started her on Lexapro and her anxiety was heightened as well as decreasing her appetite. Which is not good since her obsession is NOT throwing up from food. So for her, this medicine did not work. She also complained of being tired, more nausea than usual, etc. She wasn't on it long either. We just made the decision that we could not afford her to be worse. She is now on something else - fingers crossed that it'll work!",1,5
Lexapro,I love Lexapro! This drug has done wonders for my anxiety. I have had the sexual side effects - hard to get an orgasm. I will say that went away for me. It might take me a little longer but I'm totally enjoying sex now! Give it time and your body will adjust to it.,10,37
Lexapro,"Lexapro has helped my anxiety and depression and I am glad to be on it. Started in January of 2002 and it brought me back to my senses and I was able to get out of a bad relationship and meet my husband. The side effects are minimal and blend into my daily life without much thought. Sexual side effects can be frustrating but my husband and I have a system figured out that works for us. I will be upping to 20 mg from 15 mg because of some social anxiety over the last few months from a job loss and the isolation and excess worry that followed. For panic, I take klonopin which has been a life saver. Once Lexapro kicked in, I felt like I had always wanted to feel since the age of 15 - normal! Not sad, not scared, not worried or anxious.",8,28
Lexapro,"I have heardof this drug working well for others. However, I feel compelled to write my experience with this drug. I was given a four week supply of Lexapro by my doctor (10mg pills) because I had panic attacks two days in a row which I did not realize at the time was a result of over drinking. I ended up taking two pills total. The side effects I experienced were: EXTREME anxiety, nausea, headache, chest pains, cold sweats, sleeplessness, nervous energy, and just general mania. I was terrified that this would never go away. The side effects went away the fourth day after taking the second (and last) pill. That was however the worst and longest 4 days of my life. You WILL get through this!",1,26
Lexapro,I have gone through a lot these last 5 months from changing careers and moving and having two deaths in my family. I was having bad crying jags and feeling really down. My anxiety was very high. I have been on this medication for about 4 days now and I feel a sense of peace and all my mind-chatter has left. I know the full dose has not kicked in yet so I'm hoping to feel better and better. I was totally against taking anything but sometimes you just need that extra push. In the beginning I did feel very tired but that has lifted. I feel clear headed and plan to stay on this for a little just to get back to normal.,8,18
Lexapro,I LOVE LEXAPRO. I had really bad anxiety before Lexapro and now I feel much calmer and more in control of my life.  I only take 5mgs because my body is super sensitive but I can definitely feel and see a change.  Sometimes I still suffer from anxiety during PMS but during the rest of the month I'm so happy and life is so much easier to deal with.  Lexapro was a life saver for me.,10,54
Lexapro,If you have panic disorder this drug will make you a nervous wreck.,0,30
Lexapro,"Was prescribed this medicine to combat my generalized anxiety disorder. It worked fine for a few months, but then I got depressed.  I didn't want to leave the house, talk on the phone, or even text or email any friends at all.  I also gained 20 lbs.  That might have had something to do with the depression that suddenly came about also.  This might work for some people, but I was not one of them.",5,10
Lexapro,"Helped to take the edge off, but I had very vivid dreams that were bizarre in content.  Had problems sleeping and having quality of sleep.",4,9
Lexapro,"Lexapro has worked really well for my anxiety/depression issues. The only down side is that it pretty much killed my sex drive. In the process of finding a remedy for that, for my husband's sake!",9,14
Lexapro,"I have been taking Lexapro 20mg daily for 4 years now. Works great on my anxiety. Side effects: better concentration skills for work, lower sex drive but still works, normal appetite, if I miss to many days I lose some of my word memory abilities and a short vocabulary until I get my doses back on a daily regimen. I do have trouble going to sleep but sleep well when I finally get to sleep.",10,24
Lexapro,"My doctor and I tried various medications to help me with anxiety. Lexapro has been the most effective. I've been taking it for a couple of years - now at 40 mg. It does have side effects that have not dissipated: lack of sex drive, much heavier sweating, and a numbing of emotions. However, the calm I feel far outweighs those problems.",8,13
Lexapro,I'm a 38 year old female.  I've been on Lexapro 10mgs for 2 1/2 weeks now for severe anxiety due to marital issues.  It has definitely helped- I feel much calmer about my life and has given me back the feeling of being able to cope with life's current problems.  Before starting Lexapro I was taking Valium every couple days for anxiety and I haven't needed to take a single one since starting.  The one major side effect I noticed almost immediately was difficulty in reaching orgasm (which was never an issue in the past).  I'm not yet sure whether that's a deal breaker as I think the other SSRIs would have the same effect.,9,22
Lexapro,"For me, this drug has been amazing. I've had anxiety most of my life but over the past few years I started having panic attacks. I finally went to the doctor and he put me on Lexapro. I've been taking it for approximately 6 months and I started seeing results within the 1st week. I haven't gained any weight, in fact I've lost weight and sometimes have to make myself eat. It does make me sleepy, so I take it at night. For me it has worked wonders.",10,53
Lexapro,"I've been on Lexapro for 2 years and am now weening myself off.  I am giving this medicine a relatively high rating because it saved my social and academic life in under a month of beginning treatment.  However, after being on it for about 2 years it's effects have plateaued.  I am completely emotionally neutral to any situation.  Some may like this feeling, but I do not.  Example:  I get a D on an important term paper.  Emotion: I don't care.  Example: I get an A on an important term paper.  Emotion:  I don't care.  I'd at least like to feel something from emotional stimuli.  I will either be trying a different drug or giving a completely drugless life a chance.  Good luck to you all.",7,65
Lexapro,Lexapro has saved my life. I no longer feel anxiety or major depression. If I didn't find this antidepressant medication I would not be alive to this day. I am so thankful.,10,50
Lexapro,Side effects aren't worth it for me.,2,10
Lexapro,"My psychologist originally suggested Lexapro to treat my anxiety and panic disorder, then my doctor prescribed it. I was told that it is not habit forming and that it has low side effects and works well to treat panic disorder. I started out on 10mg for 3 weeks then went up to 20mg. My side effects have been mild and have included nausea (the first few days), weight loss (which I don't mind) because of decreased appetite, mild increased sweating, and recently trouble falling asleep. All in all I am very pleased with it and have had only one panic attack in over a month. I used to have multiple ones weekly. I feel like I am finally getting my life back and I would recommend this medicine to anyone.",10,146
Lexapro,"Lexapro is good it has really helped to calm me down. The first few days have been tough I have been nauseated, I have lost my appetite, I'm restless, but overall it really is making a difference and I have only been on it a few days. It hasn't helped my depression yet, but I have been told it takes a while.",7,11
Lexapro,"I started Lexapro 10 mg while my mother was terminally ill - very high stress period. It was like a miracle. Totally relaxed me and got me through a rough period. I only experienced two side effects - weight gain (10 lbs) and zero sex drive. Because of the weight gain, I decided to wean myself off a few months after my mother passed away with no problems at all. Then, six months later began suffering the worst anxiety with severe panic attacks. I immediately got back on Lexapro and will try to combat the weight gain with diet and exercise. It was a good drug for me.",8,28
Lexapro,"I'm female 24 years old, 190lbs. I was on 5 mg to 10mg now I'm at 20mg I have been on this medicine for 8 months. It makes me feel a little better but I have had bad dreams so now I take another pill to sleep.",5,2
Lexapro,"I was put on this for my anxiety disorder and my bulimia/anorexia. I was put on 5 mg and than bumped up to 15 mg over a months times. I started this drug three months ago and last month I had to be taken off. I had bruises all over my legs, I had no energy, I would fall asleep at 10pm and wake up at noon the next day and be taking a nap at 3pm. My anxiety improved some but those side effects were too much.",3,10
Lexapro,"I have always had anxiety, but after having my twins at 25 weeks the anxiety just got worst. After their long stay in the NICU and they were fine I thought things would get better but it became my everyday life. I have now been on Lexapro for 4 days and I am very excited of the effects already. I feel more relaxed and I don't get upset over the little things. I am actually losing weight and sleeping better. I wish I had gone to my MD sooner because I feel like I am on my way to being my old self again. I am now on my way to being a better mom and wife and that makes me feel great.",9,81
Lexapro,"I was on Paxil and switched to Lexapro a few years back (3) and have not had many side affects. It really does calm me down so I have become a nicer person, and shrug off things that I would normally go crazy about, less shouting etc. I take 20mg. I do feel it has made me lazier and as a result I have been putting on some weight as I exercise less. It does affect orgasms which are much harder to pull off and takes incredible effort. I tried 3 times to go off the drug cold turkey, with terrible results. I just became depressed. After a few days I just went back on it again and after 15 minutes felt the glow of calm come into my body and I was normal again.  It is addictive, to quit, definitely need to decrease dose gradually.",9,61
Lexapro,Since taking Lexapro for my anxiety I have not had any heart palpitations.,9,26
Lexapro,"Lexapro has been a God send for me. I started off with 10 mg and it didn't do a thing, so I was increased to 20 mg, and wow what a difference. I now find myself actually starting conversations with people - something the pre-Lexapro me could have never dreamed. I feel so much more relaxed - like a real person, finally. No side effects at all either except it definitely increases the effects of alcohol. Didn't really do much for my depression, but I think just feeling less anxious is helping it along.",10,30
Lexapro,"I have only been taking this medication for 2 weeks. It has been pretty up and down for me each and everyday. I requested help for anxiety made worse by PMS. I started on 2.5mg and had scary anxiety, worse than what I was even taking it for, mild dry mouth, dizziness, and head sensations that were not quite painful but annoying. Just when I thought it was getting better, side effects seem to come and go as they please. I know that 2 weeks is not a fair amount of time to evaluate the drug completely and while my PMS was improved this month, I feel different, and not in a good way. I don't know how much longer I will give it a go.",6,18
Lexapro,This worked well for my anxiety attacks,9,13
Lexapro,"I got into a burnout and had anxiety, depressive and obsessive thoughts. I couldn't sleep anymore. My Doctor initially prescribed Paxil but the side effects were horrible so she switched me to Lexapro. My symptoms gradually went away over a month. The only side effect I had was mild weight gain which I could not sweat off until I quit the medication. I stayed on Lexapro for just over a year while I also did CBT. I gradually quit over a 6-wk period with no withdrawal symptom. Lexapro litteraly saved my job, relationship and my sanity. I only have good comments to say about this drug.",9,116
Lexapro,"I found that in high stress situations, I still had some degree of anxiety (sweaty palms, holding my breath without realizing it, some shaking, etc) but overall my ability to handle anxiety evened out.  I was a lot less stressed and found decision making, dealing with my children, and talking in front of people to be much more manageable.  I was able to sleep better without waking up several times in a panic wondering what I had forgotten to do.  I stopped worrying about things.  This drug changed my life with a moderately low dose and with little to no side effects.",9,68
Lexapro,"10mg of this medication in the morning did wonders for my anxiety and depression.  I felt awful physically and mentally and it made me feel WAY normal again.  The side effects I experienced were heart palpitations, increase in stomach acid, occasional nausea, minor drowsiness, and dizziness upon standing.  None were bad enough to quit.",8,25
Lexapro,Was prescibed Lexapro for anxiety and panic disorder.  Only could give this a neutral 5 rating as the side effects stopped me after a week from experiencing the possible benefits.  I am told that this is a very good drug by my doctor and shrink alike.  It gave me more anxiety and crazy chest pains.  I was on 10mg daily.,5,12
Lexapro,"I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and was given Lexapro along with cognitive therapy. The first week Lexapro made me worse than I was originally. However, it worked wonders and has helped me immensely to get my life back in order.  I started on a light dosage at 10mg and in 4 weeks jumped to 20mg which is typical.  This combined with cognitive therapy has got me back on track.  I really didn't experience any side effects except feeling crappy when I first got on it.  Within 4 weeks it was fine.  To me it is like taking aspirin everyday now.",10,22
Lexapro,"I'm almost 40 years old and have been on 20mg Lexapro for 1 1/2 years just before the death of my mother.  The drug has been wonderful and has helped balance the stress and has limited my severe migraines.  The only concern is I gained a lot of weight and I have never had a weight problem until this drug.  The weight is settled mostly in my mid section. I am concerned with heart disease, artery problems, high cholesterol since these run in my family history.  Lexapro is amazing but factor in other health issues you could encounter on it.  I'm weighing my options to see if I am willing to risk the withdrawal effects, weight gain (I've read elsewhere it is difficult to lose the weight after going off Lexapro) or if my anxiety was because of my mother's death or everyday now.",0,19

If you experience side effects in the beginning please try to stick it out it is worth it. I had some side effects (restlessness, insomnia, worsening of panic episodes, dry mouth and sweating) but they went away after 4 weeks. The only bad thing about Lexapro is the weight gain.

It wasn't until I finally had a full on panic attack (felt like a heart attack) and had to go to hospital that I was prescribed Lexapro. I did not want to accept the fact that I needed to take medicine for something psychological. I always tried to fight things with my mind. Over the past 2 years I am glad I was prescribed Lexapro.

My 5 and 6 year olds even noticed a difference.  It took about 3 weeks to start feeling better.  I decided that I did not need it anymore and could control the anxiety.  The withdrawls were bad with stopping cold turkey.  After 8 months off, I am getting back on medication.  The only bad side affect is terrible weight gain.",0,25

A few hours after taking the second dose I had this wave of memories from the last year that made me go wow, I've over reacted, over thought, over cried, over expected from myself and others.  It does make me a bit sleepy so I take it before bed. My appetite is more normal now where I would eat to feel better now I am only eating when I'm hungry.

At the risk of sounding cliche, it is a miracle drug.  It completely changed my life, for the better.  I really cant even begin to say all the specific things it helped me change about myself.

I would be so afraid of what to eat and if something was going to make my blood sugar to high. Now I can eat healthy but not have to worry that to much fruit will make me sick.

Surprisingly, that is enough to stop the ruminating and make me a little drowsy, and that adds up to falling asleep.

A significant problem with Xanax and all others benzos is the amotivational symptoms that results from chronic use. It certainly becomes increasingly hard to perform basic tasks, as one feels TOO relaxed to get anything done.  Even more serious of a problem with Xanax in particular is its rebound effects that make the symptoms WORSE than before. Because Xanax is so powerful but short-acting, within just a couple, or maybe a few, hours of taking it, one feels the URGENT, overwhelming need to take more. It can quickly form dependence.

Frankly, it doesn't make me groggy, high, or anything other than normal.

Alprazolam,<b>Alprazolam Intensol (alprazolam):</b>			 I have been taking .25 generic Xanax for over 5 years mostly to help me fall asleep. Sometimes every night or every other night. This drug has saved my life because I was staying awake till 3 am every night for most of my adult life and it took a toll on my physical and mental health. Some times I can fall asleep without it and wont take it in fear of becoming addicted. But when I cant fall asleep it relaxes my mind enough to give me a good 6 hours of sleep. It saved my life because I nearly had a nervous breakdown from worrying about my family and the bad conditions in our country. Thanks to Xanax I am still here. Most of those who have issues are taking way to much too many times a day. Taking just .25 is all I need to sleep better.

I would say Xanax can be like magic when you feel like you're going through debilitating anxiety and have frequent panic attacks, but it is a quick fix and should be used as a short-term treatment while finding a long-term treatment, because I can see how physical and psychological dependency can easily develop - if the issue isn't addressed and use is frequently continued.

I try to deal with my anxiety holisticly but  sometimes that does not work. I think it all comes down to eating healthy and watching my sugar and carb and caffeine intake. Walking and doing stretches works for me but honestly  Having someone who really loves you and does not abuse you in anyway is the best answer but I don't think there's many people out there like that anymore.

I started it back when, after taking Paxil for a decade, it started to decrease its effectiveness and my anxiety and panic attacks were beginning to re-appear.  My psych switched me to Effexor, and while we were figuring out the best dose in combination with Buspar, I was desperate to have a fast-acting solution to the panic when I felt it coming on.  He gave me Xanax, but it didn't help with the overwhelming anxiety unless I took a few of them, and even then the improvement was minimal to moderate.

I now take 1/2 of a .25 mg tablet every 3 to 4 hours when needed for my tinnitus. It works to lessen the anxiety caused by the constant ringing in my ears and I try some days to take it only once or twice.

I continued using Xanax for more restful sleep but after about 3 months I realized that short and long term memory was WAY down.   Stopped Xanax and replaced with GABA and this seems to be a far better solution.   The Wellbutrin worked great, felt more energy the first week but did take 6-8 weeks to fully kick in.

When I take them as needed I don't become dependent on them. I think doctors disagree with this method because they feel that you need to counter the anxiety before you get it and that way you can learn to tolerate it.

Alprazolam,"In my experience, alprazolam can be extremely effective against anxiety, considerably addictive, and can easily create tolerance if the dosages are not carefully managed. It should not be used as a sleeping aid, since it tends to lose its hypnotic effects after some time of continuous usage. To avoid the tolerance and addictive issues, I recommend people to only take alprazolam in or before moments of anxiety. For cases of social anxiety, I recommend one to take alprazolam, 2 hours before social interaction. The dosage is, in my view, subjective, thus one should discover his optimal dosage, on an incremental basis.

With Xanax the sedation wore off after roughly 5-10 days which was the only thing I can complain off. I have been doing better at school, less worrisome tics, better sleep instead of waking up screaming. Longer acting was better for me than a rollercoaster ride of taking a lorazapam or xanax (same dose worked wonderfully for 6 years) and now I just found that this time of my life, I needed something long-acting that I wouldn't have to think about my anxiety or worry about it anymore.",0,60

Also cancels out ADHD stimulant medications.",8,3

I have taken probably 15-20 anxiety and depression meds in the last 10 years and many have bad side effects, buspar had none of those other than drowsiness - the only reason I keep buspar around is that it is very mild in my book - the effect is mild but the side effects are also mild or nonexistent",0,15

Still nothing. It feels like a placebo or something. I'll give it some stars for not giving me side effects like the SSRIs I can't tolerate.

Lack of focus, slowness to absorb information, poor impulse control, short-term memory loss. Physical side effects: tinnitus, dizzy spells, loss of balance, loss of appetite, weight gain, muscle cramps. Consumption of even small amounts of alcohol led to blackouts and (uncharacteristic) volatile outbursts. Work performance declined quickly, conflicts at home emerged.

This drug has allowed me to overcome this and talk about issues I have with someone, resolve issues faster, be more productive, etc. its drastically changed my life. Friends say Im more cordial. Basically makes you feel very calm and more carefree and to stop thinking 24/7 about silly things",0,198

After a brief hospitalization I finally decided it was time to fix it. So I saw a psychiatrist who put me on buspar. With my history of drug abuse, he decided to steer clear of benzos. Prozac, which I had successfully taken in the past, made my anxiety 10x worse. After taking my 1st dose of Buspar, my shaking ceased. Im quite familiar with the placebo effect and I guarantee you that was not what was happening. Even though all pharmacology info available says its not immediately effective for acute anxiety, it worked wonders for me. Maybe its the  re-wiring  of my brain after the meth use, maybe Im just nuts. So far, it has re-introduced me to lifes pleasures.

I take the Buspar three times a day and it took about a month to kick in. I've been on several of the benzodiazepine group before for anxiety (Valium, Xanax, Ativan) and the only advantage to those is that you can take as needed for anxiety and they work quickly. They are also highly addictive. Buspar is not addictive but must be taken regularly--not just for an anxiety attack. It doesn't work for an immediate attack. But if you take it regularly three times a day you won't have anxiety and you won't need the benzos. I think it is wonderful!",0,64

However, it did help decrease paranoia  that I get when smoking marijuana. Im currently on 1/2 pill every 6 hours and I feel as though its still not enough, but more of it would make me nauseated.

I do have other health concerns and issues, however he agreed that the cause of my increased heart rate was my anxiety. So in searching for the right preventative medication to calm my heart and mind, we started with Buspirone. First off, I tried to take as little as possible, and I STILL got so lightheaded that I had to lie down. I couldnt see straight. It did absolutely nothing for my anxiety. In fact it made me basically ADHD and couldnt sit still or be calm because of how dizzy I was. Everyone is different, but I honestly can say this drug is so not worth it.",1,11

I also had hydroxyzine added into the mix to slow down my panic attacks. My doctors were more worried about treating my depression more than anything. The anxiety was so crippling I was  literally having panic attacks almost every day and sometimes more than once a day. I finally had enough and told my doctor to take me off of the SSRI drugs(I honestly don't think that class of drugs agreed with my body anyway) and treat just my anxiety.

I kept thinking, where was this wonder medication the past 10 years of suffering. Week 3, Probably the worst anxiety of my life. I had the feeling of a constant panic attack for 3 days straight and led to the body flu. I stuck it out and by week 4, started to feel better. I decided to up the dose to 20 mgs a day. Let me tell you, the 10 mgs was probably too much. I couldn't even remember if I dropped my kids off at day care and still had anxiety. Week 7, upped to 25 mg. 10 mg in morning and evening, and 5 in afternoon. This lasted only 3 days, because I was so dizzy after taking the night doses, I had to close my eyes and fall asleep immediately. I am now on week 9, 15 mgs daily and feel pretty good....

(Due to the concern of being on the Xanax and Klonopin that had helped me control my anxiety and lead a normal life) My anxiety at night is heightened , my heart races , dizziness and a constant ringing in my ears has started. My doctor prescribed this telling me would just make me sleepy well she was wrong instead my heart is beating so fast and I don't want to get up cause dizzy and when I wake up the ringing still there it's driving me crazy won't go away . For me this isn't the med side effects too much",1,8
Buspirone,I was very scared to try buspirone for anxiety because of the bad reviews BUT trust me when I say this medication has helped me a lot. I went from having panic attacks and anxiety everyday to living a normal life. I went from 5 mg twice a day to 15 mg twice a day. I went from quitting my job and having debilitating anxiety to getting back to a normal life. I wasnt able to go to stores or even drive and Im now able to.,10,40
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 My new dr wouldn't prescribe my usual combo of Prozac with Xanax as needed.  I was mad but gave the buspar for anxiety a try and it works out to be  BEST COMBO EVER!! I actually felt euphoria and a bit light headed the first few days. Then in the first few months when I had had alcohol in addition to wine one night, I got EXTREMELY SICK. But as a social drinker  decided to try again lol but only with wine. Everything has been fine since. I can even have margaritas etc again. (But I can't stress enough how scary and extreme that sickness was in the beginning, so drinkers BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL.) My family says they have never seen me so happy in all my 46 yrs. I am sure that I've never had such an easy going attitude. Things I used to take personally have no effect on me now.  I take two 5mg tabs at night before bed. This works for me even though it isn't what is recommended (I.e.2 or 3x daily doses) No more obsessive worries, thin skin reactions or depression!!",0,65
Buspirone,"This drug is working for me. I avoided a lot of the side effects by titrating up slowly from 5mg to 20mg (over 2 weeks). Then began the long waiting game for it to take effect. It took 3 more weeks (5 total) to start working. Hardest part was waiting and the various side effects, especially the nervousness. I take this with lexapro, as a booster. From reading the reviews, I think people jump in too fast and then dont wait long enough for it to work. I did not experience any of the insomnia and brain zaps mentioned here. I take 15 mg 2x per day, in the morning and afternoon. Now that its working, it works well.  If your doctor prescribes it, go slow and persevere. I asked my doctor if it really works and he said hes been prescribing it for 30 years and yes, it works.",10,21

Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 It's an excuse drug for doctor's to write because,  because the drugs that actually work are controlled substances.

Buspirone,<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I was prescribed 5mg buspirone 3 times a day for anxiety. I understood that the medication would take up to a month to start having an effect. This is due to the need for buspirone to build up in your brain's receptors. I had a great improvement with my overall generalized anxiety after about 3 weeks. This is not a medication that will give you a high effect.  Sure everyone's chemical makeup is different but this is not the reason you see so many negative reviews about buspirone.,0,36

Buspirone,"I was put on 10 mg of Buspirone twice a day for breakthrough anxiety.  I used it only as needed but my doctor told me that in order for it to help I had to take it as prescribed.  I started taking it twice a day, and at some point thought that it was making me feel worse.  About 10 days ago after a couple of weeks on this dosage I experienced crippling anxiety, stiff muscles, urinary problems, jerky movements in my arms and legs, shortness of breath, lightheaded, and finally full-blown panic attacks which I had never had before.  From Wednesday to Saturday I had 3 hours of sleep, no appetite and my right knee became swollen, red, painful and I couldn't bend it or my fingers.  This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had and the worst reaction to medication.  Angry outbursts, nausea and confusion.

Buspirone,"The third week on buspirone for anxiety and  I developed  side effects of tachycardia, didnt sleep more than 3 hours/night, I also developed tremors, fever, muscle aches, bone pain. I also developed chest pain and pressure. It became so bad I was close to fainting constantly. I thought my thyroid problems had come back.  At the end of the third week, went to the doctor who told me to immediately discontinue.  I had an ECG which was normal and so was my thyroid . But it was the worse experience I had with a medication and I had become so exhausted and confused I didnt realize I had to stop until the doctor told me so.  Please, be careful with this medication. If it works for you, thats wonderful. However, if you start developing weird symptoms go talk to your doctor right away.

Being only 48 years old, active and eating very healthy, nonsmoker, etc. I knew the cause of the high blood pressure that caused my stroke wasn't physical, as I've been diagnosed with depression years ago, and my situation in life has gotten far worse since then, as I continue living in a hostile environment. Luckily I found a doctor who agreed. Unfortunately, he prescribed me buspirone. Just like two other antidepressant type drugs I've been prescribed in the past, it does absolutely nothing to help my anxiety or depression.

I have taken this medication in the past 5 years ago and stopped, and now just started taking it when I feel I need it. After taking it it does make my head feel weird after taking it-almost like brain zaps. This dissipates after 20-30 min.  It helps when take it with food. I have only taken it for the past 3 weeks.

Now I am sleeping through most of the night without sleep aids or waking up with that nervous feeling in my stomach. I am now motivated to do things again too. I'm really sensitive to drugs but I did up my intake to 7.5mg/2x day. My history of taking drugs with serotonin has been so-so, so I'm not over the top excited about this drug, but I am definitely able to function and my relationships are way better!",0,43
Buspirone,"I started taking buspirone in conjunction with my Luvox (which had basically lost all efficacy from my being on it for years). 5mg 2x per day (10mg total). WOW. I finally felt 'normal'!! Very chilled out, as someone else described - 'It feels like I had a 6-pack and a big meal' - accurate! Before this I always constantly have looping, obsessive thoughts, but within even just 1 week of taking it, they had calmed down significantly. I can enjoy the small things in life without overthinking too much; I can now choose what I really need to worry about and what is pointless to worry about. I will say, the first few days my anxiety spiked and I had insomnia and some GI issues. After that, it was fine! In fact, I could finally eat again because all the knots in my stomach had calmed down. The only downside is it can make you a bit drowsy, but if anything this helps with my anxiety and I just push through it. Really helped boost my mood!",9,17
Buspirone,"I wanted so badly for buspirone to work for my anxiety.  I tried playing with the dosages.   From 2.5 x 3, 5 x 3, 7.5 x 3.  The first few weeks is seemed like it was going to work and then after I increased it to 7.5 I took a turn for the worst and it made my OCD ramp up!    I am not saying it can't work for someone else, as for me it gave me such a heightened anxiety I almost couldn't function at work.   Use with caution as it made me cry every day.",2,3

Buspirone,"I have anxiety and I've been on so many antidepressants, stimulants, and anxiolytics, but the doctor I see doesn't prescribe benzodiazepines because they're unsafe. I haven't been able to try Xanax and they won't let me take Ambien for sleep. I'm stuck with buspirone for anxiety &amp; clonidine and amitriptyline, currently, for sleep. It's getting to the point where I don't even want to leave the house alone anymore because I'm so terrified of everything. I don't think the buspirone is helping at all, but I don't want to lose this doctor. She's very accommodating and I feel like if I go see a new doctor and ask for Xanax or Ambien, it will look suspicious - even though I've been in treatment for years. I hate suffering when I know there are other options out there..",3,12

I have never had such really dark thoughts before but on this drug for two weeks I was scared to even be alone because I didnt know what I was capable of. I wanted to live but my mind would tell me different.  I had high hopes but reading these reviews I'm glad Im not alone. I just got off of it cold turkey, 6 weeks and 4 days.

As much as I want to control it, I cant. I have been taking The 5 MG dose. I am afraid to tell my dr because of a possible increase in dosage.

But that all went away with the exception of slight dizziness for 30 mins or so after taking it. When it happens comes comes and goes fast. Doesn't always happen. My anxiety is almost non existent. I can concentrate better especially in conversations, which before my mind would wander then race when talking to others. Which turns into anxiety attacks. Buspirone helps my mind stay focused on the conversation. I'm more confident in these situations. So far this drug is exactly what I needed.",10,26

In addition to major anxiety, I have bipolar disorder and a personality disorder. I cannot say I've seen any improvement in anxiety symptoms whatsoever since I began buspirone.

Heart palpitations, violent tremors, excessive pain induced by anxiety, etc. The heart palpitations are somewhat painful, and the shortness of breath becomes concerning. I intend to discontinue it because in a nutshell: I'm a lot worse. Taken with: lithium, thorazine, Vistaril, and trazodone. All 4 of which I've been on in the past, and all 4 of which have never made me feel this way. Busparin makes me tired and that's about it, the anxiety is much worse than it was.",1,5
Buspirone,"This is my third time on buspar. I took it two times prior with first time didn't notice much difference, but dizziness, but I only took for two weeks. Tried again years later and felt like a zombie (nausea, dizzy, didnt want to get up off the couch for anything). After months of trying to increase me on trazodone (worked great for occasional sleeping pill, did nothing for my anxiety and had sexual side effects taking so much everyday) my doctor suggested trying buspar again, but starting at a lower dose and increasing as needed. It took increasing the dose a few times over the course of about 2 months. But I FINALLY have some symptom relief with hardly any side effects (just a little sleepy when I take with food in the morning).

However, after two months of taking this I started to develop memory loss and confusion.

Buspar sent me into a horrible, deep pit of despair, unlike I had ever known, or could even imagine anyone having. The doctor kept telling me it would take awhile to work, but after two weeks, Buspar never did. I got off of it and, while still anxious about surgery, had no more extreme depression. The despair, caused by Buspar was far worse than the surgery. If I had to choose, I would gladly have that surgery again rather than take another round of Buspar.

I don't necessarily mean that I stuff myself with food until I feel like I'm going to get sick or I've eaten way too much. Just the feeling of there's a stopping point, that stopping point doesn't seem to be there anymore. Now, mentally I have to keep in mind how much I've eaten and even though I don't have that feeling of being full (I'm not hungry anymore feeling), I have to STOP irregardless.

What I mean is that unlike the SSRI that worked for me in the past, I still have the thoughts that cause the anxiety (the SSRI seemed to squash any negative thoughts), but at least my heart isn't racing, I don't have that deep sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, and I'm not sweating like crazy. I do feel pretty lazy and tired on it though. Better than getting hooked on a benzo and at least  I can get some sleep. It is has minimal side effects on me, which is what we expected with my Genesight results.",0,39
Buspirone,I had very low expectations of buspirone but was prescribed as an add-on to lexapro.  I had been on lexapro  for a number of years and this was supposed to help it work better.

First of all it did nothing for the anxiety but it did make me more moody and irritable (probably because it made me feel so crappy).  Had vivid terrible lucid dreams at first but that went away after a week. I had a constant headache that didn't go away, was more tired, very dizzy, nauseous yet had cravings, had to pee all the time, hot flashes and sweating, insomnia, also felt achey.

Only problem - as the weeks and months went on, I began to notice something ... my appetite was out of control. I was CONSTANTLY hungry! This was not ok with me!  I knew it had to be the Buspar, as I had changed nothing else in my life.  So, after 3.5 months on, I had to make a decision - do I stay constantly hungry and have little to no anxiety, along with weight gain, or do I go off and deal with anxiety again??  I decided to go off. I quit cold turkey. ZERO withdrawal symptoms!! Has my anxiety returned?  Maybe ever so slightly... increased appetite and weight gain are not listed as possible side effects, but Im noticing with a lot of people it seems to be very common!",0,36

I have worked down to 10mg for now but after reading reviews I am ready to quit. I had a few panic attacks recently and I can't go on like this.

The Buspar has been an absolute Godsend for me. The Clonozepam worked, but pretty much flatlined my personality.

I've also tried Zoloft, paxil, lexapro, Prozac, remeron(this is the worst), trazadone and benzos. SSRI's cause weird side effects and also cause sexual disfunction.

I took it for almost 3 weeks hoping side effects would pass but it only got worse. Light headed, dizziness, my skin was so itchy I couldnt hardly stand it. I felt like I wanted to jump out of my skin. I couldnt go outside &amp; be in the sun because I got hot within 5 seconds and felt sick.

I thought I would try it and the first couple of weeks I thought this was going to be a winner.  By the 3-4 week I had my first panic attack.  Other symptoms where muscle cramps, tingling up the back of my neck and head, feeling like my skin was crawling.  This was on 5 mg. twice daily and I can tell you it didn't make me sleepy.

Buspirone,"I was battling horrible mood swings and then my mother died which made them 10x worse. I begged therapists and doctors to help me medicate as I had been battling what I believed was bipolar and sensory disorders for years (it was actually a mixture of severe anxiety and mild depression). I finally was put on a combo of wellbutrin and buspar and it has done me wonders. Although I do feel a little sedated and unfocused for about 20 minutes after taking the buspar, I would trade that over the way I felt before any day.

I would rather go through the withdrawal from benzos than the side effects from buspirone. It has the most intense side effects I've ever felt. Way worse than starting Cymbalta which was kinda bad. I haven't really slept now for 3 days. It doesn't cause me any anxiety but the side effects, lightheadedness, headaches, tinnitus, lethargic, muscle weakness, my entire body has this super intense tingling and itching sensation,  pounding heart beat, and loss of appetite are intense enough for the last 3 days that I can't sleep. I'm past my point of being able to tolerate the sides. I have to say this one just isn't for me at all. Worst damn medication I've tried for social anxiety ever. Can't wait for this to clear my system so I can finally sleep and regain some sanity. I would rather deal with the anxiety than this feeling.",1,14

I was on Buspar several years ago and stopped because I didn't feel I needed it anymore, that was a mistake. I suffer from GAD which was destroying my life. Racing thoughts, stomach problems, constant fear and panic. This medication is not a Benzo so dont expect immediate results, for me it took approx 2 weeks before I really started to feel the effects This drug is not an SSRI and it hasn't caused any sexual problems for me as some SSRIs are known to do. The side effects I have experienced are flushing and dizziness however they subside about an hour after taking. Buspar does have a fairly short half life and I can feel the effects diminish after about 4 hours. Im also on Valium 2mg (10 per month) as needed when my anxiety becomes elevated but while on Buspar I haven't really had a need for the Valium but I'm glad I have it just in case.

Before Buspar, I was debilitated by Social Anxiety Disorder. Avoidance, panic attacks, isolation... etc. Without Buspar, I felt like my whole body was raw all of the time. I started taking Buspar about 3.5 years ago and the first thing I noticed was sleepiness. But other than that, no side effects. It took a while to start working, but when it did, I was finally able to feel relaxed in public. The biggest thing is that it sedates the body. It makes me less reactive and slows down my mind. I can see how for some, this can produce a sluggish feeling, but it's exactly what I needed. The sleepiness is not a huge issue anymore. Oh, and I take Buspar 15 mg three times a day. A major downside is that I have to take it every five hours, but it's seriously like my protective armor.",0,62
Buspirone,I take Valium and Xanax for severe anxiety + Effexor. I take 30mg Valium a day and up to 2mgs Xanax a day and it is often still not enough so I my doctor recommended trying the buspirone. I said not if it requires me to taper off benzos because I will have to taper slowly. He said I wouldnt have to get off benzos. I started with 10mg twice a day and the night dose was horrible! NIGHTMARES THAT WERE THE WORST! So I took 15mgs in the morning and 5mgs at around 1pm. Its helped a little bit but not much. I would not ever recommend it in the place of a benzo but to each their own.,5,5

This is just my experience and my body chemistry, but my ultimate opinion is its just another failed attempt to prevent prescribing Benzos.  Hope any of this helps.",0,43
Buspirone,I used to take this for anxiety and it worked great besides making me tired but otherwise no side effects.

It was going well until a few weeks in I noticed this dizzy feeling about 10 minutes after I took it and my insatiable desire for carbs. I had just lost my last 10 lbs so to see 5 of them come back on was disheartening! Weight gain wasn't listed as a side effect, but I know it caused me to gain weight and that was all I needed to know before I asked to be taken off it. I have decided to stop this medication.",0,23

Buspirone,I started this medication buspirone due to anxiety. I was struggling to leave my house and live my life due to the severity of my anxiety. I started 5mg twice a day and was told to increase to 10mg twice a day if need be. The first few days I had really bizarre dreams and drowsiness. I then started taking my first dose in the morning and my second dose no later than 2pm. This helped so much with the dreams. I sleep like a baby now. I tried increasing to 10mg but the drowsiness was too much. I just the 5mg now twice a day at 6am and 1pm. I take it with food and that alleviates the drowsiness. Dont give up on this med because of the side effects. There are ways to adjust dosing and dosing time to avoid the side effects. This drug has changed my life for the better.

This drug made me feel high and very uncomfortable. Made my panic attacks worse then they had ever been. I began getting very confused and unaware of places I was at. Began getting panic attacks every single day and started missing work. Decided to quit cold turkey. Couldnt get out of bed for days. My brain had a constant fog over it. Took a solid week to where I felt normal again. I would never recommend this drug to anyone. Stopping this medication was the best thing I could have ever done.",0,41
Buspirone,For me buspirone does not work at all for anxiety. They had me taking this twice a day and it is a joke. Doesnt work for anxiety at all and had terrible side effects. Discontinued it months ago and decided to choose the all-natural remedies instead.,1,9
Buspirone,"Let me start off by saying I was off buspirone for 2 weeks got back on it as I had terrible symptoms not being able to leave my house for two weeks.  The reasons was because I was so anxious to go to places where there was people.  I have even missed over two weeks of work.  It is the  worst experience ever. Some places that  I just had to go to and I had several panic attacks and crying in front of people so embarrassing. The second problem is being so nauseous -  lemonade and crackers are still my best friend until  the buspirone gets back in my system. My experience with buspirone 30mg is that I take it  twice daily and it is amazing, I'm a totally different person - I'm more calm and I sleep great and don't have racing thoughts or worry about going out into public. When I'm not on buspirone I can't function and I'm very sensitive and cry over everything. I'm glad I'm on this medication. Give it time. I take one in the morning and one at bed time. No problems with headaches but did notice when I am on it I don't have a taste for anything.",10,28
Buspirone,"Buspirone saved my life, it helped me sleep. I can take it or leave it without withdrawal. Its help stabilise my mood in regards to BPD. The only negative  thing is it can make you tired. This is not so good with my fibromyalgia symptoms. Although it makes me rest and thus pain is lesser after a few days I can miss the morning dose and do a few more things than I would be able to otherwise. Its also helped me stop cannabis which I use to use to relax. Thus I'm finally at the stages of complete smoking cessation including tobacco. My breathing is easier. I look forwards to cutting back.

Buspirone,"I am someone who is absolutely *hyper* sensitive to medicine. My psychiatrist suggested buspirone because of the terrible side effects I've gotten from SSRIs in the past. I tried half of a 7.5mg pill in the morning and half in the evening and of course had some side effects. But these were not NEARLY as debilitating as SSRIs. Admittedly, the brain fog was difficult to deal with the first week, and I definitely got headaches. So many reviews have said to push through the side effects and you come out feeling better. I stand here 11 days end and can attest to that; I am finally feeling some positive benefits and coming out of the fog. My pounding heart and sense of impending doom is greatly reduced, and I find myself being able to focus on one thing at a time due to the reduction in racing thoughts.

I said  sure  and Ive now been on it for 2 weeks. A couple days ago, I woke up feeling different. I didnt wake up to this dread and worry about everything and nothing. I was feeling very grateful for my family (I love my husband and children more than anything in this world but depression kept me from really enjoying them) and all I could think about were the good things in my life. That hasnt happened for over a decade. I even went out grocery shopping for the first time in over 4 years and enjoyed it!

Well I felt like I was gonna loose my mind AGAIN ! My skin feels  like bugs are crawling all over me, my scalp is a mess with scabs from scratching it . My TN. Is off the charts again and I cant leave the  house Im so full of anxiety .  I have a meltdown at 4:00 every day followed by 2-3 unscheduled every hour til I go to sleep.  I cant stand the face pain but my doc tells me not to stop because it takes time to work !",0,22
Buspirone,"My doctor recommended I try Buspirone out to help with my anxiety so I don't have to take my Ativan all the time. I was extremely reluctant because I don't like trying new medications and I'm terrified of feeling out of it and crazy side effects. I was prescribed 10mg once a day for a daily regimen, me being reluctant of new meds I broke it into 1/3 and took 1/3 of the 10mg for a few days, then went to 1/2 for a few days. I then tried 3/4 of a pill and did not like how it made me feel, kind of high and out of it. So I went back to 5mg and I've been taking it for 3 months now. It really has helped me tremendously, I haven't had to take my Ativan hardly at all, maybe twice in the past 3 months. The only side effects I have noticed is mild teeth chattering and jaw clenching.  I'm also on 150mg of Zoloft, 15mg of remeron, along with the 1mg Ativan (as needed) I mentioned above. The Buspirone has dramatically decreased my every day anxieties and panic attacks by at least 75%.",9,24
Buspirone,"My Dr. Started me on this when I was going thru a hard time at work and had such racing thoughts I could not sleep. Or if I did in 2-3 hrs I was awake again.  My mind still racing and now tired on top of it all! I take 5mg as needed, maybe 3X a day, it works great! At first, I may feel a little foggy in the head, but it passes quickly. It seems like I can face my day the bad issues and all without feeling tense, stressed and sweating, with out the mind racing all night. Its non-addicting and if I don't use it for a few days or lower the dose....I don't feel any worse for having changed things up. What do you have to lose? Try it, its inexpensive and give yourself some peace of mind.",10,27
Buspirone,"I live in an area where there are a lot of drug addicts so they didn't want to prescribe me a benzo. I took this because my PTSD had been so out of control. I was hopeful, but slowly realized my anxiety was 100 times worse on it. I kept taking it, thinking maybe it just wasn't kicking in yet. Next thing I knew I was scared to go to the store and I felt like people were watching me when I was alone in my house. I'd check and double check my windows were closed. My vision would vibrate and I felt dizzy and constantly dehydrated with a headache. It was absolutely terrible. I weaned myself off of it because I couldn't wait for my next psych appt. Now I'm back to just taking my lamictal and I feel loads better. Did nothing for me when it came to panic attacks. I need something I can take as needed",1,10
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 this drug does not work, end of story...",0,30
Buspirone,This drug has given me my life back. When I was first prescribed this medication it was the morning after an ER visit for a intense panic attack. I was in the midst of a nervous breakdown and struggling to even leave my home.  It's been roughly 2-3 months and I'm now able to function basically normally.  I don't believe any drug is a miracle worker but this one truly saved my life. I added it to Lexapro in which I've been on for years and added in a ton of therapy to help give me coping skills and tools to move forward. It is a class B medication so it's safe for nursing mom's as well which is wonderful. I suggest everyone dealing with  panic or anxiety give this drug a try.,9,24
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 Taken for: GAD, potential panic disorder Did not help me, Side effects - strong. Immediate light headedness, would need to lay down for 30 mins to an hour Slightly reduced in intensity but did not subside for me, even after 3 months. Did not effectively treat anxiety (GAD)",0,30
Buspirone,<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I have used Buspar for 10 yrs I take 60 mg by taking 20mg in morning 20mg in the afternoon and 20mg at bedtime. It helps me sleep and I have energy all day. My anxiety is never over a 1 on a scale of 1-10. I love this medication it goes well with my Viibryd 40mg.,0,44
Buspirone,"I have been taking buspirone for almost a year and a half. I was nervous to take anything stronger after coming off Ativan, and stayed just on buspirone for a year before deciding to add Pristiq. It is the perfect combo for me. Buspirone alone definitely took the edge off my daily anxiety but in high-stress situations it just wasn't enough. I was taking 25 mg daily. I now take 10mg daily, only at night, and 50 mg of Pristiq. I feel a lot more stable. My side effects are increased skin sensitivity and more vivid dreams. I did have brain fog after taking it during the day (which would last about a half-hour after I'd take it) but once I started taking Pristiq at night that stopped. I recommend trying it-- it's so safe and has so few side effects that it's an easy bet. The worst-case scenario is that it won't work, in my mind. It's also VERY cheap-- I paid less than $8 for a month's supply and I have awful insurance.",8,9
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I started the medication for my anxiety and bipolar. The first dose was not bad, but the second dose it took my 2 hours before I could get up, I was so dizzy and light headed. Made my panic attacks worse and felt so spaced out. I have a terrible headache that keeps coming and going.",0,23
Buspirone,"Life changed. Lexapro 20mg and buspirone 15mg/ twice a day for almost 2 years. I have felt a difference for a while now, but its finally completely working for me. I am the happiest I have been in a very long time. Im a better Mother, wife and person.  OCD could get better, but Im optimist that it will kick its butt too.",10,11
Buspirone,"After starting buspirone I didn't pay much attention to it. But I have noticed after I skipped several days of dosing meds that my thoughts was getting too intense about problem that I was going through - to the point where you get very angry, depressed, almost suicidal. That state felt for more than 20 hours until I realized that I had to take med again. After I took 10mg buspirone my brain started to not getting into much detail what I was thinking. Just looses a focus, sharpness of mind, like you are loosing extra short memory where all thoughts are starting. It will help in keeping your mind not getting to worry about something but costs you the price of memory and concentration.",8,13
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 My doctors were reluctant to put me on benzos because I had a brief history of drug use. They offered buspar as an alternative, it was one of if not the worst medication Ive ever taken. It felt like Benadryl that created the most uncomfortable physical sensation and the only thing I could do was lay down in bed and wait for it to wear off. Not recommended.",0,26
Buspirone,I have been on buspar for 2 years and it has made my life easier. Very good medication for severe anxiety out in crowded places or the city life. I am able to go out now and can handle doing things I could never do before due to my anxiety. Unfortunately it is starting to be a bit less effective than when I first got on it but it has made a big difference in my life. A wonderful medication!!,9,14
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 This medication has been a godsend for me. I'm unable to take SSRIs or SNRIs and had recently increased my dose of Wellbutrin XL (which had driven up my anxiety). The Buspar has significantly improved my anxiety symptoms and I find myself happier and more outgoing since starting it. It has mild sexual side effects on me but they are quite tolerable compared to what I have experienced in the past (if there's any chance a med like this will cause sexual side effects on somebody, I seem guaranteed to have them, no matter how small the chances). Buspar has also caused exertional headaches for me. I'm not a fan of needing to take it twice per day but it is a small tablet and easy enough to keep with me in a key fob.",0,19
Buspirone,Whenever I take it I feel like I was high I would be so completely out of it that if I wasn't somewhere where I could go lay down I would go crazy. It would make me so sleepy. When I was on it the next day I didn't remember what happened to myself after taking it or I wouldn't remember how I feel asleep or remembering walking in my house to go to bed.  Just a complete blackout. People would tell me and I wouldn't remember. It didn't do anything to help my anxiety all it did was get me so drugged up that it would knock me out into a deep sleep. Wake up feeling like I couldn't breathe,1,8
Buspirone,"I had the same experience as kat5528 on September 21, 2018. I wasn't myself at all on it. I would be mad at my kids for no reason and cry for no reason. It was nuts on this med. Hated it so did my kids.",1,7
Buspirone,"This medicine may work well for some people, but I wanted to share my experience because it wasnt pleasant.  After 2 weeks of taking buspirone, I thought I was going to die.  One morning at work I noticed heart palpitations, then got extremely dizzy and almost passed out three times before a coworker brought me to urgent care.  I stayed very dizzy with severe anxiety / panic attacks that lasted for a week.  I had to miss several days of work.  This was the first time I had experienced anything like this.",1,7
Buspirone,<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 This drug has been a miracle for me. I have all the symptoms of what one physician termed profound anxiety. NO DOCTOR until I found the right psychiatrist had even mentioned this drug. I've tried a lot of both tricyclic and SSRI and SNRI meds. All they did was give me side effects that made me feel worse. The benzodiazepines are addictive and not for a long term fix since their side effects and lasting effects are not good for the aging brain (I'm 75.),0,41
Buspirone,So far it hasn't done anything other than decrease my anxiety by about 10%. I'm still having almost constant anxiety mixed with common occurrences of panic attacks.,2,3
Buspirone,My Psychiatrist prescribed 10mg twice daily. I was so irritable on this medication. I was mad at my family for no reason. The littlest thing would make me so angry I would start to cry. I wasnt me on this medication plus it brought on more anxiety. I continued to take the medication for about 4 weeks to see if that side effect would subside but I couldnt take it any longer. I havent been able to find any other person with that side effect. This medication does work for a lot of people so dont get discouraged!,1,10
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I am extremely thankful this drug exists.  It has changed my life.  I suffer from PTSD from a previous illness and it has relieved my anxiety, 5 years of muscle tension and given me a clear mind.  Really mild side effects at 20MG a day.",0,34
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I actually felt a difference the second day but, it did take over a week to really work. I had severe anxiety from PTSD, after about 9 days on it....I feel so much better! Don't even need anti depressants now, honestly.",0,34

Buspirone,"I'm currently prescribed 15mg three times a day. My experience is that you can feel it's effects in 20 minutes, the effects for me are as follows: some sort of fuzzy sensation of waves being pulsed through my body every 10 seconds or so, I should mention the sensations of electricity waves would be at a pain level of 0, it's not painful as much as it is a bit annoying, the main annoyance being I've found that it makes standing up or moving quickly after sitting down make you feel out of breath, for example sometimes I'll have to brace myself and grab onto something as to not almost collapse. I'm 22. It has also very much so increased my overall libido . I don't notice any panic/anxiety/avoidance reduction effects, even at peak plasma concentration, I've come to the conclusion it doesn't seem to help my troublesome symptoms.",5,7
Buspirone,Didn't helped at all just made my anxiety worse  and gave me bad headaches and no energy only on it for three weeks,1,7
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 Did not really do anything except make me feel a bit dizzy, unfortunately.",0,13
Buspirone,"When my doctor talked with me about this medication I was a little  skeptical about the drug its self.  But before I buckled down and decided to go see a doctor, about 2-3 months prior Id be dealing with a very horrible life experience at the age of 23 years old I had just undergone a horrible very traumatic experience that involved a wreck in an semi truck, that knocked me out stone cold. I was knocked on the left side of my temple and received cuts in my head. I was having bad anxiety, panic attacks after the wreck, went to visit a doctor who prescribes this medication Busiprone I gave it a chance tried it, stayed on the prescription a little over a year. It was definitely helping me. I unfortunately couldnt get the next refill of it. There are days I feel as if I know it would help me greatly now and I could really use it today and there are days I know it would help me,  100%  .",10,6
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I was first prescribed Buspar a few years ago when my anxiety was much, much worse and neither my doctor nor I wanted me to start taking benzos. About a year into it I stopped taking it because it was making me a little too relaxed during the day, but I started it again last fall at a lower dose and I've only had positive experiences with it since. I will say it's probably more for milder GAD. I am now dealing with some pretty fresh PTSD after a violent assault a couple years ago and I've found the combination of Buspar and Lamictal to be perfect for this. I have a very high tolerance so I can't speak to any of the negative side effects, but I can say that this is milder than most but still effective enough to continue taking.",0,20

Buspirone,"I'm supposed to take 5mg twice a day but I wanted to start with just 5 mg once a day to see if there were any side effects and I must admit there are with only 1 dose a day so I'm definitely apprehensive about taking it twice a day.

Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I've always had crippling anxiety. This medication relieves me from my anxiety without taking a scheduled medication (Xanax, Valium, Ativan, etc) and coming up in a drug screen. This medication hasn't taken my anxiety totally away (and everyone has a normal amount of anxiety), but it has diminished significantly.

At this point in time I'm taking 30 mg 3 times a day of buspar with about .50 mg of xanax 4 times a day. It is a bit more stable but my tics are coming back and so are my triggers for the asperger's.

I am now feeling very anxious on a daily basis. I feel unbalanced and unsteady.  My blood pressure is good and no signs of any other medical issues. I feel dizziness daily. Im wondering if anyone else has had these experiences on buspirone? My doctor ordered a carotid ultrasound and CT scan.  She never suggested that it could possibly be the buspirone.  I called the pharmacist today and they said busiprone can be stopped or taper taking my dose every other day.  Im sick of feeling anxious, dizzy, and unsteady.

To this day, I still have this sporadic and strange eye pressure that comes after I take a pill, but it's usually gone within 15 minutes.  BuSpar helped me through what otherwise would have probably been an extremely stressful divorce. The number of thoughts of imagined scenarios that rarely happen have been eliminated to almost zero. I'm also much more social and as such, confident. It hasn't helped with some things like adrenaline and subsequent anxiety from things like public speaking, but that's why there's Xanax. It's not a cure all, but it's still 10/10 if you have general anxiety.",0,36

Buspirone,I have started this medication generic from manufacturer Mylan and had bad reactions by 10 fold but I had stuck it out hoping it would work.  Then I had received my next  prescription from a different maker - came in a bar form and to my surprise this was a total different feel of medication. How is this possible? More of a sedative feeling instead of such anxiety over the top which worried me so much that I decide I have to stop this medication  and ween off.  It's disturbing to think you want to get better but how can you if the generics you are prescribed are different from each other.  I go through Kaiser and so far disappointed with how things are all handled. Stick with one manufacturer not multiple different manufacturers of a medication as they are different...,1,9

But since being off the medicine my heart rate has been fine. Not over 100 bpm. Anyways took 2.5 mg of buspar last night and my heart rate has been under control. I just want to cry cause I haven't seen my heart normal without being on a heart medicine even then it didn't really help much. I guess I found my miracle drug and my heart rate was due to anxiety since doctors give me high anxiety and panic,0,33

But overall the buspar makes me feel good and I don't feel the despair and tension like I was going to explode.

Doc then put me on 150mg of Wellbutrin which takes 4-6 wks to kick in. During that time (1st 4 wks) I was VERY depressed &amp; anxiety &amp; panic attacks were very bad (had my worst panic attack ever), but then she upped my Buspar to 25mg which helped calm down the anxiety and panic attacks. 4 wks after starting Wellbutrin she upped that to 300mg. In a week depression disappeared &amp; anxiety calmed down and its been 4 wks since.

I also didn't like how the anxiety would start coming back when the medicine was wearing off.  I would consider taking this again in the future because unlike SSRI's, there are no sexual side effects and it is safe to take during pregnancy. I do recommend this medication if you don't mind taking it multiple times per day and can accept that you may occasionally feel mild dizziness for a short period of time after taking a dose.",8,4

I do feel less anxiety (constant worry, easily irritated), but feel it come back about 5 hours later. It has taken the edge off of social anxiety but has taken about 2 months to get there. It is a mild anti anxiety med. It doesn't make you feel drugged or spaced out. It helps to give you the ability to stop the anxious thoughts but doesn't seem to do it all for you. I have ADD as well and take Wellbutrin along with Buspar. I have taken Lexapro and although it does wonders for anxiety it also caused me to feel a bit manic over time. Lexapro also wiped out my memory. I have a grandson now and I want to remember and be at my best for him.",0,30

I began to fear nights, because they occurred at night, preventing me from properly sleep. I went two months without seeking medical help, until I did. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. They prescribed me BuSpar/Busporine; I've been on it for a little over a month now (7.5m.g. twice a day) and OH MY GOSH, it saved my life.

That night I came home after working two 12 hour shifts back to back,  and I had the worst insomnia of my life. I have NEVER EVER had trouble sleeping after my twelve hour shifts. I was up for almost 24 hours it was so bad and I was absolutely exhausted and miserable. Needless to say, I deemed the insomnia not worth taking this drug.",3,3

Years ago I was on Ativan and it was a miracle drug for me. I would like to stop the buspirone and just take the Ativan as needed.

Dr. put me on Buspar 10mg twice a day.  I was also on Prozac 20 mg once a day and Clonopin 0.5mg once at night for years and felt just fine.  The Buspar made me spacey and did not help the anxiety.  They reduced it to 5mg twice a day.  Still a little spacey and did not help anxiety.  Upped my Clonopin to an extra 0.5mg in morning and 0.25mg in afternoon.  Buspar is not helping.  Going to ask my doctor to change to something else.  Been on it almost a couple of months.  Any help anyone can give me?  Thanks so much.

Giving it 3 stars because it didn't hurt me except for the tired loopy feeling, and I can't orgasm easily at all. Also my appetite is gone so I've lost some weight, which is nice except having no appetite meant I wasn't taking in enough calories so I was even more tired.

Again I split 7.5 in half so I'm taking 3 times a day for a total of 11.25 mg a day total current dosage last (6) months Pros: I did start to feel less anxious, I didn't like overreact to stress like I used to.

I had hope my body would get used to it and the dizziness would eventually end. That never happened. I gave it a full year (I know now how ridiculous that was). During this time period I also had really negative thoughts that I absolutely believe were linked to the medication.

That medication made me feel very tingly, I felt like a rubberband that was stretched pulled, this was a daily feeling, it was scary.   I also had feelings of not being able to control myself. For example when washing dishes I felt that I was out of control. So I hurried and washed dishes.  I took this medication for about 2 months, I stopped taking it. I will never again take it again.  What did help me with 95% of my anxiety attacks was to stay away from sugar and flour products. Now I rarely have anxiety attacks. More Protein!",0,32

Buspirone,I've been taking buspar in differing doses on and off for over a year. I was prescribed it and 0.5mg xanax for severe anxiety and panic attacks. Taken together it was helping only couldn't function or take care of my daughter while taking both. Since moving to another state I stopped taking the xanax and then got pregnant so can't take it anyways. My anxiety and panic issues got better after moving to the new state. But getting pregnant again my anxiety came back . I was started on a slightly lower dose then was taking before and it was too much for me so my ob and I decided on a lower dose but I upped it due to not being helpful I will be upping again and hopefully it helps... Its a good medication if the right dose.,8,4

I started having bad anxiety and panic attacks. So my family Dr. put me on buspar and zoloft for the duration of being in a cast. So far it hasn't seemed to help very much, 7.5 mg twice daily.

Buspirone was my last resort. It's been about 4 weeks and what a difference. I'm enjoying my life with my kids, family, and friends again. I used to go everywhere with no problems but the past 7 months I could barely leave my house. I shut down completely. Buspirone is changing me back to the person I was. My anger has diminished.

Same pattern occurred.... within 3 days I was feeling better. In fact, had the best day in a while. It might just be a coincidence and therapy might be helping in conjunction with, but I notice Buspar does help with my extreme anxiety, but only when I went above 5 mg.

I started out at 10 mg buspar once a day and then after a week increased to 10 twice a day . The first week, I won't lie, was a doozy. My psych said that her patients either love it or hate it and it's pretty much 50/50 with little gray area. But since it's inexpensive, been around for a while, and is pretty safe, she likes that to be the first option when dealing with GAD. Fair. The first week, I was really, really dizzy. Felt a bit fuzzy in the head. kind of jumpy. I had to pull over while driving and sit down for a bit. BUT after about two weeks. Whoah. My life is changed. I'm no longer so anxious!!",0,86
Buspirone,"This medication can be effective when used correctly. It has to be taken every day around the same time, much like the way an antidepressant works. It takes a few weeks to become effective. It is not to be taken as needed, as someone mentioned. You have to keep a steady dose of it in your system. For me, it works much better at low doses, best benefit with least side effects, when taken this way.",8,19

I was on a very light dose 2.5mg three times a day.  Maybe I did not take enough. So he gave me Lexapro, which I have not started, I am holding out, when I get anxious I take a half of a .25 xanax and it keeps the anxiety away.

Buspirone,Not sure about this one yet. I have been on it for only five days now and it's a roller coaster ride. Sometimes I feel okay and other times I feel like I'm going crazy. My doctor prescribed me to take 15mg twice daily which I think was way too much to start out with. I literally felt like I was going to lose my mind because of the thoughts I was having. I also think this has increased my depression and feeling of isolation. I know that this medication takes time to work in your system and that it can make symptoms worse while it is working so I'm going to try and ride it out a little longer.

My Dr. told me that I can increase the dosage, since in taking so little it doesn't rid me of anxiety completely (no med can). But I noticed that when I upped my dose my appetite came back more than I would have liked. Essentially, I think it works to strengthen my SSRI (sertraline); and I did have dizziness when I first started and felt pretty bad, but that's common for anti-anxieties and usually goes away as your body gets used to it.

I also have a non addicting personality but I am dependent on the medication ill admit. i feel that most of you should have started taking the buspar and took the benzo as well because you might be feeling the anxiety more because of that not the new medication.

Buspirone,I take it when I have an Anxiety - feel relief in about 30min. Also I take it before bedtime and I find it a very good sleeping pill. If you have insomnia- take 7.5 Remeron. It will do good! I promise,6,9
Buspirone,I began taking buspirone 10mg 3 times per day and had it increased to 20mg 3 times per day. Buspirone only made my anxiety worse and gave me panic attacks daily. I am also taking fluoxetine and ziprasidone. Once I stopped taking buspirone the panic attacks stopped. This medicine didn't work for me.,1,6

I sure hope so!",2,11
Buspirone,<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 Needed something for severe anxiety and this worked really well at first. I was amazed at how well it worked for the first month and then it all went downhill from there which is strange because I have read it takes a month to work in some people. Was taking 2 doses a day and it worked great but it was short lived. Tried 3 doses a day and that only made it worse. Just felt horrible on it after a couple of months. Maybe it will  work for you but it was not for me,0,41

I started with half a pill then after a week the whole pill 2x daily.  I since then I decreased my dose to half. Now I'm off completely.  All of the side effects have stopped almost immediately.  No brain zaps, irritability decreased slowly, and water retention stopped.  This pill didn't do anything except all of the bad.

He agreed it was safe to take with my other medications (quite a few that I take for chronic pain and anxiety) but this medication, that is the ONLY FDA approved medication for anxiety that is NOT addictive, or so he says, actually has made me smile and made my general social and overall anxiety go away.

I understand the risk with taking benzos but it the only thing that has ever helped me. I would recomend never taking buspar.",0,36
Buspirone,"I started buspirone last week. Prescribed to take one 7.5mg twice a day. I'm not big on pill taking so with my doctors consent have only taken them when needed.  The first day was... a unique one. I was extremely lightheaded and dizzy. As if the entire room was spilling but at the same time I had this unbelievable sense of relief from my anxiety. There are no words for the sense of relief and calm that i felt. With each day I've taken them the dizzy spell has gotten weaker and weaker. I do have a dull headache afterwards but it passes with time and Tylenol. I'm hoping that goes away as well. But if I have to choose between minor dizziness, and a slight headache over the chest pounding, agonizingly severe panic attack... I choose the buspirone",8,27
Buspirone,"My first ever medication I tried for anxiety and with unfavorable results unfortunately. Taking it the first week I felt slightly less anxious and ready to move. After this though, I started to can a terrible dizziness that would keep me locked in my bed for hours until it subsides.

Had to come off of it after less than a month of feeling like I was on a horrible plane ride.",5,5

Buspirone,"Buspirone has improved my life!  Initial response was unpleasant.  Prescribed 10mg 1/2-1 pill every 6-8 hrs. First dose felt odd, not myself, jittery, detached.  Others positive reviews prompted me to started w/only 1/4 pill before a nap then 1/2 before bed. Being asleep made a difference, woke up refreshed, alert, at ease. Then took 1 pill 3 x day.  Day 5 the constant ringing in my ears from tinnitus was less noticeable and my stress level better.  After a month I feel so much happier!  Positive, alert, more in control. Negatives: vivid dreams.  Symptoms of my autoimmune disorder are improved, it appears Buspirone helps in more ways than is listed and has turned out to be the single most effective med I take. Wish I had it years ago!",10,28
Buspirone,I started on 5mg twice a day for the first month and now am on 10mg twice a day for 2-3 weeks now.  It made me really dizzy after taking it and it still does but I just make sure to take it when I'm sitting down for awhile. I did not really think it was working at all because I was getting anxious constantly still.  However this last week I have had zero anxiety.  In fact I feel so weird not worrying all the time. But I am happy because it's actually working.  I am glad I stuck it out. I recommend staying on it for 6-8 weeks before deciding it does not work. Yes there are some side effects but nothing like SSRIs that I had taken in past.,9,17
Buspirone,Why is everyone on such extremely low doses of Buspar??  I've been taking it for approx  3 years for anxiety at a prescribed dose of 30 mgs every 4 - 6 hours for a total not to exceed 150mgs daily.  The half life of Buspar is only 2-3 hours so it makes absolutely  no sense to me that someone would only be taking one dose per day unless they're only wanting to curb their anxiety symptoms for 4-6 hours per day.... . .,7,24
Buspirone,"I started this for my moderate anxiety and the side effects were so terrible I had to stop. Felt like my head wasn't attached to my body, really dizzy and therefore nauseous too. I took it with food and within 15 minutes every time I feel like this. Made me vomit the first time because I was so dizzy.  I'm going back tomorrow and refuse to take it anymore. I couldn't feel any positive effects because I was too busy trying to stand straight",1,6
Buspirone,"Not good experience AT ALL. I Have anxiety and depression - usually managable with 20mg paroxetine but exacerbated by stress at work- also diagnosed with C-PTSD. Take diazepam as and when to deal with most severe panic attacks. Psychiatrist assured me I could still take diazepam with this drug. After 1st dose I felt drowsy, spaced out and dizzy with heavy legs. I actually fell down a small flight of stairs in my house and later on in the day slipped on the main staircase. Decided to persevere and take another in the evening. Woke up feeling like a zombie, could hardly stay awake, headache and on edge. Discontinued. That night, woke up TERRIFIED and spent next day (today) either having intense panic attacks or wanting to commit suicide",1,9
Buspirone,"Started taking this medication for GAO. I had never taken any medication regularly before. I got diagnosed with GAO at 31. Started on a low dose 5mg per day and over the course of a month it got bumped up to 15 mg twice a day. This drug didn't give me immediate relief. It took six weeks but all of the symptoms of my GAO have disappeared. I am finally reaping the rewards of the full clinical effect, I feel like myself again! Initially I had side effects like dizzyness, ringing in my ears and nausea but over time they have lessened. I still don't feel too hot for the first hour after I take it but after that hour, I'm golden. I had to be patient and just deal with my GAO, which sucked.  My take: The juice is worth the squeeze",9,22

I'm also on neurontin for anxiety, lexapro for anxiety and depression. I have to say, this is the best I've felt in over 10 years. this buspar works for me, amazing drug.",0,71
Buspirone,"My GP prescribed this at 10mg up to 3x a day but only as needed. As in when I would start feeling an overwhelming foreshadowing to an anxiety attack. Taken as such, this medication did nothing for me. I only got like a rush of dizziness shortly after taking. So I stopped. A couple of months later I went to visit my psychiatrist on my regular visit and I explained the buspar and dosage I was told. She absolutely disagreed with my GP's dosage and informed me I should take this drug consistently 3x a day and not just as needed since this needs to build in your system to be effective. I can't say if this is AS effective for me yet as I was misinformed on dosage from my 1st doc but it's starting to work better than only taking as needed.",5,7
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I tried buspar in addition to 200mg of zoloft. it was meant to enhance the zoloft. Unfortunately , it didn't work for me. I was on it for about 5 months, and during that time i kept having on and off discomfort , like my heart was beating harder,my stomach was always really bloated, my body heat would rise and I'd have a hard time cooling down. The symptoms were so mild I didn't really pay much attention to it, but after a while i got tired of the negative side effects and decided to call it quits. Almost immediately after i stopped taking the medication, all of those negative symptoms went away so I definitely know it was the buspar. if anyone has similar side effects, just stop the medication after two weeks max, its not worth it.",0,29
Buspirone,I finally went up to 30 milligrams a day. It helped tremendously with my anxiety. I went off after I lost my insurance and had no withdrawals like I did with benzodiazepines.,10,13

Buspirone,"Like you, I came to this website in a desperate attempt to find any medication thst would help alleviate the mental and physical pain that I was experiencing. I have tried a couple of different SSRI medications in the past at different times but eventually discontinued them after a couple of months due to their limited effectiveness in reducing my anxiety and the side effects they caused (headache, sense of detachment, inability to gain erection or orgasm, nausea). Buspirone has been very helpful at reducing my anxiety and improving my quality of life. I am currently in week 5 of my treatment of 22.5mg per day. I take 7.5mg at 8:00, 12:30, and 5:00.  Only side effect that I experience is dizziness 15 minutes after taking.",8,18

I was itchy all over but no rashes and had an awful headache that tramadol couldn't even touch!!! Went to wedding and spent most of the time in the bathroom just to avoid people. Personally if a GP suggests this drug to you I would say no, GOD NO! But this only from my own experience. I'm now on Prozac and diazepam because it messed me up so much.

Buspirone,"I suffer from depression, anxiety and panic attacks. I take Remeron for depression and Buspirone 15mg twice daily. I was on Xanax for 6 months but my doctor switched me to this because i will just continually need to be bumped up on the Xanax and it's not that effective in the long run, which is true. .5mgs do nothing for me anymore when they are supposed to suppress a panic attack and I really need them. The Buspirone puts up this big dam to hold back the river of emotions I have. I feel like I have emotions of steel compared to crying all the time. Part of my anxiety is racing thoughts. This helps me FOCUS. I haven't been this productive in 10 years. However this does NOTHING for panic attacks.",8,16

Buspirone,"This medication did nothing....absolutely NOTHING for me, if fact, there were days when I actually felt like the world was crashing down on me for absolutely no reason, so I have a suspicion that it made my anxiety actually worse. I had pretty damn severe anxiety to start with, but like I said there were days when I was crying and hyperventilating when there wasnt even anything going on. The only good news is it didnt give me any other side effects...besides the increased anxiety. I didnt get the dizziness or fatigue that I was warned about, I'm so happy it didnt make me nauseous at all, which I was really worried about (one of my phobias is vomiting so...yea). Make sure you take this med at the same times each day, I made that mistake.",2,5

I suffer from severe degenerative arthritis as well as a few other medical concerns that placed me on Tramadol &amp; Flexeril to try to manage my pain. When I asked for an anxiety medication back (they took me off 7 months ago), she prescribed Buspirone 7.5 BID PRN.

Buspirone,For GAD I take 10mg once a day in the afternoon currently.  I've been on this dose for approx 2 months and the only side effect is bad lightheaded slightly dizzy feeling approx 30 minutes after taking it which lasts for 30min to 1 hour.  I was hoping it would go away after taking it for awhile but the dizziness comes on like clockwork after taking it.  It greatly helps my anxiety in the evening after taking it but my anxiety returns mid morning.  I'm not sure I could take a morning dose because of the side effect of being light headed for awhile.  If I could get past the dizziness this medication causes and get to a 10mg 2x a day I think it would greatly improve my GAD 24x7.,8,11
Buspirone,"My body is hyper sensitive to all medicines. I've had horrible experiences with all SSRI's. I take 15mg of buspar. I take all 3 pills at once before sleep. It helps calm my body down.

Because of the severity of my anxiety I do take other things to help level me out. I'm on a low dose of xanex (which I regret, I can't get off without crazy withdrawal symptoms.)

So I went and they gave me Ambien, which I do well with and Buspirone. I took it (only 5mg) today at 2pm. 30 mins later I started feeling very off, like my anxiety was getting worse every minute.

I occasionally still had panic attacks that would eventually pass with drinking a bunch of water and sometimes taking an extra helper dose. Recently switched to 3x a day still at 10mg since the med doesn't seem to last as long as it used to. Still occasionally take a helper dose to fall asleep.

I've noticed tingly or itchy sensation in hands, feet, arms (different times). Also more headaches than before I started buspar. LightheadedNess even though I've felt that way before taking it. Upset stomach, or nausea. Sharp sensation in different places. Oh yes and definitely noticed wierd dreams.

Buspirone,"I've been on this for two weeks. I went to my doctor because I was experiencing anxiety and worry way to often, for too long. I tried to manage it on my own, but the feelings persisted. I made an appointment for a psych, but the wait was three months. I assumed I had to go to a psych for medication management but a friend told me my doctor could prescribe something.  My doctor gave me a script for 7.5 mg twice a day. Soon after, the constant knot in my stomach and consistent worry subsided. I see that people say it takes a while for this to work, but I feel like I had pretty quick results. I have had no side effects on this med thus far.",8,34

I do feel hot and a little shaky about 20 minutes after I take it but it don't last very long, maybe 30 minutes. I'm also losing some much needed weight. Probably because I'm not eating at night since I'm actually sleeping through the night for the first time in my life! This stuff changed my life for the better!",0,126

Within 20 minutes or so after taking  (with food), my head starts whooshing and I'm very dizzy (almost feel drunk/high). It lasts about an hour then I feel better. Is this someone else has experienced? Is it something that will go away? Is the side effect an allergy to the drug? Basically, I'm taking to get rid of anxiety/ panic attacks and help me to need less xanax. With these side effects I'll need MORE xanax!! Lol",0,26
Buspirone,<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I have been taking buspar for 4 months now and it has helped pretty well for my anxiety. I take 3 10mg a day. I mostly like it because it helps with the extra anxiety and slight depression i get from the come down off of my adderall i take for adhd every day too. The only side effects I've had from the buspar has been nausea but as long as i eat a little bit of food whenever i take them it subsides that pretty well so i would recommend it to anyone with the same situation.,0,73
Buspirone,"I just started taking this medication a few days ago, I will write an update later as I give it more time. Thus far my side effects have been a slight numbing of my mouth, I am extremely sensitive to medication and this has happened with other meds I have taken so I am not alarmed by this. I am taking it with food and I do feel a bit of slight nausea and tiredness about an hour after taking it, I also feel a bit spaced but I am hoping these will subside over time. It isn't anything unmanageable at this time, I am on a very low dose 2.5 mg BID, it isn't what the doctor prescribed but after talking with my pharmacist about my sensitivity to meds he said I could build up to the dose. I was prescribed 5 mg BID to increase if needed.",0,4

My social anxiety, much improved. It's very subtle, but after sticking with it, I can look back and I see that it changed my life. It does make me sleepy, in a walking around functioning while yawning kind of way and I get a lot of headaches. The good definitely outweighs The bad.

I just want to be happy and be able to go run my errands. Buspirone didn't even touch my anxiety. I became very angry and irritable and it's starting fights between me and my girlfriend. She had to leave me by myself today because my anger was stressing her out. I've developed an I don't care attitude and it has freaked me out. I'm done taking this drug.

I used to take four immodium a day to control the stomach issues.  Now, I rarely take it.  Buspirone also had a very gradual effect...things kept getting better. I had to recently reduce the dose a bit as I'd get dizzy after taking it but it still works. Doctors had insisted that I try antidepressants first.  The side effects (several brands and low doses) were awful and the medications didn't help.",10,19

Infrequently I will get dizzy and nauseated for about 40 minutes after taking depending on how much caffeine I have had or how long after a meal I wait to take it.  I noticed results after the first few doses, though I was warned that it may take longer. My mood has noticeably improved as well as my ability to handle day-to-day tasks like talking on the phone. I still have situational based anxiety, but that is more manageable than general anxiety. I have noticed that if I am a few hours late for a dose I get irritable for the next few doses.",8,14

I'm still having attacks off and on but I'm going to stick with this and give it some more time.

I started with 1 5mg every 24 hours and I can tell a difference , I am calm and I sleep better .

Buspirone,"I recently started to use this drug, as I was diagnosed with a chronic illness and realized much of my pain was coming from anxiety. I have only been on it for a week, but I love it! I felt the effects the first day I took it. My doctor also told me that it is one of the safest out there and that he rarely even recommends benzos anymore due to this drug. I did get a little dizzy at first, so I stared taking halves. Anxiety was beginning to take over my life, I was anxious about anxiety. I can say that this stuff actually works!!!!",10,42

With the busar I am more patient, not explosive or impulsive. Also, I used to have so many negative or catastrophic as automatic thoughts all the time. On Buspar I rarely have them.

Buspirone,"I've recently been stricken with anxiety, starting in January, after some hard events. I went from an excitable, coffee loving, caffeine addict, to a nervous wreck. I can't have more than 20mg of caffeine without having a severe panic attack...it's nuts..I'm a freaking barista. With Buspirone, I'm heart palpitation, and chest pain free. When it first kicked in, I immediately felt physically lighter. It was amazing! And I realized, that's exactly when the medicine kicked in for the first time. Gonna stick with it to see if I can eventually have caffeine again and be way less nervous over all!",9,37
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 Buspar lifted the anxiety ever so gently. I take 3 10 mg tablets per day and it's only $6 per month when prescribed that way. 2 15mg pills a day was $45. As if the relief from anxiety wasn't wonderful enough, after the first 3 years I went from getting plastered with viruses, to just 1 or 2  a year.  Think about it...anxiety causes the brain to send out massive amounts of cortisol and adrenaline, which seriously compromises your immune system. Less cortisol &amp; adrenaline equals a stronger immune system.  Then there's the enhanced sexual experience for a percentage of us...and that's a little personal, but very appreciated!",0,144
Buspirone,"I'm not one to turn to medication for help, but when I got to the point where anxiety was eating me from the inside out I knew I could use help. I am taking Vyvanse 20 for my A.D.D and was prescribed 5mg of Buspar twice a day. I'm very sensitive to medication so I wanted to start off low and I've read many people feel like it's a sugar pill because they feel nothing. I can tell you that this is not like Xanax. Usually around 6pm I start feeling anxious on everything that is to come. Cooking, college homework, my children, appointments and even taking showers gave me anxiety because I knew it needed to be done and I felt I didn't have enough time. It's an awful nauseating feeling for those of you who suffer from it. I felt 100% better...",9,29
Buspirone,"Buspirone acts on a very specific neuronal receptor which is why people experience such a diverse set of reactions.  Do not be afraid to work with the dosage.  I take 2mg twice a day.  that's it.  that's all I need.  if it helps your anxiety but gives bad side effects just lower the dose! I think for those of us that buspar helps, it does make us lose our sparkle.  we aren't anxious as much but get a little i don't care zombie going on now I am trying to find a supplement or Rx that can add that bit of sparkle buspar takes away.  I am allergic to SSRI, SSNRI, DNRI, and many others. but overall buspar is worth a try.  anything from 1 mg to 50 mg might be your magic bullet.  don't be afraid to try.  just start low.",7,35
Buspirone,"I have had anxiety all my life, my mom will tell you since I was 4 years old lol. I went on prescription meds when I was 18. Started with Lexapro, it stopped working. Switched to Prozac, that stopped working. Switched to another SSRI, so on and so forth for years. I have always disliked meds like Xanax, due to how my body tolerated the drug. So I declined taking anything in that drug class or even close to it. I am not a depressed person, I have been diagnosed with GAD for the past 15 years. I have to say, I feel such a change after 3 weeks on no meds to clear my system and now being on Buspar 10mg BID for the past week. My head feels clear, sex drive is back and off the charts, my memory is back. I will keep updating but so far I'm happy!",8,39

Originally prescribed Cymbalta (Duloxetine) and Xanax (as needed) but I did not like the side effects of those drugs. After a painful withdrawal from Duloxotine, my physician placed me on Buspar 5mg 3x daily, later it was increased to 10mg 3x daily. Doctor claimed there was no addictive nature to the drug and discontinuing use would have no side effects either. What a difference!. Very little, if any, anxiety. Better mood, sleep and none of the negative side effects I had previously. Highly recommend.",10,37
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I initially was prescribed this a few months ago at 10 mg 3xd, but it made me headachy and almost made my anxiety worse, so I quit taking it.

Then had panic attack for the first time. Turns out I'm addicted to the ativan. My doctor gave me .5 ativan didn't stop the attacks and couldn't function right. I had to take a full 1 mg to function. When ever I don't take it I get a panic attack. Well my PcP gave me buspar and been doing better. I been on it two days he wants me to take 15 mg four times a day but that's too much I take 7.5 and feel normal. Taking a full 15 mg is a no no. But at the right dosage it works. Hopefully soon to kick the ativan out. Of missed worked because of this ativan problem. I don't suggest taking any benzodiazepines.,0,62
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I began taking buspar about six weeks ago. I am not a fan of benzos because they are addictive, I prefer to function with a clear head rather than popping a pill that sedates me so badly that maybe I'm not feeling my anxiety, but I'm also not living my life or doing much else either. Buspar has changed my life, I had completely forgotten what it was like to have a quiet mind until now. My obsessive thoughts subsided, I can leave my house without fear, I can speak to my friends and to strangers without profusely sweating and trembling, and I can drive again now that I'm not so easily stimulated. It takes a few weeks to feel the full effect, so hang in there if you just began.",0,236
Buspirone,"I take this for anxiety, it seems like it calms. Hard to tell. I had to switch the dosage. In the beginning taking 10mg was too much and it gave me a headache, so Doc said to break it in half and take it twice a day. The problem with that is, it's hard to tell now if it's working and I sometimes forget to take the other half. When I would take the whole 10mg I could tell the difference within a few minutes. Maybe I will try to take a 10mg again to see if I still get the headache since it's been over a month now. *sighs*  finding the right medication is not easy!",7,15

The zaps went away after a few days, but I still got nauseous for a while after taking it. Since my anxiety didn't improve, combined with the nausea not going away, I was taken off it. I'd say give it a try if your doc recommends it - I see lots of positive reviews and it's not addictive.  I now take 10mg Lexapro and 5 mg Valium (as needed).

I could feel the chemicals in my brain changing and suppressing the anxiety and it was a relief!

Well maybe that's because it actually works and isn't that the point of taking a medication for an ailment? I worry if I change doctors I'll appear to be a pill seeker or some bad news person.

I take one 7.5mg tablet 3x a day for a total of 22.5mg per day. I had to start with half a tablet twice a day and titrate up to where I am now, because at first they felt like they made my adrenaline and heart race, even though they are supposed to do the opposite of that. I don't feel any side effects, except I do sweat a little more than I used to (which was a lot in the first place), and I feel less sharp mentally. But neither of these are to the point they really bother me, and they definitely don't outweigh the benefits I am receiving from the medication. I recommend this medicine highly.",8,21

I've always been anxious, but things got much worse when I tried different stimulants for my ADHD. Even with a low dose of lexapro, I started to have dramatic panic attacks. It was awful. I went off both with the help of Ativan, but I didn't want to become dependent on the benzo, so I took them as infrequently as possible (1/2 or 1 per day).

Had some break through anxiety with stress from home accompanied by terrorism being covered by news ,doctor bumped me up to 10mg. This time no side effects , worked great. Right now I'm experiencing dizziness again months later, my feeling is I need to go back down to 5mg because it's now to much for my body.

My anxiety is decreased , but I'm in a cranky mood but that could be due to withdrawals from lorazepam. I totally agree with the fact that a negative review of this product could keep people that desperately need it to not even try it.

Since upped to 60mg a day, along with my celexa, the Buspar has definitely done it's job and prevents any general feelings of anxiety from blowing into full anxiety attacks. I can definately feel a negative difference when I've missed a day.  My only concern is that about 20 minutes after I take my morning dose of Buspar, I usually get a dizzy, weak, passout feeling that persists for about a half hour.

I gotta admit that I've been curious myself, and they don't seem to give me side effects of any kind, so I just keep taking them.  I'm probably gonna stop and just stick to the venlafaxine because it seems to be starting to kick in now at 300mg.

If I take one due to an anxiety attack, about an hour later I am crying and talking about how much I hate myself, then about 30 minutes after that stops, I get extremely irritable and everything makes me mad.

I know the doctor prescribed one dosage but if you continue to feel sick after a few days just lower your dose and start from there. You're going to feel weird for the first few days anyways as your body adjusts. The Meds work great.

The only problem was I felt a little dizzy after the first 10 min of taking it but then I was fine and I would go about my regular day and I felt amazing. I took this pill everyday for about 4 days and felt fine but then one day after I took it, I was so dizzy, I could barely stand up and then I felt nauseous all day long. It was not fun.

Buspirone,<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I was prescribed benzodiazepine for my post traumatic stress disorder induced anxiety. The benzos worked great for me but after admitting myself into a rehab program for substance abuse I was told I could no longer take the benzos as there is high risk for abuse and addiction (even though this wasn't the medicine I was abusing). After a number of panic attacks I sought help from the doctor for a non-addictive alternative. They gave me Buspar 10mg 3x a day. This improved my anxiety but I still had days that were debilitating. I saw the doctor again and he upped the does to 15mg 3x a day and I have been completely anxiety free since. Make sure you have the proper dosage before claiming this doesn't work. And the side effects like dizziness are easily countered with a good meal.,0,250

Generalized Anxiety Disorder is a terrible thing to TRY and live with, Buspar is the answer. I had tried lots of natural remedies, like 5HTP and many others. The natural supplements had far more side effects than Buspar! I hate taking medication, but I'm not sure how I'd get along without it.  Buspar has changed my life.

Anyway as for Buspirone - took between 10 mg and 15 mg 2x day for nearly a whole month and it did virtually nothing for my anxiety!

It seems to be working already, I'm not grinding my teeth all day, so my jaw no longer hurts and I'm able to focus a bit better.  I like it way better than clonazapam or any benzo I've been given.

Once I took a dose it took effect in half-hour. It does well on it's own to control the anxiety. I took a couple stars off because the side effects are true to the label. They aren't so severe after years of taking it, but the dizziness is strong. I feel like my body will just fall one way or the other, and it's hard to gather strength.

I was dizzy and unable to think straight. I was useless and confused at work, making my anxiety worse. Once I cut down to 2.5mg at bedtime, it was perfect for me. The ability to sleep well helped me to make better food choice, exercise more, and think more clearly.

It calms me down and makes me think more rationally rather than experiencing constant worry and fear. I feel more free and open to life. Side effects I've experienced include dizziness, hot flashes and extreme hunger for about an hour after taking it.

It is a night/day type difference. I interact with strangers, made new friends, can focus on my work and school without being bogged down by troublesome worry, and smile so much more.

Give this medication time and try increased dosages with your doctor's approval.

I finally found a doctor to give me klonopin as needed and it has been a Godsend. There should not be shame and stigma attached to controlled substances.

Dosage has been adjusted throughout the years. I am told 60mgs a day is the maximum dose. I am currently on 15mgs 3 times per day.  It took a good two weeks to get into my system, and I remember thinking it wasn't working at first.  It's no Xanax, but it has helped me much more then Paxil and Lexapro did.  This works well for me, and I have no issues taking it for the rest of my life.  I do get some increased hunger and minor dizziness after each dose for about 15 minutes, but that beats being anxious and worrying all the time.  It is also pretty cheap.",0,198

I have been told that Buspar takes a while to start working but after a few days of 10 mg/day I can tell a difference in my attitude.  My neuro in FL that handles my SCA said to take this because it has helped with balance issues that SCA patients have. Haven't noticed yet but will see.  I do deal with some dizziness in the morning after taking it but that's it.  I love it so far.  Thanks everyone.,8,33

Ihave obsessive compulsive disorder with high blood pressure so when major event occur in my life, my mind runs 80 miles an hour trying to plan and manage everything down to the last detail.  Then, I find myself overwhelmed and I have anxiety attacks simply because I can't do it all by myself!

My main side effects so far would be light-headedness and sleepiness, which is way better than anxiety attacks!",10,51

I'm noticing the irritability again. I've had headaches every day. The dizziness shortly after taking medicine doesn't bother me it goes away after a few minutes. And I like that I feel functional and not like a robot. It definitely works, but maybe I need a higher dose.",8,15

It also makes me dizzy if I take it differently than normal (with food as opposed to without, vice versa).

I have previously tried selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), benzodiazepines, as well as meditation, exercise, healthy eating, and CBT.  All the non-drug options were helpful but not sufficient. SSRIs were not very effective in my case and I had various side effects.  Benzodiazepines worked brilliantly and helped me through some stressful months of training but led to pharmacological tolerance and dependence.  After many years of struggling with no medications I decided to try buspirone but I was very skeptical it would work because most of my colleagues stated it was a rather ineffectual drug.

It does not work for everyone as many have mentioned but it has given me a second wind to enjoy life to the fullest.,0,210

I had a past of 20  years on prescription Ativan and the after effects of stopping that medication made me very wary of trying anything else for my attacks. But my life had stopped and I truly felt no hope for the future so I laid it all out for my doctor and mentioned that I had noticed an article on Buspar and with little or no side effects or chance of addiction it seemed a chance I would take. My doctor said she had prescribed it many times chosing it for those same reasons with her patients. Since then my anxiety is almost non-existent. I don't feel medicined at all. It did mess with my stomach some but nothing to change my opinion of the medicine. Last hope, best decision.",0,320

I decided to try the Buspar to help with the anxiety using 2 X 10mg per day and it works wonders.  At first the side effects made me cry for nothing but after 1 week everything got resolved and I see the benefits.  No real side effects for me since I use Seroquel which is much stronger on the side effects.  What I see is that I can have dreams again which didn't happen for for the last 20 years and a lot less anxiety.  Less closing of the hands reflects, calm, no social phobia, or performance anxiety.  It is working very well for me and now I need to do more with my life since I have the capacity.  Thanks",0,90

I don't bang things around or rush or hurry, and I am not so preoccupied. The effects are subtle, but there. I am hoping the effects will build up some more over the next two weeks to where I am free of anxiety. No side effects. I am taking this with Celexa (citalopram) 40 mg for depression.",7,17

It made me feel a little off for the first few days.I want to point out something I haven't seen in any of the other reviews. My anxiety was getting so bad that I was abusing my current prescriptions of Lortab and Xanax. I was taking 10-18 7.5mg Lortab and 5-8 1mg Xanax daily just to stay level and to sleep at night. The Lortab was taking control and I knew I had to stop, but withdrawals are HORRIBLE. Just in this week I'm down to 1 Lortab and 1 Xanax a day. I'm currently taking 10mg twice daily of buspirone. It has just about eliminated my dependence of Lortab and Xanax, however I do take Lortab for pain. I urge anyone with similar situation to give it a chance.",10,26

I stopped using the drug and got a few migraines but the rage is gone.",0,37
Buspirone,<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 Before I started taking buspar it felt like there was a ticking time bomb inside my body and throughout the years it just got louder and louder.

Now I'm back on it again and will stay on it until I feel that way again. It took a couple weeks, and a few days of depression, before it took hold but I have never experienced any side effects. In fact the only thing I feel is that I am thinking positively, rather than looking for a boogey-man in everything. Just a natural feeling of health. Recently the doctor tried something else because of poor sleep and gave me lorazepam, which made my arms and legs feel heavy and I slept for 12 hours, and then diazepam which did nothing much but dampened my feelings and sleep was worse. I'll stay with Buspar.",0,148

I tried 5-HTP and that didn't work, so about a month ago my prescription was still there and I started taking Buspar again, and I'm on 7.5 mg twice a day and I feel a big difference, I think the key is to take it like its prescribed.

My doctor prescribed Buspar and everything went away and I felt normal and stress free and the feelings I had went away. I also read Buspar is for short term, but as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. You should take it as long as you need to. Without it I would be a wreck.  As for side effects I get dizzy and tired, I take one 15mg at night and the other in the afternoon after work and take about a 30 minute break and lay down or just watch T.V.

Hopefully Buspar will keep working for me.,0,63

I had built up a tolerance to most of them, so my Doctor prescribed Buspar.  Not being part of the benzodiazepine family, the effects are different and a bit more subtle then I have been used to, however, I have learned to appreciate the difference, because I was looking for something different.  Buspar at least for myself is looking promising.  I also have LexApro, but am hesitant to mix these two medicines at the same time.",0,54
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I wish I could say that Buspar helped me.  I was really hoping that I would have the same experience as some of the individuals here.  I think the Buspar actually made my anxiety worse. However, I didn't feel any side effects until I took it for about 2 weeks.   I had the dizziness and fatigue that many have commented on, but also the less common side effects like gastrointestinal problems, nausea, confusion, and lack of concentration.  I had to stop taking it because it was impairing me so badly.  I hope that this medication works for others but it, unfortunately, did not for me.",0,72
Buspirone,"It took about one month to work for me, but now I'm much calmer, less tense, and much more patient in everyday life. This medicine has truly given me my life back. I took this drug paired with Neurontin and Abilify and the combination of them made me feel even better.",10,7
Buspirone,"I was prescribed 10 mg of this medicine twice daily. After seeing no results, my doctor increased the dosage to three times daily, and it has helped a lot.

I do get dizzy so I have to lay down for 30 minutes after every dose. I am supposed to take 1/2 pill twice a day but laying down is not an option for me on most days so I skip a dose or two. Sometimes I do not take it for weeks. I do notice when I take it for a few days like I should that when I miss a dose I am even more agitated/aggravated/anxious and as one said looking for the bad that is around the corner.

Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I've got generalized anxiety disorder. Buspar turns off the worrying like a switch. The only downside was the first dose; 15mg was too much. I had weird side effects; if I looked at a light source, I'd feel unspeakably strange pulses of something that felt like electricity go though my body. I also got motion sick and vomited after the first dose. Luckily this only happened once. After reducing the dose to 5mg (q.i.d.), I had no more side effects. My advice to the uninitiated would be to start with a small dose and titrate upwards to avoid any surprises.",0,214

After 10 years of anxiety and 2 years of being practically invalid due to generalized anxiety disorder and panic attacks with depression, I'm finally having a medicine that works.  Neuroleptics like ketiamine just made me gain weight, Cipralex was a little help, but not really adding quality of life. After 5 days on Buspar I'm clearly better.

I don't feel cloudy headed or unable to function. It's as if one day I woke up and my life is stress free. I did not suffer any side effects but I am also not on any other medication. I do not drink or smoke. I was opposed to medication at first, but now I am a believer.",0,535
Buspirone,Day 3: 30 mg each day and my tension headaches are gone as well as the tension in my jaws. I feel very relaxed and calm. The only down side is I felt like my legs could not quite relax as I try to go to sleep. This is not really bad and may go away as I adjust.,0,10
Buspirone,"I have been on buspirone for about 5 days now and I already feel the effects from it.  My mind is slightly slowing down and my whole body is starting to balance out a little bit already.  Anxiety has controlled my life for years and though it's only a slight difference, I am confident because it's only been 5 days.  My only problem is that about 30 minutes after I take it, I sometimes feel a bit loopy. It's not too bad and it only lasts about 20 minutes or so but overall, I'm confident that this medication will help me even more in the future.",9,13
Buspirone,<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 Always had negative side effects and weight gain with SSRI's. SSNRI's didn't realy do anything either.  I am not a depressive person by nature so was not really sure why my General practitioner prescribed those.  Saw a psychiatrist who was a lifesaver in recommending and prescribing Buspar for me. I am not worrying or irritable only after 3 days.  He has me on 1/2 a pill in the am and 1/2 at night and is still slowly increasing it up to an ideal dose of 30mg a day.  Thank you Buspar.,0,141
Buspirone,"<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 I was given this in the 1980's for panic attacks and was not taking any benzodiazepines at all with it. I'm glad it has worked so well for others, but for me it was like a very bad trip. I was literally bouncing from wall to wall, couldn't walk or see clearly, even hallucinating. I had a severe reaction to it, but I am extremely sensitive to tricyclics and all SSRI's except Remeron. If you're taking it for the first time, might be good to have another person around just in case.",0,63
Buspirone,"At first I thought my doctor gave me a placebo since I am usually very sensitive to medicines and will have every side effect listed. Started with 5mg three times a day. Noticed that after a few days that my daily tension headaches were gone and my energy level had increased. After two weeks the tightness in my throat eased and palpitations were much better. 12 weeks later I feel really good, alert, much calmer, no headaches or palpitations. My energy level is wonderful, not that nervous energy (GAD sufferers know what I am talking about). I don't feel the need to nap any longer. It's quiet in my head and I love it. Will take this medicine for as long as I can. This medication takes a while to kick in, so please try to stick with it for at least 8 weeks, it's worth it.",10,47

The side effects experienced are dizziness, tingling in the fingertips, vivid dreams and the occasional stomach ache.  Been taking 5mg, 5 times a day. I do also compliment the medicine with the occasional 0.25mg Xanax when needed.  After 3 weeks I do notice a big difference in the amounts of anxiety and a elimination of symptoms, which used to work their way to the panic stage. So far between these medicines, daily exercise, self education, and therapy I seem to be making some progress. I would recommend giving it a try.",0,124
Buspirone,"This tiny pill has been a God send for me after years of trying different antidepressants and benzodiazepines for my GAD and occasional panic. Honestly, I had little hope that Buspar would work. My starting dose was 5mg twice a day and I stayed there. This medicine had an impact on my health from day one. A few hours after taking my first dose I noticed my ever present palpitations had ceased. By day 2 my daily headaches were 90 percent better. By the end of week one the lump in my throat was gone. Now, after 6 weeks I am calm, energized, friendly and very patient with my daughter, family and friends. I have also lost 11 pounds. My head is clear, my thoughts are 'normal' and I feel focused.

My anxiety returned and my dr and I decided to restart the medication at the same dosage but this time, I am having side effects. It's only been a few days but I have a headache, nausea, and dizziness. I've tried taking it at night vs in the morning but there is no difference. I have read that side effects can improve over time but am wondering if anyone has cut their dose to 2.5mg.

Escitalopram,"When I first took this, it literally got me what felt like high. Not in a good way. I felt so unstable, disconnected, and just fully terrible. I read peoples reviews saying  I feel better on no medication than this one  and I shrugged it off. Now I totally understand their point of view. I was  okay  for a week, I felt happier, but high. Im not sure if my serotonin is just THAT low, but I doubt it. I seriously dont recommend this to anyone who is severely anxious, as you may feel okay at first, then it throws you completely off. I couldnt remember anything, I was clumsy, I felt so disconnected that I just wanted to go to bed because being awake was just too hard, it felt impossible.

Drs couldn't find anything wrong and my anxiety was intense from these which led them to believe it must be panic attacks. First week low dose felt really messed up but I was encouraged to keep it up.  Then one day I suddenly dropped into paralysis and felt a fear I that I didn't know I was capable of feeling. I've been bad before many times and never felt this kind of fear. It felt like my organs were shutting down. I couldn't scream. I couldn't breathe. I was deaf and blind, while sweat poured off me. Everything was paralyzed.     It lasted a few minutes and I hyperventilated when it finally stopped as I had been unable to breathe that whole time.  The Dr told me it was a panic attack and to keep taking them. I said I couldn't and he said it's just a placebo anyways. He didn't believe my reaction and became angry with me. Because of this I now have a huge fear of SSRIs and distrust in the medical system.",0,43

Escitalopram,"Today marks one year since beginning lexapro - I went from not even being able to get up and do a presentation classes because my knees would shake so bad and my voice would quiver to the point you couldnt understand me - now Im confident when I get up there and actually get out everything I practiced before hand. I also used to overthink and cry ALOT - i think now theres maybe an 80% decrease of crying in my life. No huge major panic attacks since about the second month of the drug - was initially put on it as I had to go to the ER for breathing issues due to panic attacks. Seriously if you are contemplating an SSRI for your anxiety dont hesitate to suggest this one to your doctor - Im so glad it was suggested to me. Down side: I would say that I have gained weight from the med, maybe around 10-15 lbs however I dont think this is necessarily a bad thing as I dont think I had the most healthy appetite when my anxiety was at its peak (constant stomach aches).",8,33

I couldn't leave the house and get into a car without a full blown panic attack-- sobbing, nausea, the works. Therapy wasn't cutting it, and neither was meditation or any of the suggestions people threw at me.  The first week of Lexapro, the nausea was very intense. But I could feel it changing my brain, and it was such a weird yet hopeful feeling.  For three years, I had my life back. I was able to travel and enjoy taking risks without crippling anxiety.

Also felt like I had to be drinking water 24/7; my mouth was so dry. Smaller side effect was waking up in the morning and feeling pretty zonked but it didnt affect daily life, was just happy to be doing something to improve my condition. I was also prescribed Remeron at one point for sleeping problems. That didnt work so I started on Seroquel xr. this medication along with seroquel has been such a positive change in feeling for me. Definitely can recommend but maybe along with a secondary medication because I wouldnt say this medication helped greatly with AD as much as it does with MDD.",7,4

Xanax was the only magic pill that calmed my anxious stomach mind connection but its not ideal long term so I tried Escitalopram. The beginning is not pleasant and the drug caused more stomach upset initially. 4 months later on 20mg I feel a lot better. My anxiety has reduced a lot and my stomach is better. It is giving me space to heal that troublesome mind gut connection. Also side note anxiety usually causes you to produce less stomach acid and not more stomach acid. The symptoms are the same but the treatment is different. Doctor readily hand out acid suppressing drugs but usually what you need is more stomach acid. HCI supplements really helped me along with digestive enzymes supplements and fermented foods. Also cutting out alcohol, chocolate, coffee and other irritants.",9,15

The easiest way for me to explain my overall state on lexipro is that when I feel my anxiety rising, I am more aware of it and am able to pull myself out of a spiral. For me, that is the best part.  Because of the lessened anxiety, I also have fewer IBS flare ups.",0,46
Escitalopram,Switched from Citalopram at max dose to escitalopram at max dose. At first it left a funny cloudy feeling at my frontal lobe area which actually kind of helped me forget somethings but I also didnt seem to care. Didnt last long and made me feel just kind of mentally gross. Also put on weight that has lasted to this day.  My anxiety returned but it helped me not care about the negative ways I dealt with it. Definitely with drinking and being an all around uncaring slob.  I reduced dose and quit it and restarted a couple of times which made me feel so bad(brain zaps!)

The first week I had slight nausea, diarrhea and no appetite but I did start feeling more calm. Lexapro helped me so much. I could drive without feeling anxious, go to work events with confidence. I was better with handling situations at work and at home. Unfortunately the downside for me was I ended up gaining 15lbs within 5 months. It definitely slowed down my metabolism. It was easy to gain and no matter how much healthier I tried to eat I could not lose the weight. I have been slender my whole life so this was making me feel so depressed about the way I looked.

My emotions are almost completely blunted now, my sex drive is literally at it's lowest. For someone who's quite emotional, it's a con.  I also got very irritable while on it, was getting angry at any little thing, though i'm a really peaceful and non-aggressive person. Also, one of my pupils was always enlarged for some reason.

Stopped clenching my teeth, stopped panicking about everything. Was only dizzy once. Forgot to take it with me on holidays , and got super anxious sitting in a traffic jam. Never again.

But Id read other reviews that encouraged me to push through! Im so glad I did! Im at week 4 on a dose of 5mg Lexapro and Ive had no more panic attacks and anxiety is greatly reduced/manageable. Im looking forward to how Ill feel in another 4 weeks! No side effects have remained after the initial week or two. I did find it made me sleepy taking it in the morning, so I just changed to taking it at night which solved that problem. Hang in there if youre just starting it and its rough. It will get better!",0,93
Escitalopram,"<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 Was diagnosed with anxiety recently and prescribed Lexapro. First few days felt weird, started getting headaches, brain fog, libido gone. These were common effects so I kept it going. I noticed my anxiety was gone, but I couldn't cry either. I was emotionally numb and had no empathy for others. 8 days in I started getting suicidal thoughts. Keep in mind I start this for anxiety and NOT depression/suicidal thoughts! I was very scared of myself as it felt like a second conscience was forming in my brain, one that'd tell me I'm worthless and ugly, and I'd argue with it with my normal conscience. 3 days into these new thoughts the more I was on it the more this depressive conscience took over, and I was forming ways on how to commit suicide. I was too scared to continue at this point so I stopped and my anxiety is back but I have not gotten suicidal thoughts since. And this was all only on 5mg. As said by my doctor, please halt using this drug immediately if you get suicidal thoughts.",0,25
Escitalopram,"Like many others have said, stick though the side effects in the first 6 weeks. It is uncomfortable but well worth it. After a couple months I haven't had any panic attacks. Ive increased the dosage to 15mg and had the side effect of sleepiness in the mornings and vivid dreams both of which have dissipated and become less noticeable over time. The benefits are far greater than the risk of side effects! Do not give up! Relief is on the way. I am happy and at peace with myself. I feel calmer and more productive.",10,23

The first day wasnt so bad, just felt really dizzy later in the day. From the second to fourth day, it has been horrible. I am up all night, am feeling like my heart is racing, I get very dizzy, and I am becoming nauseous. It is causing me to worry even more, and after reading the side effects (although most are rare), I do not want to continue taking this med, as it is really increasing my anxiety. I know I should try to stick it out but at this point I cant. I guess This med just isnt the right one for me.",1,11
Escitalopram,"<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 I developed sleep anxiety, which is absolutley awful. After  experiencing insomnia I developed an anxiety at the thought of sleep. Even the approaching evening would trigger it. I felt hopeless. It led to depression and suicidal thoughts. I was put on lexapro a eventually went up to 15 mg. It helped me reclaim my life. It put my anxiety at bay so I could change my life. It took about 6 weeks for the drug to really start working along with minimal side effects. It has been a year and I am currently tapering off the medication because I feel I do not need it anymore. It is a good drug! Allow some time for it to kick in. Also, use the medication as a tool.

Escitalopram,"I have been on this drug twice now and both times it worked at decreasing my anxiety. For those of you who are new to this medication, please don't be afraid of the side effects. Yes they can be miserable and make anxiety worse for several weeks as it adjusts the chemicals in your brain. And that's alright! You didn't develop anxiety in a few days so you shouldn't expect it to go away quickly, either. If you're having trouble, ask your doctor for adjustments to dosage and timing. I'm writing this review now after about 7 months of treatment (this time around--my anxiety and I have a complicated relationship) because I remember being scared and seeing negative reviews made my anxiety worse.

After 3-4 weeks it started to work and I honestly didn't know I could feel this good. My brain no longer races, I don't over analyze things or-over worry. I had no idea just how bad my anxiety was all these years and that I didn't have to live like that.

Started with 10mg for week 1, then upped to 20mg (appears dose is far too high far too quick for an extremely mild case of anxiety and depression).  GP stated only side effect to worry about was decreased libido. 6 weeks later my partner of 6 years kicked me out of our home and terminated our relationship - I had become increasingly aggressive and volatile.  I am also a diabetic with glaucoma problems in my eyes and I am pedantic about my eye health and keeping both eye pressures stable - they have been for the last 5 years.  Once I read about the bad side effects, I immediately had my pressures checked - both eyes had skyrocketed to dangerous levels.  Have slowly weaned off these pills over a period of 8 weeks with my eye pressures slowly retuning back to acceptable levels and have been free of this horrendous chemical for 3 weeks now.",0,17

Escitalopram,"Earlier in the year I had a massive panic attack at work, went off on stress leave.  Started cipralex 5mg for 4 days and no effects then upped to 10mg.  Then I had headaches/ nausea/ fatigue that passed after a couple weeks.  Then I felt amazing, I didn't realize life could feel normal.  My whole life previously was anxious.  Fast forward 6months, I started having very vivid bothersome dreams and had difficulty waking up in the morning.  So I stopped taking it.  Brain zaps like crazy, they passed but my anxiety slowly came back.  So here I am restarting the whole process again.  10mg for the winter dark months and 5mg for the spring and summer months.  Praying it helps, because I'll never come off of it again.   Hang in there, the side effects pass!!  If this drug isn't for you, try another.  I tried Zoloft and thought it was going to be the end of me. but this one works for me.  It's not for everyone.  Trust that what doesn't work for one person might work for you:)",8,4
Escitalopram,"Horrible experience with Lexapro! Anxiety was far worse, chest pain, headaches, insomnia. It got to the point of going to the ER and told to hold out just a little longer and it will work. It didnt. I was having terrible side effects from it. My Dr. switched me to Wellbutrin and its been wonderful. Night and day difference. Lexapro may work for some people but it didnt work for me, we are all different. If it isnt working for you try Wellbutrin, most Drs wont prescribe Wellbutrin at first but the sexual side effects on are barely none at all and you feel amazing day to day. Good Luck!",1,3
Escitalopram,"I really liked this medication and found I was able to not over think and not over react to daily stressors. The only reason Im stopping is Because of weight gain. Despite my many efforts of trying to prevent it and all my heather eating, the weight was just piling on. So now my doc has tapered me off and I will be starting something new next week!!",7,3
Escitalopram,"This drug has been a serious life saver for me!! For those of you that are experiencing the increased anxiety and a few weird side effects after a few weeks, yes I got that too, it goes away! Stick out your normal dose and do not up because of this or again the side effects gets worse. Just ride it out. Will be the best thing you have ever done :) Before cipralex I had no idea what it was like to wake up and make my morning tea without worrying about a million things and being anxious. My nervousness is gone, my shakes gone, my productivity increased and I am socially awkward no more.  Stick out the initial side effects its just your body adjusting :)",10,18
Escitalopram,"The reviews helped me a lot to stick it out and keep going! Thanks!I was suffering from stress that caused me anxiety and ended up in panic attacks that were getting worse. I couldn't even eat or sleep coz of my fear of panicking again my negative thinking was non stop! Dr. prescribed me this med. I started with low doses (5mg 1wk), 10(1wk), 15(1wk), until 20mg, which is the dose that I'm taking till now. The process is SLOW, you have to have PATIENCE and see the improvement little by little. I had few side effects the 1st week, after 2 1/2 weeks I started feeling a slight improvement, but far away from being normal. Now I've been 8wks by 20 mg. I'm feeling much better, negative thinking has decreased and I've more joy and can manage my life better. In moments when I'm feeling really anxious I take 0,5/ 1 mg Lorazepam (Ativan) to calm my anxiety down.  To those who are suffering from terrible anxiety like I did don't give up! You'll be rewarded and you'll feel better, I'm so thankful for this med!",9,15
Escitalopram,"I took Lexapro for two days on 10mg and was almost immediately hit by the side effects. Two days of vomiting, intense digestion issues, fatigue, insomnia, nausea and a loss of appetite coupled with extreme hunger. I was unable to eat anything, and taking other medications to help the nausea made me vomit them back up again.  I decided to stop after the second day and have barely been able to sleep more than three hours a night since despite being too tired to function. It also increased my anxiety by an insane amount, Ive been too anxious to even lay down! I will never be taking this again, and I would not wish this experience on anyone.",1,14

Yes there is sexual side effect but no choice.",10,6
Escitalopram,"I want to thank all who posted to hang in there. Those reviews kept me going when I would have given up. My anxiety was so much worse when I started Lexapro on 5mg. I would wake around 3AM with anxiety so bad it was shy of a panic attack. It would be 4 or 5 hours of feeling anxious, restless and downright horrible. I was sick to my stomach and had no appetite. Eventually this eased a little when I got to 10mg but then we added  insomnia. Im 3 1/2 weeks in now and feel better than I have in months. I can sleep again and if my anxiety was a 10 before, it doesnt pass a 2-3 now. Lifesaving med just horrible adjustment period for me. Hang in there!!",9,28

Insomnia and waking up with full on panic attacks, pins and needles , ringing in my ears, worse am panic, afraid to be alone during the day. Please tell me it gets better cause right now I am hating this drug but need to control my panic and anxiety",0,10
Escitalopram,Horrible first couple of hours on escitalopram... I've taken before without any issues this time it was bad. Took 10mg just before bed and within an hour I'm starting to hallucinate and hear things that are not there. My chest is vibrating and hearing a constant ringing in my ears and extremely tired like I'm falling asleep while I'm awake breathing heavy and cannot sleep and made my anxiety far worse and a sore head to go along with it.

After 2 hours of taking the medication I had a terrible panic attack with a fast heartbeat, super fatigued, dizziness, sweats and a little lethargic. The doctor wanted me to cut the pill and half and continue taking it but I am way too afraid and would rather not deal with those side effects and just deal with my anxiety and self heal.",0,22

Escitalopram,"I used this site as therapy while taking this drug, here's my experience: My starting dose was  on 2.5mg escitalopram for 5 days, 5mg for 5, then 10mg. You HAVE to start slow. No side effects until 10mg, then they were the worst. The anxiety was 10x worse, I had pins and needles and a complete loss of appetite for 2 weeks after starting 10mg. I knew I was getting better when one day I actually wanted to eat food, instead of force feeding myself. So, now you are over the worst of it, but guess what? You are just back at the beginning - not feeling a lot better or worse than when you started. YOU HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 3 weeks for it to actually start making you feel better! It's slow - one day you feel pretty decent, then there will be a 2 days in a row, then 3 days, etc. If you are going into this medication, you have to go slow and give yourself at least 6 weeks. Anything sooner and you may be disappointed. But, like most say here, it does work and for me, it's a lifesaver. I will be on this for many many years.",9,38

Escitalopram,Like many anxiety sufferers I was on this site everyday (multiple times a day sometimes) to see if this drug would help because I was skeptic and wasn't sure how long I could continue feeling the worst anxiety/depression out of nowhere in my life recently. But all the good reviews gave me hope. I started on 2.5 mg for a week and went up to 5 mg for 2 weeks. Only slight improvement. But my doc upped my dosage to 10 mg and after about 2-3 weeks I started feeling better. I also take very low dose Hydroxyzine for quick relief and sleep aid but starting to not need it as much now. I think Escitalopram really helped me. The anxiety still creeps up now and then but it's a lot more manageable. The only thing is it took some time (about 2 months) to figure out the right dosage and kick in. Hoping it keeps getting better as I keep taking it. Good luck and hang in there!,9,16

Its been about 4 weeks or so and the feeling of a lump in my throat is coming back again with tight shoulders etc so think Im gonna move to 15mg The only side effect I have noticed is a bit of a trembly feeling and headache, Ill take those verses the crippling anxiety anyday",10,9

I was terrified of the side effects but decided I needed to get better. I am not going to lie... the first week was AWFUL! I had every side effect: insomnia the first week was terrible with increased anxiety in a.m. and through the night, my RLS was really amped up at night, I was nauseous the first 3 days, no appetite for about 8-10 days, very sleepy, lack of motivation, etc. By day 10  I could tell the medicine was starting to work because I was having moments of feeling normal.

Just 4 hours after taking my first 10mg dose (at 8am), I wanted to vomit, was very dizzy and felt confused and disoriented.  I also had an extremely dry mouth.  By 5pm that evening my anxiety had gotten 10 times worse, and I suffered the absolutely WORST panic attack I have ever had in my life.  My panic was so bad I briefly passed out.

More recently I have had some general stresses and spoke to my doc about my lack of sleep and anxiety. He suggested taking Lexapro to help with this. I started with a 1/4 of a 10mg tab for the first 4 days. Then moved up to half a tab for 6 days. And tomorrow I start a full tablet. Though Ive only just started, Im happy to report no side effects and I do believe I am already reaping some benefit.

I had less anxiety and more motivation to do things and maintain the relationships I had made, and also to encourage new ones. I had had mood swings severely before I had taken the drug and after I began to feel very consistent. I feel as though I can function normally, that I can have conversations with people without freaking out or worrying as much on how I came across to others. I still have worries, but they are worries over things that are easier to deal with and not earth-shattering like when I was off of the drug.

I take both at night and while the Temazepam is supposed to help me sleep, I wake up around 2 AM and I'm restless.  My skin was crawling, my heart was racing, and my blood pressure was high. I felt like I couldn't catch my breath. My PCP prescribed me a beta blocker to assist me with the feeling that my heart is about to come out of my chest. I take the beta blocker twice a day and they do help. I also have Xanax. I don't want to give up on the medication yet, I know results are not immediate.

The medication has lessened the grip of those thoughts and that fear on me. Anxious thoughts still arise sometimes, but it's so much easier to ignore them, move on and be distracted for them. I marvel at how great I feel - I'm more fun, I'm more likely to say yes to social opportunities and I feel better about myself and am working out 4-5 times/week without feeling anxious.

Also, the weight gain was horrible. He also stated NOT from Lexapro.  It is now two years later and had an incident in family and developed anxiety again. Back on the Lexapro 5mg. Well, let me tell you. I took it six days and stopped. I had racing heart, numbness in leg and so dizzy I almost hit the floor. Once again, doctor said this is not from Lexapro. I talked him into clonazepam for short term. He was reluctant but I am responsible and have done clonazepam in the past for short term.  It is 0.5 daily for two weeks and then a short taper. We will see what happens. I will not do Lexapro again. Also, blood pressure was too high 144/88. I am checking it every day now. The latest reading was 117/78.",0,10

I believe my body tolerates everything better than someone who never used anything. Keep that in mind as its a good thing. The med is definitely effective and without it life becomes black and white.

Escitalopram,"Hello In Feb 2018 I hurt my spine again with an incredibly painful muscle spasm. After 25 hours I was in hospital and the blood tests show septicemia (sepsis). After 8000mgs antibiotics for 20 days I developed bad anxiety. They put me on nortriptyline (10mgs) I am super sensitive to all drugs. That helped with sleep, a wee bit with anxiety and nerve pain but I also lost a 1/3 of my hair and had severe constipation. Eight weeks ago I asked to change so I was given escitalopram. I noticed my anxiety ramping up but had been told it may do this . By week 3 I was a mess. I had to fly alone to join my husband at his fathers funeral and I nearly did not get the plane. I started a panic attack at the airport. I had to have half a glass of wine to get on that plane . I stopped the escitalopram from that day and have had no anxiety since Feb 2018. I do not why my body can not take these meds, but I am 10000% better off anti anxiety meds. Cheers from NZ",1,7

I'm on 20mg. It helps with physical panic symptoms - I don't feel the prickles/tingles and sick stomach as much, nor have I felt panicked for a while actually, which is nice. I still have anxiety, especially because a massive anxiety symptom of mine is brain fog, so because I can't sleep, I feel very unclear and that gives me anxiety. (hard to explain). It also helps with worry - I don't find myself ruminating and overthinking everything as much.",0,16
Escitalopram,I would suggest people ease in to Escitalopram.   After initial 10 mg dose I was rendered sleepless.  I have reduced the dose 75% down to 2.5 mg and spaced it out through the day  and this seems a lot more tolerable.   I am pleased that this drug seems to be cutting down on very very troublesome cardiac arrhythmia which Ive had for years.  I have been through the hell of benzodiazepines and withdrawal .  So I hope I can thread the needle with the right approach to finally tackle this after five years of struggle.,6,7

For the first two weeks, I experienced some side effects like a major panic attack and increased anxiety initially, nausea and fatigue along with constant yawning even when I wasn't tired. These side effects have since all disappeared. I have noticed that I still have some anxiety at times but it happens less often and when it does happen, it is easier to manage and doesn't get out of control. My mood has also improved and I do not experience the really low feelings that I used to experience and I have less intrusive and negative thoughts.

Escitalopram,"<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 I was prescribed Lexapro 10mg for anxiety. I took the pill for two days and what followed was the worst week of my life. I would describe my anxiety as a little more than mild. It was never debilitating. I shouldn't have been prescribed it. I took one pill in the morning and woke up in the middle of the night with a full blown panic attack. I had never experienced anything like that in my life. For three full days I couldn't sleep or eat. I had no desire to do anything but was incapable of sitting or lying down. I was constantly in a panic because I thought my life was over. I would start crying, again something that never happened to me before. On the third day after I had stopped the drug I finally felt normal again. The feelings did come back over night and I'm still feeling effects this morning. Please use this drug with extreme caution. I know it can be a help to a lot of people but make sure to do your research.",0,23
Escitalopram,I went on lexapro for my anxiety and it definitely helped in the beginning. About six months in I started feeling extremely nervous and anxious. I was tired all the time. During the weekends I would take 3 naps a day and still get a good nights sleep. I tapered and have been completely off of it for a week. I feel like a new person and that someone else was living in my body while I was on it.,3,12

I have dealt with the anxiety that comes from the worry and the panic attacks too. It wasnt until I turned 40 that I mentioned this to a new doctor I started seeing and he prescribed Lexapro. My god, I wish someone had opened my eyes before. I assumed everyone felt this way but after a month on Lexapro it was a weight lifted off of my shoulders. I am so happy to not feel all of that anxiety anymore. Normal stress is fine but the overwhelming feeling of anxiety is gone and I hope it stays that way. Its been close to 4 years now and its still working for me. Lexapro really is an amazing drug.",0,70

I used to take Xanax for it but wanted something more consistent. I discovered Lexapro and it was the best thing. After 6 months of being on it my anxiety is 99% gone and dont need Xanax anymore. In the beginning I had a really rough time with coming off the Xanax and starting the Lexapro. I couldnt sleep, no appetite (plus!) lol, and felt horrible. Id say after about 5-6 weeks my body adjusted and I feel better then ever. My energy is there and I feel really happy and chipper but its all genuine. Im on 10mg and will continue with it.

I still have moments of the month that make me more vulnerable to anxiety because of hormonal ups and downs, but overall, I feel like Ive found myself again. For the first year, I noticed some numbness in emotions. It was manageable and almost welcomed, since Id spent so much time over thinking and feeling things. I feel like this has balanced out over time. I also take it in the morning because it would cause me some insomnia at first. Please talk to a doctor prior to attempting to wean off this medication because it can be difficult. I feel like this medication has really changed my life for the better.",0,39

I used to have episodes of crying, extreme depression and suicidal thoughts but all those have gone away or diminished to the point where they're basically nonexistent. I feel like I can handle life and it's minor irritations with so much more confidence now. More than I have ever in the past. I still have issues and every day is still a battle at times but I don't know what I would do if I hadn't started on this medication.

Escitalopram,"<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 Anxiety/depression medications are tricky. Its difficult to know what one is best for you and your body so often you have to try a couple of different ones before you find your fit. In my personal experience its worth trying a few till you find whats right for you. Every medication is going to have side effects. For me Lexapro decreases my sex drive and causes constipation. The benefit of not having anxiety and being able to be a peaceful wife and mother is worth those two side effects for me. I have come off my Lexapro before and its true you will definitely have a lot of brains zaps, headache, a little irritability, and for me déjà vu. The brains zaps dont usually last more than two months and they are harmless so you just have to ignore them. Overall I think Lexapro is a great medication but as I said before its different for each individual. Talk to your doctor. Therapy is also very helpful for me.",0,25

Two years later anxiety is back and doctor prescribed Lexapro again. After day 3, I have had enough. I woke up soak and wet in sweat and the nausea is just too much. The worst was when I got up for water I got so dizzy I almost hit the kitchen floor. Also, last time I packed on the pounds (like 20). I have lost 4lbs this go around. All I can look at is cereal and that is not even appealing. I know my doctor would prescribe clonazepam again but I really don't want to go that route. I will see how I feel in the next couple of days and call him if not better. I know people say to hang in there but just not for my anymore.",0,17
Escitalopram,"Had severe panic disorder and every phobia in the book from age 20 to 40. Took benzos and alcohol to manage it. Finally my doctor persuaded me to take Lexapro. I told myself firmly not to be fooled by placebo effects, good or bad. I just took the damn thing because I was suffering so why not at this point? No personality changes. No zombie experience. Loose stools, especially in the first couple of months. Basically it took my anxiety down from a 10/10 to a 6/10. It also got rid of my frequent migraines, and I can actually fall asleep without downers now. I know every drug is tolerated differently by different people, but this works all right. Doesn't end your anxiety cold but seems to prevent those enormous ridiculous panic attacks from reaching a severe level.",8,8
Escitalopram,"<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 Extreme anxiety, I was barely able to look anyone in the eye or leave my house.  Things were getting very bad and I didnt know how to fix or deal with it.  I was put on 10 mg lexapro by my new doctor.  I took half a pill a day for one week and didnt notice any difference.  I actually had pretty severe headaches, problems with my sexual life and extreme exhaustion.  I began taking a full 10 mg pill a few days ago (Im on day 10) and I have noticed I am back to my normal self.  The anxiety has completely gone away.   It seems it has saved my life.  The exhaustion and headaches went away.  It seems like this may be common in the first week or so.  The  negative to lexapro is some issues with sex (ejaculating specifically).  I have heard your body can adjust and eventually that will become normal as well.  I would definitely recommend people to give this medicine a few weeks to a month before giving up on it.  Mine took about 9 days to kick in.",0,38

I took lexapro the next day after and I constantly felt nauseous and had no appetite even though I felt like I was starving.

The second week I just turned full zombie, no emotions what so ever. I couldn't cry, get angry or feel anything, which actually made my anxiety worse as I didn't know what has happening to me.

Escitalopram helped the anxiety, but after about 8 months, felt numb- like a robot, gained 35 lbs, lost all interest in sex and was impossible to orgasm. It did help with my anxiety, but not depression. I weaned myself off of it and felt better for awhile. About 7 months later I found my anxiety had returned and I resumed the Cipralex. Felt the anxiety go away, took it for 10 months- had same bad side effects come back- severely depressed, no sex, no orgasm, weight gain (gained a total of 50 lbs) and I am an active person who walks, so, clearly the weight gain was from the medication- must have effected my metabolism as I didn't change how I was eating- ate fish, chicken, garden salads, low fat and no fat as well as walked- but still gained the 50 lbs.

Escitalopram,"Now age 69, I have been trying to get off alcohol and low-dose benzos for insomnia/anxiety for the past 2-3 years.  The latest and most effective substitute has been 10 mg daily escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro), which Ive been on for 6 months.  It took a couple weeks (at 5 mg daily) to kick in, then works great (for anxiety, at least) as long as I dont drink, stay up late, or cut my benzo dose.  This has enabled me to gradually cut down my benzo (clonazepam/Klonipin) dose from 1 mg to 0 (0 as of 6 days ago).  Im writing this mainly to report an interesting side effect: my libido is better, so are my erections and have sexy dreams.  I know Lexapro is supposed to dampen libido (although I never noticed this before, nor any significant benzo effects), but there you have it.  Still havent tried it out with my wife (weve been babysitting grandkids all week) but have high hopes.  So theres another reason to stick with your Lexapro and get off your benzos, if you need one!!!!",8,8

Within days, I go from  anti-social nervous wreck when I'm off it, to a very rational, confident and outgoing person when I'm back on it. If you're painfully anxious, negative and self-loathing (like I find myself sometimes) , Lexapro can make you the life of the party - an empathetic, engaged and caring human being you know you really are deep down inside. I started taking in my 40s- it would have drastically altered my life if I had started at a younger age. But that's okay, I have it now and I'm eternally grateful.

Lack of sleep made things worse; general life was a nightmare. I couldn't stand in lines, didn't like getting on planes, etc. 2 separate medical prof. suggested escitalopram (EO). I started 5 mg for 2 weeks, then up to 10. At week 3, my dr. prescribed Belsomra for sleep. The Belsomra I took for 7 days did give me relief for sleep. After 4 weeks, the EO started having it's positive effects. I've been sleeping well since with no abnormal anxiety. I've never had side effects from EO. After 6 months 10 mg daily, I was feeling drowsy. I reduced to 10, 10, 5 mg 3 day pattern. With doctor's approval, I further reduced. After 16 months from start, I'm at 2.5 mg daily.

Everything took about six weeks to kick in, so be patient. I thought I was hopeless, but Im laughing, smiling, feel worry slowly dripping away by the day. Social anxiety is lower every day. I feel confident. I feel like who I was mean to to be. My best piece of advice is to not obsess about whether or not its working. You WILL know when it does, trust me.

I started experiencing such extreme anxiety again I decided to restart my Lexapro at 10mg. Big mistake for my body. I suffered the most extreme panic and adrenaline rushes Ive ever felt.

I took 1st 5mg tablet the Saturday night  and for 5 hours I sweated and writhed in pain as it felt like electric shocks through my body. Was told it would make me sleepy but no I was awake all night. Took 5mg again Sunday night same thing happened Brain shocks burning sensation through my neck all through my body. Never took on the Monday so Tuesday thought I would take half a tablet and I thought I was going to die. The dizziness and sickness was awful. I was given  Diazepam which helped. In total I took 12.5mg over 4 days it took another week for the medication to get out of my system. I'd rather take my chances with anxiety then ever take this medication again.

I started Lexapro out of desperation (5 mg 1st week then 10 mg). The side effects for 4 weeks were horrible: extreme fatigue, insomnia and increased anxiety. For someone who already has severe anxiety this was terrifying! What got me through was reading these reviews (only the positive ones) and taking Ativan .5 mg daily for 3 weeks to help me sleep.  I started improving by 4 weeks and felt much better by 6 weeks. I started living my life again.  It was completely worth it to stick out the awful 1st month.

Escitalopram,I took a while ago for approximately 3 months. The reason I stopped was I was experiencing some gastrointestinal bleeding. SSRI's do effect blood clotting and so I stopped the medication and this resolved. I have restarted this med because it was helpful and hopefully wont have same issue. Currently on day 9.  For me it is a very mild SSRI and much more tolerable than the other SSRI's. The side effects for me was insomnia which was bad for first 3 nights but then improves and also some mildly elevated anxiety for first week. It helps quickly with OCD thoughts and works works for depression/anxiety within a couple of weeks. For me this is a much easier med to get on with than most SSRI's. 10mg.

The first 3 weeks on the medication was BRUTAL! I felt like I was plugged into a light socket and was up in the night with panic attacks for weeks. Then, finally I could tell that it was starting to kick in. I am now 2.5 months and up to 15 mg daily. This medication has drastically improved my quality of life. I am no longer fearful of experiences, have loads of energy because of the loss of the depression, and am motivated to get help and move forward.

I had increased anxiety, extreme tiredness, could sleep all day, nausea and diarrhoea, terrible night sweats and headaches.  Took 4 weeks to start working for me.

It took about 2 weeks for me to feel a difference, and I was blown away by how different my life was. I was going to concerts, traveling, doing things I never thought I would be able to do with my level of anxiety. I switched off Lexapro to try a new drug recently to see if it would work better, but it made my anxiety worse than ever. Thankfully I started Lexapro again last week and I already feel so much better. This drug honestly saved my life and even though everyone is different, I would completely recommend trying it if you have GAD.

It won't fix you, but it'll make it so you can actually breathe again. I used to cry constantly, isolate myself, have panic attacks so frequently I couldn't even sleep, and have horrible intrusive violent thoughts.  1. be proactive when it comes to the nausea side effect. Eat BEFORE you take the pill, and don't let yourself get hungry during the first 3-4 hours after you take the pill. Because once you get nausea it becomes harder to eat, which only makes you more nauseous. It's a vicious cycle that can be prevented. 2. ignore the negative reviews that are like I took this pill for 1 day and it caused *terrifying side effects*. They only cause more anxiety and they're highly unlikely.  3. From my personal experience, the first things to get better were the physical symptoms of anxiety. Less panic attacks, more hungry, less crying, etc. Keeping a journal is helpful to see the progression.",0,104

This has been the ideal dose for me. I have no anxiety and no depression. I feel normal and myself again!",10,19

Escitalopram,<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 I was very hesitant to try any medicine for my persistent anxiety and low grade depression (30+ years of drudgery). I finally called uncle when it was clear that I would literally not make it through without additional help. I went to the doctor and balled my eyes out  as she listened patiently. She started me on 10mg which made things worst for about 2 weeks and then kicked in nicely. I felt sooooo much better. I asked the doctor to increase my dose to 20mg which she agreed to to do. There was an immediate change for the better and now after about a month on 20mg I am feeling almost no anxiety or depression. An amazing drug! Side effects are sleepiness and some loss of libido. The list of good effects are too long to list. Increased patience with the kids. Being a better husband in so many ways. I feel like I am more in control of my life instead of always trying to avoid things that were uncomfortable. I recommend Lexapro!!,0,75
Escitalopram,"At 30 I had my first experience of depression &amp; anxiety. After 2 months of trying the natural &amp; holistic route, my GP advised I try Lexapro. I was so scared &amp; worried about trying this and what effect it would have. I started on 5mg and went up to 10mg after 1week. I was very tired and spaced initially for about 4 days with no appetite or energy but my anxiety &amp; panic attacks decreased within 1 1/2 weeks!  Increasing up to 10mg had no extra side effects. The depression took longer to lift &amp; I increased to 15mg after 6 weeks. This helped hugely! I started to feel a little better after 3-4 weeks but had bad mornings. It lifted slowly and around week 8/9 I felt so much better. I wasnt avoiding crowds, I wasnt overthinking &amp; ruminating. I felt like myself again! I used generic brand Ive found it ok to taper off over 3/4 weeks! Im back on it after relapse. It works for me at 10mg! I hope to drop to 5mg and stay on that long term! Good luck everyone x",9,14

My insomnia improved a fair bit w/in 2 weeks, anxiety decreased. No significant side effects (though a few to start). I was worried about deadened emotions but it hasn't happened. I feel more like myself/calmer. I still get anxious, sad, happy, where its called for but don't have all consuming anxiety Startup was bad, I had extreme increased anxiety w/ the initial 5mg but it went away w/in 4 days (and didn't increase when upped to 10mg).

My hair began falling out in massive clumps. I had visible bald spots and would wear my hair up in a bun to avoid the humiliation of having handfuls of hair fall out. After about 9 months and 40% hair loss I stopped taking this medication, with the assistance of my doctor.  It was only five months later when most of my hair grew back, but so did my anxiety.

I used to find it difficult to fall asleep and when I would I would sleep in until mid-day but now I fall asleep easily and wake up after about 8 hours which is probably a first in my life, and I wake up feeling refreshed and energetic.

I still have work I need to do outside of just taking Lexapro and expecting it to change my life, but it's given me the motivation  to help myself and not feel miserable in the process. Only con I have at this point is occasional brain fog, but I've found that keeping a consistent sleeping routine and eating healthier has helped that a lot. I hope you all feel better soon and stay encouraged that recovery is possible! You will find what works for you! Be blessed.",0,54

Not only I noticed a difference, but everyone around me also did, saying how much more outgoing I was, and I was. It helped with my anxiety and my depression wasnt a big issue, but as I continued to take it, my depression slowly got worse and worse. I eventually stopped going to school and missed like 3 months worth of classes, being in college this was terrible, considering most classes only allow 3-5 absences for an entire semester. Needless to say, my grades went downhill causing me to fall deeper into my depression and never leave my house. Eventually I stopped taking it and while Im still depressed and anxious, its not as bad as the Lexapro made it.

Thats because I pushed myself but was still miserable. It really is reprogramming your mind, but with the THC withdrawals Lexapro definitely saved me.

I just wanna feel like I first did when I started this drug cause I felt like myself and was outgoing and started doing things I love to do again. Anyone have any insight on my situation? I just want some reassurance things will get better if I bump up my dose. I never really had any side effects when I started the 10mg, so I'm not worried about that.",9,4
Escitalopram,"I was a fully functioning person with no anxiety/depression beforehand. However, anxiety hit me out of nowhere and I suffered chronic anxiety that had me feeling anxious throughout the whole day. My anxiety manifested in my derealization symptoms and it fuelled my depression to the point where it was unbearable and I needed help! I couldnt believe this was happening to me, I had no idea what was happening to me! I was put on lexapro 10mg and it is currently my 8th week on it. I feel a lot better; I feel like myself again. The first few weeks were a little brutal, and the next few weeks after I had my handful of bad days/moments, but it DOES get better. Feeling back to normal seems impossible until you start feeling it, and I promise you it is possible. I think it took me until the 6th week to really feel a lot better and like myself again.",9,4

Anxiety, no sleep, jitters (like the feeling when you drink 10 cups of coffee), always tired but can't sleep...etc.  somewhere around day 25 I started to feel good.  Sleeping better 6hrs per night instead of 3, way less anxious and general overall feel positive.  I would definitely say this med has helped my anxiety and the full effects usually kick in anywhere from 6-8 weeks.  I know when your in the early stages each day seems like a week, but eventually there is a light....PLEASE try and have some patience with this or any SSRI.   3- 5 weeks is where you should see SOME improvement.

Depression set in big time in 2012 when I lost my dad. So I finally went to a psychiatrist and he prescribed lexapro. The side effects were hard for me at first. Nausea, jitters, heat intolerance, yawning and jaw clenching. But I felt so much better in terms of my mood. It was kind of a miracle for me. Like someone turned the lights in my life back on. Huge relief. Twelve weeks ago I tried to taper back my dose just to see if I still needed it. Six weeks later I was crying every day, no energy, I felt like just going away, literally, like forever. My husband is a nurse practitioner and he really saw the change in me.  I agreed to go back on my regular dose. It took another 6 weeks to get back to feeling good.

Although there is good days and bad days I can really start to see a difference . Some bad side effects but 100% worth it . Give it a chance and dont give up,8,7
Escitalopram,"I was switched to this when the medication I'd used successfully for 15 years went off my insurance formulary.

By the end of the 2nd week, the side effects alone gave me anxiety. This clearly was the wrong medication for me.  It effects serotonin and my previous med effected other neurotransmitters in the brain. I got off the escitalopram and back on my original med and within a day felt wonderful with no side effects. Make sure your doctor doesn't switch you to a med that doesn't address the particular problem that is creating your anxiety, If you have continuing severe side effects, call your doctor.

I've done overnight sleep studies, nutritional therapy, been checked for parasites, hormonal imbalances, nutrient deficiencies.  My doctor prescribed this medication for another issue but I noticed the sleep eating stopped. Sure enough, there have actually been clinical studies on treating people with NES with SSRIs with huge success This has decreased my appetite so that now I'm actually full after I eat a meal. I used to eat and never feel full. The other amazing thing is that I'm actually getting proper REM sleep now, because my cycle isn't disrupted by multiple awakenings which prevented me from getting into a deep sleep",0,7

I was at a point in my life where anxiety was dominating both my personal, professional, and familial relationships. I also had extreme health anxiety, which dominated a lot of my thoughts.  Since starting Lexapro, I have noticed a huge difference in the reduction of my anxiety, including my health anxiety.  I am happier and better able to connect with people (most likely because my anxiety has reduced a lot).  The pros definitely outweigh the cons I experienced. Cons I have heard that this medication can increase suicidal ideation, which is a big con.  I didn't have a huge depressive element to my anxiety, so I can't comment on the effects it has with depression Side effects: I have been having hot flushes, mainly at night Definitely increased thirst and dry mouth Some diarrhoea at the start, but that has settled Some waking up at 5am wide awake",0,10

Another thing that I have noticed is that it increased my anxiety for the first 5 days, which I account as a possible side effect. BUT, what I am sure about is that it started changing my life from day 6 already!! I feel happy most of the time and my anxiety diminished to a level that is actually close to normal.

For my depression it helps me not feel depressed as long, but I still felt almost as equally depressed as before just not everyday. And, most of the time I wasnt depressed.

Also more difficult to ejaculate. The jitters which, when you already have anxiety, will only exacerbate the problem until the side effects wear off after about a week or so.

Escitalopram,"<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 For me and other people I have suggested this medication too it has completely changed our lives for the better. Reading reviews you often see knee jerk reactions from people suffering deeply and then taking the medication and going through the up to 4 week period of feeling worse. That is a tough 4 weeks if you felt you where already at breaking point, easy to pull out the pitch fork at that time. But you're less likely to hear from the people who would tell you the polar opposite of that because once taking lexapro providing you are feeling better its easy to leave the dark world behind and return to the light.  My suggestion to anyone who has been recommended this, ignore stigma and try this for at least 4 weeks at your doctors direction. GL ML",0,39

The first week and one half was a bit disconcerting, as the heart palpitations I had increased, and my anxieties seemed to be amplified. I also developed a headache that nothing could touch, that lasted about four days. Thereafter things calmed and about week three I began to notice periods of time when I became more mellow, and my interactions with those around me seem more positive than before. Now that mellowness has expanded somewhat, though it is not consistent, nor do I feel any haziness or loss of focus when needed. No weight gain, no sexual side effects.",8,18

It was the best thing I ever did! Cipralex took 6 weeks to kick in @5mg dose (I took clonazepam to counter the increased anxiety side effects for first 2 weeks). I got brain zaps, spacey headed, sleepy and had dry mouth. It all went away within 3 weeks. I Took it for a year.. A slow wean is key to minimize coming off side effects. I did it over  4 months.

I toughed it out, and after about 6 weeks, it was like a cloud was lifted and I have felt AMAZING ever since.

Only thing is I've gained about 8kg and I cannot lose the weight. I had no side effects what so ever when I started, maybe it's because I was previously on Paxil, but I didn't have any side effects apart from weight gain with that either.

My psychiatrist was right when saying that it doesn't make you feel happy, but it slows down your brain just enough so that you can let thoughts come and go, rather than ruminating on the negative ones.

I felt like I had to start over, and the extreme lonelyness caused extreme anxiety and depression. The anxiety was 24/7 for 1.5 weeks, non stop, intense, could hardly sleep and constantly wanted to die. Had it not been for my daughter I probably would've offed myself.  After 1.5 months I felt depressed but better and decided to go back to work. Bad idea, anxiety came back with vengence and after 3 weeks I was asked by my doctor to start Escitalopram (she called it Cipralex, but the Escitalopram is a much cheaper generic one, so I got that one) Had no effect at up 15mg for 1 month. Then 1 week at 20mg YAY !",9,8

For me the side effects were feeling nauseous, insomnia (normally 1 nights average sleep and the next no sleep, constant swallowing which I think is called dry mouth and just feeling miserable for the first 3 weeks.

I went back to work and can attend social events again.  The negatives for me was how long it took for the meds to take effect (it was about 1-2 months of increased anxiety, loss of appetite, loss of sex drive, irritability) then it started to work and I increased my dosage to 15MG which is what I have been on since. I'd say it took about 4-6 months for full effects and now I still feel anxiety but can handle it better.  Other down side: if I forget my meds for a day or two I definitely feel the effects.

I didn't feel the highs of being happy nor the lows of being sad.  But after about a month, my emotions returned , and the sleepiness and diarrea subsided.

First and foremost EVERYONE is different, so everyone will react to it differently. I was prescribed it by my primary Doctor due to my severe anxiety and mild depression. Before this medication I was prescribed Celexa, but hated it. My anxiety and depression got so much worse I decided to do something about it. It came to the point where my anxiety and depression affected everyone around me and I just wasn't happy anymore.  At first taking this medication gave me some side affects. My side effects were really dry mouth, some intense dreams, and some loss of appetite. The only thing that has stuck for these few months have been the dreams. They seems SO REAL! But I can say I rather have some dreams than those scary anxiety attacks I use to get, and those depressed bed sobs. Lexapro has changed my life! Before this medication my life was hitting rock bottom. My Anxiety was so severe it took over my life. I obsessed over everything, overthought everything, felt like at any moment I was going to die. I was on edge every second. My blood pressure was always high and I'm only 24! I had this obsession of dying in a car accident, it came to a point I couldnt ride in a car with anyone else unless I was driving. If I did I would get panic attacks. My depression was also bad and also had an eating disorder. I felt like I was never going to be happy. Was never going to be happy in a relationship, or in my job, or even be able to hug my own mother again.

Those effects disappear very quickly.  Do start at 5mg and slowly increase to 10 or 20mg. Ask you doctor to supplement with Buspar XL which counteracts most Lexapro side effects and further helps control anxiety and panic attacks. I don't recommend using Lexapro without Buspar.

After a while I needed to up my dose from 10-20 and I am now feeling like I did when I first started taking lexapro.

I had a lot of social anxiety. Every single little thing would seem like such a huge task or issue. I felt completely exhausted all the time, all I wanted to do was sleep.

My resistance to stress was at rock bottom when I started taking Lexapro and it stopped my panic attacks immediately. I realized I'd been dealing with anxiety my whole life and had just thought it was normal and a part of my basic personality. The side effects at first were difficulty sleeping and a lack of appetite.  The longer I've been on this medication the more even I have felt...able to handle stress but still be myself.  I'm so much more comfortable in social situations and all of my obsessive worrying is gone. Sleep and appetite are normal now. Still feel emotions but don't lose control.,0,25

This combination has worked well for me, since the Wellbutrin has an up effect, and helps with sexual side effects. Tried to reduce the Lexapro to 5mg this fall, but had some anxiety start to return, went back to 10mg recently. Maybe just holiday stress. I'm so glad these medicines are around!

I'm not yet sure whether that's a deal breaker as I think the other SSRIs would have the same effect.,0,22

I finally went to the doctor and he put me on Lexapro. I've been taking it for approximately 6 months and I started seeing results within the 1st week. I haven't gained any weight, in fact I've lost weight and sometimes have to make myself eat. It does make me sleepy, so I take it at night. For me it has worked wonders.",0,53
Escitalopram,"<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 I've been on Lexapro for 2 years and am now weening myself off.  I am giving this medicine a relatively high rating because it saved my social and academic life in under a month of beginning treatment.  However, after being on it for about 2 years it's effects have plateaued.  I am completely emotionally neutral to any situation.  Some may like this feeling, but I do not.  Example:  I get a D on an important term paper.  Emotion: I don't care.  Example: I get an A on an important term paper.  Emotion:  I don't care.  I'd at least like to feel something from emotional stimuli.  I will either be trying a different drug or giving a completely drugless life a chance.  Good luck to you all.",0,65

I was told that it is not habit forming and that it has low side effects and works well to treat panic disorder. I started out on 10mg for 3 weeks then went up to 20mg. My side effects have been mild and have included nausea (the first few days), weight loss (which I don't mind) because of decreased appetite, mild increased sweating, and recently trouble falling asleep. All in all I am very pleased with it and have had only one panic attack in over a month. I used to have multiple ones weekly.

Escitalopram,"<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 I started Lexapro 10 mg while my mother was terminally ill - very high stress period. It was like a miracle. Totally relaxed me and got me through a rough period. I only experienced two side effects - weight gain (10 lbs) and zero sex drive. Because of the weight gain, I decided to wean myself off a few months after my mother passed away with no problems at all. Then, six months later began suffering the worst anxiety with severe panic attacks. I immediately got back on Lexapro and will try to combat the weight gain with diet and exercise. It was a good drug for me.",0,28

I have now been on Lexapro for 4 days and I am very excited of the effects already. I feel more relaxed and I don't get upset over the little things. I am actually losing weight and sleeping better.

Escitalopram,"<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 I was on Paxil and switched to Lexapro a few years back (3) and have not had many side affects. It really does calm me down so I have become a nicer person, and shrug off things that I would normally go crazy about, less shouting etc. I take 20mg. I do feel it has made me lazier and as a result I have been putting on some weight as I exercise less. It does affect orgasms which are much harder to pull off and takes incredible effort. I tried 3 times to go off the drug cold turkey, with terrible results. I just became depressed. After a few days I just went back on it again and after 15 minutes felt the glow of calm come into my body and I was normal again.  It is addictive, to quit, definitely need to decrease dose gradually.",0,61

I now find myself actually starting conversations with people - something the pre-Lexapro me could have never dreamed. I feel so much more relaxed - like a real person, finally. No side effects at all either except it definitely increases the effects of alcohol. Didn't really do much for my depression, but I think just feeling less anxious is helping it along.",0,30

I requested help for anxiety made worse by PMS. I started on 2.5mg and had scary anxiety, worse than what I was even taking it for, mild dry mouth, dizziness, and head sensations that were not quite painful but annoying. Just when I thought it was getting better, side effects seem to come and go as they please. I know that 2 weeks is not a fair amount of time to evaluate the drug completely and while my PMS was improved this month, I feel different, and not in a good way.

My Doctor initially prescribed Paxil but the side effects were horrible so she switched me to Lexapro. My symptoms gradually went away over a month. The only side effect I had was mild weight gain which I could not sweat off until I quit the medication. I stayed on Lexapro for just over a year while I also did CBT. I gradually quit over a 6-wk period with no withdrawal symptom. Lexapro litteraly saved my job, relationship and my sanity. I only have good comments to say about this drug.",0,116
Escitalopram,"<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 I found that in high stress situations, I still had some degree of anxiety (sweaty palms, holding my breath without realizing it, some shaking, etc) but overall my ability to handle anxiety evened out.  I was a lot less stressed and found decision making, dealing with my children, and talking in front of people to be much more manageable.  I was able to sleep better without waking up several times in a panic wondering what I had forgotten to do.  I stopped worrying about things.  This drug changed my life with a moderately low dose and with little to no side effects.",0,68

It gave me more anxiety and crazy chest pains.  I was on 10mg daily.,0,12
Escitalopram,"<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and was given Lexapro along with cognitive therapy. The first week Lexapro made me worse than I was originally. However, it worked wonders and has helped me immensely to get my life back in order.  I started on a light dosage at 10mg and in 4 weeks jumped to 20mg which is typical.  This combined with cognitive therapy has got me back on track.  I really didn't experience any side effects except feeling crappy when I first got on it.  Within 4 weeks it was fine.  To me it is like taking aspirin everyday now.",0,22
Escitalopram,"<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 I'm almost 40 years old and have been on 20mg Lexapro for 1 1/2 years just before the death of my mother.  The drug has been wonderful and has helped balance the stress and has limited my severe migraines.  The only concern is I gained a lot of weight and I have never had a weight problem until this drug.  The weight is settled mostly in my mid section. I am concerned with heart disease, artery problems, high cholesterol since these run in my family history.  Lexapro is amazing but factor in other health issues you could encounter on it.  I'm weighing my options to see if I am willing to risk the withdrawal effects, weight gain (I've read elsewhere it is difficult to lose the weight after going off Lexapro) or if my anxiety was because of my mother's death or everyday now.",0,19
Escitalopram,"<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 For the first week on Lexapro, I felt weird; a little lightheaded, dizzy, had insomnia and some minor stomach issues but I stuck it out and I'm so glad I did. I have been taking it for 5 weeks now. I take Lexapro around 10am now as this helps prevent insomnia at night. I feel more energetic, happier and more social. I don't feel out of control or strange or anything. No side effects now. I would highly recommend it anyone to try this.",0,103

I had chest pains from the anxiety and they also went away after a month on Lexapro. If you experience side effects in the beginning please try to stick it out it is worth it. I had some side effects (restlessness, insomnia, worsening of panic episodes, dry mouth and sweating) but they went away after 4 weeks. The only bad thing about Lexapro is the weight gain.

It wasn't until I finally had a full on panic attack (felt like a heart attack) and had to go to hospital that I was prescribed Lexapro. I did not want to accept the fact that I needed to take medicine for something psychological. I always tried to fight things with my mind. Over the past 2 years I am glad I was prescribed Lexapro.

A few hours after taking the second dose I had this wave of memories from the last year that made me go wow, I've over reacted, over thought, over cried, over expected from myself and others.  It does make me a bit sleepy so I take it before bed. My appetite is more normal now where I would eat to feel better now I am only eating when I'm hungry.
