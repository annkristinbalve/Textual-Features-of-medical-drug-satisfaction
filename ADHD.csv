Dexmethylphenidate,I have a 5 year old son. He started this medication dexmethylphenidate for his ADHD about 2 months ago. It has made him zombified &amp; he cannot complete a sentence &amp; hes very confused when trying to talk. When he does talk he talks extremely low and nobody can hear him. When he doesnt have this medication he is off the walls with his behavior. Hitting kicking screaming telling us no &amp; just extremely terrible behavior. He does not eat while on his pills &amp; he barely drinks anything. He also does not like it loud or a lot going on hed rather be in his room by himself unless I make him go out &amp; hes the same like a zombie. The dose he takes is 10MG in the morning and 10MG in the afternoon. He has lost weight but not a ton. I feel as if it makes him angry when hes not on it &amp; like he has no care in the world when it wares off. Its like this medication has med his behavior worse than when he took no medication sometimes. I wouldnt recommend this medication &amp; Im glad Im not alone.,1,0
Dexmethylphenidate,"This dexmethylphenidate is the only medication I have tried thus far for my ADHD that has had a good effect on my life. When I take the 30mg Focalin XR that is prescribed to me, I can actually think clearly, have the motivation to do the things I need to do, and it makes me feel like a normal, happy, productive member of society.  The only bad thing I can say about this treatment is that it makes my fingers and toes more sensitive to the cold, but I have never lost feeling or complete color in any of them so I believe that its not a major cause for concern at this point in time",10,0
Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 Im scrolling through reviews and a lot of what Ive been feeling recently is starting to make sense - this medicine helps me focus but I feel weak and awful while on it. It makes me shake and my anxiety spikes  Ive also been having some depression issues -  my moods stoop to a terrible level and Ive been in such a dark place at some points.  This medicine makes me feel like a zombie, it makes me shake and feel sick to my stomach  I feel bad for any other kids taking this It helps me focus but makes me feel awful  I absolutely DREAD having to take them  I have experienced depersonalization, depression, major mood swings, anxiety, derealization, and suicidal tendencies after getting on this medication  I am not self diagnosing for anxiety and depression I strongly advise watching your kids before and after having them take these pills-  Make sure your child is safe and happy.  Im sorry for my terrible grammar and typing skills-",0,3
Dexmethylphenidate,<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 Took a break then started again and on day 3 I was nausea tired,0,1
Dexmethylphenidate,I've been on Focalin XR 30mg from 15-17 and from 22-23 [now]. I only stopped taking it in that period because I lost my insurance. I also recently started taking 10mg of regular focalin around noon-1pm as I work from 3am-3:30pm doing medical screening with an hours drive each way. Typically for a regular 9-5 work day the XR was more than adequate. The 10mg gives me just enough of a boost to get through till I get home at 4:30 without keeping me up when I go to bed at 5pm. Pros: -Best focus I've ever had in my life -Nice energy boost to get me through the drive and the shift despite odd hours  Cons: -Some mild dry mouth for about an hour after taking it  -Mild shaking off the hands for about half an hour after taking  -When the first dose wears off I am slightly more tired than without it,10,0
Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 Focalin 40 mg XR. I found that that this medication was mostly ineffective. If anything it has an initial kick and wears off extremely fast. I thought it would be like adderall xr which I could feel the effects come and go throughout the day at 30 mg. With focalin its just one burst of euphoria/adrenaline/ and then you crash and feel nothing  except for the physical side effects like chest pain, rapid heart beat, muscle tenseness. I took a nap 2.5 hours after taking it which is ridiculous. It is frustrating because you don't feel the sense of focus that adderall gives. I only took it for two days before I called it quits because I did not see a benefit and decided to go back to adderall 20 mg IR. This medication did not suit me as a 27 year old grad student. I felt anxiety and panic attack symptoms with the second dose I took and I did not want to continue. It actually had a negative impact on my work input for those two days.",0,4

Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 To start off, I would not recommend taking this drug Focalin unless absolutely necessary. It definitely helped me pay attention in school, and there was a noticeable difference between days I did take it, and days I did not. However, for me at least, the side-effects outweighed the benefits. I'd been on it from the ages of 7-17, and throughout those years I noticed a complete change in behavior. Muted emotions, loss of appetite, depression, insomnia. I paid more attention in school, sure, but all of those years I'd lost important emotional development time. It's only after being off of this drug for 5 years that I realize just how emotionally stunted it had made me over the years. I'm in college now, and admittedly it would help me get better grades. But I wouldn't take it again if someone paid me to do it.",0,8
Dexmethylphenidate,"Really didn't like Focalin. It was the first medication I tried after getting diagnosed with ADHD at age 18.  Made me, a person who really enjoys food, feel sick at the thought of eating. Also made me really anxious every week or so. I'd end up feeling really motivated to do something, but too restless to get it done. Also, the crash at the end of the 8 hours is really noticeable.",2,1
Dexmethylphenidate,<b>Focalin (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 This medicine made my son so sick. He became anorexic and very nauseous.  It made him very aggressive and we had to take him off it.,0,8
Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 I am 19 year old female in college, and an athlete with extreme ADHD. I usually take Adderall Xr 20-30mg and it has helped me so much in college, I used to drink 6 cups of coffee a day just so I could focus enough to remember where I left my keys and sit down to take a test, but now adderall does that for me. FOCALIN however,  was possibly the worst experience of my life. Focalin took every bit of anxiety and sadness and threw me into several panic attacks. I am a very happy and energetic person, I have never experienced depression or anxiety like this. I didnt sleep all night and I spent most of the night sobbing uncontrollably. My heart was beating out of my chest and I couldnt think about anything but how sad and stressful everything was. I suggest to NEVER take this medication, the side effects FAR outweighed the purpose of the medication. I never felt focused or honed in.",0,3
Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 I've tried almost every single ADHD pill from Adderall to Daytrana to Ritalin to Vyanese to Concerta...Focalin is BY FAR the best for me. I am on the 10mg dose. Was originally on 30mg but my heart was beating way too fast on it. The other meds made me very angry, but this keeps me at bay, yet focused. Only con I have with this is about an hour after I take it, I have a bowel movement. I'm also the same way with coffee. I don't take it everyday and on the days where I don't I can definitely tell, but I don't have cravings.",0,5
Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 My son 12 years old and in 7th grade.  He was tested for ADD in 3rd grade by using the Quotient testing system which showed that he did not have it.  Clinical signs were there.  We tried low dosage 5-7mg of vyvanse, Adderall, Quanfacine. The worst 2 years of his life.  He did not have problems with good grades to begin with but just could not focus at school or home.  That landed him in more trouble with the teachers.  Took him off for 5th and 6th grade.   7th grade has been a nightmare.  Grades for the first time  were horrible and ALL 6 teachers said he cant focus and they became aggravated but not because he was disrespectful but cause they were tired of redirecting him.  So back to the dr we go 2nd semester. They put him on focalin xr and. Wow what a difference.  He has bumped up to 10mg.  He can tell the difference himself.  He said mom I kinda felt like a genius today instead of saying I cant do it, its to hard.  Focalin has the least amount of side effects by far.",0,14
Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 I was on  focalin XR when I was age 5 I think it is a good medication learning wise, but at the same time it drains you it takes your happiness and joy away its like you are completely numb to joy, when Im off of it I cant focus but I am always so joyous and happy, when Im on it I focus perfectly but I am very zombied out and it is a horrible feeling",0,9
Dexmethylphenidate,<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 Today was my first day on Focalin. I took 10 milligrams and it did absolutely nothing. I feel zero difference. The only difference I feel is the fact that I have a headache and sore throat.,0,3

Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 Our son was diagnosed with ADHD and Focalin XR has changed his life for the better.  He is able to focus at school now and he's performance, grades and happiness have all evolved.  It was with heavy hearts we finally relinquished using meds because of the fear of what it might do long term and seeing zombied-out kids who no longer have personalities.  Focalin didn't do this at all.  Our son is still very much himself but without the stress of struggling so hard to focus. It has changed our lives. Teachers, coaches and family have all noticed wonderful outcome.",0,20
Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 45 year old male with depression and ADD.  I started with Focalin 20mg XR once a day, then 5 years later my doc added a regular 10mg dose in the afternoon. This has been a fantastic medicine for me. Would not be able to perform at work without it. Two negative side effects (but the benefits outweigh them): 1) Intestinal discomfort and bowel movement like clock work about 60-90 minutes after I take it in the morning. I have to avoid scheduling meetings for that time. 2)  meth dick  or  meth penis  which basically is caused by reduced blood flow to appendages. Get cold hands and feet too. Luckily it doesnt impact size of erection since blood is flowing then. Its just ego bruising when shrinkage occurs. On the weekends I skip the 20mg dose and take 10mg around noon so I dont have to take two doses, also giving my body and brain a rest from the stimulant. My appendages feel warmer too. But I am happy my doc prescribed this to me. Absolutely huge life changer for me.",0,14
Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 Ive had ADHD for a very long time and didnt start taking Focalin until (11th grade) I tried other stimulants in middle school but gave up because disliked the way they made me feel. Focalin does its job. It helps me focus and get work done, however, I do get shaky and anxious while on the drug. My appetite is also effected. You just have to decide if the side-effects are worth the outcome.",0,9
Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 Please please do not use focalin if you have depression or anxiety, or prone to addiction. I have severe ADD and I was prescribed focalin 2 years ago. When I would come down off of it, it made me so unbearably sad and near suicidal so I would take more just to not kill myself. This led to a severe addiction that nearly gave me brain damage. Please be safe. Good grades arent worth the pain this drug put me through.",0,26
Dexmethylphenidate,"I was previously on Concerta, which just made me anxious and even more scatter brained (instead of focusing on school work, my brain would wander and hyper focus on other things). Focalin definitely helped my anxiety, and it allows me focus on the important things (like school work/conversations). I don't take it during weekends, or even sometimes during the week if I don't have much to do which works out for me. If I did that on concerta, it would just increase my anxiety when I went back on it. Also, since it only lasts for about 8 hours, it doesn't cause any sleeplessness later on in the evening. I even experience less of a dry mouth than when I was on concerta!  Bad side effect for me was mainly weight loss, but I got over that by forcing myself to eat lunch, or eating a big breakfast/big dinner.",8,2
Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 I've taken it on and off since I was in highschool (I'm 26 now). Generally 5-10mg has worked best for me. It helps me a lot when there are tasks I need extra focus on, and a lower dose can help in social situations. I found it to be helpful for school, and more recently at work. The worst side affect for me is a loss of appetite. I find that I have to totally guess how hungry I am and force it down so I don't get brain fog. It relieves anxiety in that I can finally do what I need to, but it raises anxiety in general. I try to take it as little as possible, and haven't experienced any issues taking it sporadically. Just keep the dose low.",0,11
Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 For me, Focalin has had way more negative effects than positive. My doc started me off with 10mg in the morning and then another 10mg in the afternoon. Now Im on 20mg in the morning, 20 mg in the afternoon. It helps my concentration and ADHD issues for maybe the first 2 hours or less after each dose, but then from there, it causes terrible anxiety, depression. It makes things worse than actually helping when it starts wearing off (which is very quickly). Overall, I don't like Focalin at all. It not only comes with mental side effects like I mentioned but also physical side effects as well such as: shortness of breath, rapid heart beat, constant feeling like I have to urinate but cant, fatigue, etc. Its been over 3 months and it hasnt helped my ADHD consistently or effectively anywhere close to stabilizing and treating it. Please consider other ADHD meds before going with Focalin for you / your childs ADHD problems. It certainly hasnt been the answer for me.",0,20
Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 The first day I took Focalin XR, it worked fantastic and I had so much energy and confidence was really feeling like myself again. 2nd day of taking it, it was ok wasnt as good as the first day. Then the third day I felt no difference at all. Made me feel probably worse than when I was off of it. Was extremely exhausted had no effects at all. So I called my doc and he told me to start taking 2 (20mg each) and it did ok I felt the energy but literally no focus at all. Wouldnt recommend this to anyone may work ok for some but its a good chance it wont.",0,3

Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 Focalin does the trick in getting you less scatter-brained and it helps with focus, but be sure you are only ADHD and  aren't also autistic and/or have motor tics/nervous tics because it is an amphetamine stimulant drug. There it might make you more fidgety if you fidget or have nervous tics out of anxiety and over-stimulation. I'm on the spectrum and this drug makes my repetitive motor movements worse.",0,10
Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 Long story short I was previously on Vyvanse 40mg a day, and I decided I wanted to try Focalin XR. Before that I was on Concerta and absolutely hated it, when I was a kid I apparently did very well on it, but not anymore. So I decided to give Focalin XR a try, and it works very well! The only 2 issues I have is the questionable quality of the release beads among certain generic manufacturer, and the severity of the crash.",0,5
Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 Ive never commented on a drug before, but I feel compelled to here due the number of negative reviews. Focalin has completely given me a life... I went from not being able to function to a person who is optimistic, looks forward to taking on the day, carries out tasks to completion and enjoys doing so.

Never again.",0,6
Dexmethylphenidate,<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 Whenever I take this medication I feel bored of everything. I will just sit and do nothing instead of doing things I normally enjoy.

Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 I switched to Focalin after taking Adderall XR for about 5 years. Adderall XR worked but I thought that there must be something better, so my doctor put me on Focalin. Today has been my third day on the new medication and I feel awful. As someone who has acid reflux, Focalin worsened by heart burn and caused me to gag every 10 minutes for no reason. Folcalin barely helped me focus during my class and I couldn't drive because of how weak I was and how much I shook. This medicine has given me diarrhea and constant headaches. Needless to say I will be going back to Adderall XR.",0,13
Dexmethylphenidate,<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 My 14 yr old son took Focalin for 2 yrs. He ended his own life while on this med. We were never told that suicidal ideation is a possible side effect. It is now recently listed as a side effect. I would have never given this to my child had I known. Children can not always express themselves and dont connect dark feelings with a medication they are taking. Please be aware with children on these types of drugs! Heartbroken mom,0,60
Dexmethylphenidate,<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 My son with ADHD used to run around and be so loud and excited but now on the Fovalin XR he is calm quite and it feels like he is not here.

Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 I was prescribed this as my first treatment for ADHD when I was (finally) diagnosed at age 18. It helped me calm down a little, I could go to work and not feel the urgent need to go home. But then I would start crying at work, in public. I would cry to my parents until they couldnt handle me anymore. The comedown from when it wears off was HORRIBLE for me. I have GAD, but the anxiety I experienced was nothing like that. It was acute fear and dread that came rushing in for the next 4-6 hours after the meds wore off. Also I should mention I lost feeling in my hands and feet. I tried taking it for about a month but it wasnt worth it. Four years later I still havent found something that works.",0,6

I have been taking medications since I was in the first grade, and I can definitely tell the difference when Im on this medication.

Dexmethylphenidate,<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 I took this medicine it made me have suicidal thoughts. It is awful. It made me irritable and I could not get sleep.

Dexmethylphenidate,<b>Focalin (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 We started my son on Focalin once doctors felt his anxiety was under control with Prozac. Big mistake.

Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 These other comments are crazy and not relative to this drug vs others.  I have taken almost every type of ADD med and this is the best by far.  Methylphenidate has left and right branch isomers.  The right branch helps with ADD and the left branch causes stimulant jittery side effects.  Focalin/dexmethylphenidate is just the right branch.  Once you get your dosing right (I take 25mg XR in morning and 10mg IR in afternoon) then it is the best.  It is like a cure for ADD as opposed to taking a stimulant.  By far the lightest side effects.  It is less hard on the cardiovascular system than regular methylphenidate, and does not create neurotoxins like many of the amphetamine family drugs i.e. Adderall.  As long as you make yourself eat on it, then it is not noticeable.",0,25

He started taking Focalin and guanfacine at 6yrs old helped tremendously. 2 months to start working over summer. It's not a miracle drug it just helps keep him focused.

Dexmethylphenidate,"<b>Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 I've always had ADD but didn't start trying to get help with it until I was about to start college. I tried Adderall for 2 weeks and became unable to eat and felt constantly awful. It was obvious Adderall wasn't working for me, so my doctor recommend Focalin XR, and I really can't recommend it enough. About a week after taking Focalin (10mg twice daily) I went from that to being able to work without distraction for at least 4 hours. I could focus on all the things I enjoyed for longer periods. I was no longer asking my friends and others I'm sorry could you repeat that? like I was before constantly. It has also helped me with my depression, I feel so much more motivated and I'm able to finally organize things without it feeling like a chore.

She also could barely look at you in the eye when you were telling her something-- it was like she was always in another world. She also only ever felt satisfied by TV and videos and all other activities were too boring to hold her attention. I was stressed that she felt so out of control.

After finding out that I have Mitral Valve Prolapse with regurgitation, I obviously was weened off this medication.

My daughter was placed in a behavioral center that could help her and she has not took anymore ADHD medication since that day.

Unlike other though I would not say it calms me down I feel like it actually stresses me out more.  When I take this I'm more serious and easily annoyed and I can't relax.  I have also found that my appetite drops off and that I don't sleep very deeply.

We have seen as many others have said that the medicine seems to wear off about the time they get home from school.  What we do is they have a small snack and take a small afternoon dose of 5 to 10 mg of regular Focalin to help them get to their homework and evening activities. If it is a no homework day or no activity day we opt to not take this medicine in the evening and we do not take the evening dose on the weekends. We do take the morning dose every day of the week.

He is supposed to take 5mg non extended release after school, however, I hardly give that to him anymore.  I sometimes break the 5mg pill in half and just have him take 2.5mg to focus on his homework, if I see him struggling.

Finally, after a couple of years suffering with this Ritalin I talked with my doctor about trying a new medicine called Focalin XR when I was 13 and I am almost 18 now.

This was a scary experience I got dizzy almost passed out and couldn't tell you what 1 1 was. It was horrible  to say the least. I discontinued the Focalin and tried Adderal.

But once you have the main issues resolved, since the drug is used to treat ADHD and Tourettes, the depression sees no competition and just jumps into the lime light.

I've been feeling very anxious lately, I'm not sure if that's due to jumping down from 6 to 4 mg yesterday or not having slept for more than 4 hours per day for the last few weeks.

It initally improved working memory (easier to take time to perform tasks such as not jumping ahead while reading), then, as it works on 2A receptors, created a DECREASED DESIRE to perform the tasks. Essentially, it lowers NE. So, lower motivation, which nearly completely negates the easier task performance. THIS IS A COMMON THREAD. Therefore, works better in conjunction w/ stims. It also created depersonalization. Finally, it caused a unique mixed episode w/ grandiosity and irritabilility, but psychomotor retardation and grumpiness.

I began benzodiazapine medication early in my college years. Eventually the benzos stopped working and my anxiety was even worse. I started guanfacine and really began to notice a difference.

She started on a Friday evening and by Saturday afternoon she was vomitting. I initially chalked it up to a stomach virus until days later the pyschiatric advised to immediately discontinue as the vomitting was an adverse reaction.

Of course I should have known it would be too good to be true because after 4-6 weeks the positive effects have subsided. He's back to losing everything, fussying about everything and just generally not listening. The doctor says its placebo effect but I don't buy that.

I would lose control and not be able to handle his constant stubbornness and defiance he is a beautiful energetic boy with an amazing personality but just needed to be taken down a few notches.

The first day I took it right before bed and woke up feeling lethargic. But every day since got progressively better. I was more calm, experienced less anxiety and mood swings, was able to focus and handle stresses more easily, and because I wasn't so anxious or emotional I wasn't overeating.

We added group ADHD therapy for him at a local clinic with other boys his age which also helped hugely. My suggestion to parents is please do not just rely on a medicine. Find a good counselor that will help you and your child by giving you tools to use in every day life, like learning to patiently wait, be a gracious loser, etc.  As far as the Intuniv goes..

We give it to him between 4-7 pm before bed and with food. He still gets a little dizzy some days but we also note that if he doesn't drink enough fluids that seems to be more prevalent.

I went to table tennis and was just a zombie.  I was asleep on my feet and couldn't wait for class to end instead of being my normal happy active self during class.

It does help with focus, it helps with impulse control, it helps with a general overall euphoric feeling and it can cause you to lose a lot of weight.

It will cause tremors, shakes, and irritability, again, eat food. Make sure to stick to a 2000 calorie diet AT LEAST. May cause muscle fatigue and extreme soreness, stay hydrated, make sure of this.  Some say it causes better grades in school, well, to an extent. It just makes you write a lot. Eat Eat Hydrate And maybe take melatonin to help promote rest. I warned and entertained you.",7,31

Adderall,"Diagnosed ADD 18 y/o, on and off Adderall IR since then. Too high a dose causes psychosis...be forewarned. I used to be on 30mg 3x/day, now I'm leary of taking more than 2.5mg 2x/day. Maybe it builds up in the brain, so be sure to take breaks from it often. I notice the side effects outweigh the benefits at higher doses....irritability, zombie-like come-down. My insurance only covers this and Ritalin, so I'm stuck with bad side-effects.",4,16
Adderall,"Adderall is literally the only THING Period that I have tried that has improved my life in the slightest (I have ADD/Treatment-Resistant Depression ) - I got my Bachelors degree in Health &amp; Psychology, I tried EVERY supplement herb, nootropic, etc. I'm commenting here is because of all the people saying how it drained them, or over time began making them feel worse - you need to educate yourself - one of the most important being, be SURE to be supplementing with TYROSINE, literally daily (tyrosine converts into Dopamine - like how 5-HTP converts to Serotonin) just like how SSRI's eventually poop out and just stop working (because they've used up the bodies natural serotonin) Adderall will eventually poop out on you, stop working, yet even worse when this happens, the more you take the WORSE you feel because its like revving an engine with no gasoline left in it!!! Theres plenty more to look into but even just taking Tyrosine makes a HUGE difference!",8,69
Adderall,I do not recommend anyone taking Adderall. I was unable to eat or sleep while taking this medication. It caused severe stunting of my growth.,1,6
Adderall,"I have always known that I had ADD. However, I was in grad school, and I was studying for up to 10-12 hours a day. I found myself reading and re-reading and was having a hard time retaining information, because I couldn't stay focused. I would study for hours. Long story short, for my master's degree, I had to take practice timed test for NP boards, I failed it. My instructor told me to get tested for ADHD,  and get on medications. I did, and it was the best thing I have ever done, and wish I did it sooner, it cut my studying by half, because I'm very focused. I didn't have to request extra time for my NP boards, and I passed with time to spare. I have no side effects; incr. HR, BP, I eat and exercise, and don't take it late in afternoon to avoid insomnia. I only take it when I study and not everyday.  I believe it's about making the drug work for you and not let the drug control you.  Medication holidays are great to do.",10,27
Adderall,"If it wasnt for Adderall I would be a basket case no questions asked. I'm 55 been on it since 2014 on an everyday basis. I'll take a day off every so often, but it's a rare occasion. My Blood Pressure is 122/74- pulse 64 when moving around normally. Resting my BP is lower along with the pulse rate. If you are relatively healthy heart wise no problems. I know one guy who's pushing 76 years old and he's still taking his prescribed dosage.",10,29
Adderall,My son developed tics and we stopped the Adderall medication. Tics remain and one day he hit his head until no hair was there. He also now has blood in his stool no one can explain. Hmmm well permanent  damage isnt worth the education we are providing now. I would rather buy a franchise than a college degree.,1,4
Adderall,"I've been on and off Adderall IR for the last year. When I'm on Adderall the first 3 months is amazing! I feel highly attentive and motivated. I have to take sleep meds because I'm so wired. The negative is the crash I feel by 6pm. It's like I transform into Angry Smurf - no longer talkative or cheerful and forgot about sex -- my libido shut down. My greatest battle is with food.  I am constantly hungry and when I eat the meds seem to lose its potency therefore causing me to skip meals. I built a tolerance rather quickly on this stuff and it lost its efficacy. IN ANY CASE, DO NOT INCREASE YOUR DOSAGES. Instead take a break from Adderall and try another drug for a couple of months.  This drug is not meant for long term use. Just few month. anything longer is just going to create a monster out of you.",6,17
Adderall,"Adderall seemed to really help me at first. After about six months though I ran into problems. I started to feel nervous, had sleeping issues, loose stool, sweaty pits, and ultimately gained a dependency where I craved for me to always be on it and feared the comedown. The final straw was when I fell into my seasonal depression and the it made it worse. I started to feel like an emotionless robot, knew had to leave it. Overall the negative side effects far out-weighed the positive ones. I'll also note it has been several months since my last dose and I still don't feel completely like myself. Sometimes it is harder for me to get up and going than it has ever been, and my seasonal depression didn't end in March like usual, this is the first sunny June I've been depressed like this. I suggest other alternatives to your ADHD, this drug is toxic, very addictive, and can change you. I never felt right taking it, I'll do anything else to combat my ADHD after experiencing it long term.",3,14
Adderall,"Adderall IR destroyed my mental, emotional, and physical health. I started out in high school with XR, switched to vyvanse, and everything was working fine. I became severely dependent on this medication. I could not get out bed without it; I was miserable if I was not on it; I isolated myself from everyone; and it led me to other addictions which I will not discuss on here. My grades were going  down the toilet ( I could not complete any work without it), and I started buying it from the streets. I had to go to inpatient rehab for this medication. I started a 12 step program and for 6 months I have been off this medication. I feel more balanced with certain coping skills (community outreach, yoga, meditation). Please be warned Adderall IR is equivalent to methamphetamine (I talked to many addiction specialists, psychologists, and social workers).",0,21
Adderall,"Adderall is an excellent medicine. More psychiatric medicines should be stimulants. I notice some positive changes when it is increased that I saw were necessary. Furthermore, it's easy to tell when a further increase needs to occur in order to fully treat ADHD for myself. It's the least expensive ADHD medicine I have found. It also worked the best for me.",10,17
Adderall,"Started with Adderall then to Straterra, then Vyvanse, then Medafinil and now back to Adderall, which  works for my ADHD.",0,5
Adderall,This med really helps me focus!!,9,14
Adderall,"Read all the comments about Adderall being an amphetamine. It's a mixed bag. Everyone who has ADHD has different levels. Talking too much or losing weight, lower dosage. Comments about generic differences is true. I have ADHD, panic attacks, agoraphobia, chronic fatigue. Started in 1991 with anxiety. Tried every medication. I had developed a chemical imbalance. I'd rather have lost both legs. People have zero compassion for mental health issues. On Adderall XR 30mg daily for 12 years. I'm 64. I wanted to try 10mg IR so I can manage it better. Use less. For 2 years no insurance &amp; generics didn't exist. Cost $475 a month. Another script cost me $900! It was either bankruptcy or sell my house. Don't believe in bankruptcy; sold house. When your paying $940 a month child support, $1000 in house payments, $1,400 a month in meds with no insurance, what else can you do? And I detest dead beat parents. It truly helps. Go with the lowest dose that works for you.",8,36
Adderall,"Been on Adderall for 5 years now, 15mg twice daily. Started on 10mg 2x daily but the lower doses are associated with aggressive behaviors. Is it a flawless savior? Do I still struggle at times with ADHD? Absolutely! Medications, i.e. insulin, all have side effects. As a patient, you must ask yourself if the side effects outweigh the benefits.  I refused treatment until age 32 which has been beneficial to my physical health. If you are at the mercy of ADHD, I strongly advise you to use some of the new apps with or without meds. Daily for the 1st 3 weeks is simply miraculous.  Lastly, the world or your coworkers don't need to know about your diagnosis. ADHD is still stigmatized as a disorder that only stupid people have. My 1st RN job I was viciously bullied once word got out about my ADHD!! By my fellow RNs!! Now I make more than a Nurse Practitioner!! #Strength",7,58
Adderall,"I've read some of the comments comparing this medication to 'street meth.' That is simply not true and further stigmatizes Adult ADHD, since many still inaccurately claim it's something you grow out of. Well, it isn't and my childhood ADHD went untreated and I could barely function at school. Since taking a combo of Adderall and Wellbutrin, my brain and my life is no longer a disorganized mess. As a kid, I was an untreated C+ student and as an adult I have a PhD. I regret the years I wasn't helped. Medication plus cognitive behavior therapy plus Adult ADD support groups = a better me. If the medicine doesn't work for you, that is your individual response but it doesn't represent all of us.",9,104
Adderall,I'm prescribed the 30mg tablets and I couldn't be happier! I've been taking this medicine for years and its very effective. 10/10,10,39
Adderall,"Adderall (Amphetamine) will seem fantastic the first time it is prescribed.  But as the years go by, and tolerance increases, you will need more. It also down regulates dopamine in the brain  (which eventually  means that it has been associated with dopamine depletion in the strital area of the brain and frontal cortex) Dopamine effects pleasure.  When it becomes low (the brain will compensate by lowering dopamine when taking Amphetamine, because Adderall increases it) When this happens you will need to continue taking it or you may experience what is called anhedonia  (Look that up) This is a very dangerous drug that can permanently change brain chemistry",0,45
Adderall,All the generics ate horrible.  Teva who acquired barr has not improved. The brand is teva- generic does not work. I want something comparable to original Barr. I'm struggling and drowning back into depression -  generics are not the same. FDA doing nothing to help all of us that ate struggling,0,54
Adderall,"I'm a 21 yr old who suffers from extreme ADD and Social Anxiety. I've found that Adderall 20 mgs IR 3 times daily to be a life saver for my ADD and social life. I actually go out and can maintain friendships/relationships. I've tried Focalin (D-methylphenidate), Ritalin (racemic form methylphenidate), Concerta (Mph er), etc and Adderall beats them all by far. I started out on 10mgs twice a day and have found this dosage is the most effective at keeping my moods stable.",9,28
Adderall,"I tried adderall first at age 17 (15mg a day), it helped a couple hours after I took it, but about 3 hours later I'd get extremely depressed and have depressing thoughts, then a couple hours later it'd just go away. This happened every time and I went off it shortly after. At 19 I tried it again at 20mg a day. Same good feelings for about 3 hours, and then a crash. However, this time the bad feelings weren't as intense and I didn't have depressing thoughts. I did experience more anxiety though, and the depression was still bad enough for me to dread taking the meds. I'm trying focalin now but I've only taken it once so I can't compare them yet.",6,15
Adderall,I was prescribed Adderall 5mg in the morning to start for ADD not ADHD. I am 21 years old. After a couple months I got up to 20mg daily because the lower doses weren't helping. Make sure to eat something before you take it because if I took it before breakfast I wouldn't eat all day. After 4 months on Adderall 20mg daily it is not helping anymore and if anything made my ADD a lot worse. I'd be in the middle of a conversation and just totally blank. Started taking a lot of effort to think anymore. It also became really hard to do much of anything if I didn't take it. It also made me sweat profusely and gave me very dry and pimply skin. It worked well for a while when I didn't take it every day but when I changed jobs I started taking it daily and it's awful. If you are prescribed this don't take it daily like it's a maintenance drug or it'll fry your brain!!!,6,11
Adderall,"AHDH medications sucks.They don't treat ADHD believe me. They just delay it till the crash comes and you feel 40 times more worse.They have  destroyed the lives of hundreds of people due to prolonged use. They are just street meth.Believe me I have ADHD and the best medicine I would suggest are a non-stimulants like welbutrin and strattera.If they didn't work for you then never ever use stimulants they will ruin your life. Just rely on adaptogens eg rhodiola, ginseng, good diet, exercise and meditation. If study is a problem for you then use you hyperfocus and study something that you are interested in.You may have found some good reviews about these  stimulants however these people are new and they are unaware of there consequences. I have tried stimulants for 15 years so I am confident and sure about what I say.",1,36
Adderall,"I have been diagnosed when I was in ,1st grade but parents were against medicating their child. Big mistake, now in my early 30's I  have been on 20mgs twice a day and they put me in an almost sedated comfortable mindset where my mind can focus on one thing and not twenty at a time. As soon as my Dr put me on this med I could work and attend College, it's let me utilize the intellect that I could never use and will be going into Graduate program for Psychology next semester. Those people with ADHD without  any medication just use it how you are directed and it can change your life without changing who you are and how you act as a person.",10,44
Adderall,"Im a 21 year old female. Adderall helped me focus, be on time, stay organized. However, as time passed I noticed the negative impact. I had weight loss, irritability, my anxiety was worse, dry skin, dry mouth, was not feeling like myself. I developed insomnia too. This was only on 20 mg a day. I took it as prescribed. The worst part was when I tried to quit taking it after I was switched to Vyvanse, which I felt even worse on. I ended up in the hospital having a panic attack the first time I tried to stop taking it. The second time I tried to quit I had even more withdrawal symptoms, paranoia, panic attacks, vomiting. Stimulants are not worth it.",1,20
Adderall,"Was diagnosed with ADHD at 18 years old. I was prescribed, and am taking Adderall 20mg XR. This drug makes me feel like an emotionless zombie at times. My anxiety is fluctuating a lot and my mood is constantly changing. I like to go out late sometimes but when it wears off I dont have any energy to do so. Friends and family have become increasingly less important it seems. I have minor scoliosis and it makes my back pain a lot worse at times. This drug definitely allows me to focus and get ahead. At the end of the day I dont know if its worth it though. Might need a lower dose.",5,16
Adderall,"Makes daily life possible. I was diagnosed in 3rd grade with ADHD. Poor grades and constantly being sent to the principal for class disruptions was getting ridiculous. Started on  Ritilan. No more principal and straight A's. Now in my 30's and on Adderall I successfully taught myself computers, reading electrical schematics and building whatever is called for. Pretty much whatever I wanted to learn.",10,22
Adderall,"I'm not entirely sure if ADHD and bipolar intersect, or if they correctly diagnosed me by being both, but that being said, I was prescribed adderall at age 15. It definitely did the job. I personally enjoy being hyper so it was alien to me. It enables me to not only hear people but listen and comprehend. It stops impulsive behavior. Provides almost sedated state. You just float along. I feel like it made me want to be quiet and polite. Now I take lamictal and seroquel. If you have ADHD do yourself a favor and look up mania. Very similar.",5,13
Adderall,I have Myotonic Muscular Dystrophy (MMD)/Rheumatic Disease  and Adderall IR has been incredible in balancing out the effects of my pain management medication for my rheumatic disease - to the point where I have cut my pain mgt med in 1/2 due to my increased activity. I'm engaged in my life again and I've found a happy balance :),10,12
Adderall,"I finally got diagnosed when I was 40. I was in college and just couldn't focus or comprehend my classes. I thought there was something wrong my head. I've been abused for a very long time. I went to my counsellor and suggested I get tested for ADHD. I was very relieved it wasn't head problems. I was diagnosed with ADHD. I suffered 40 years with all the symptoms but never thought about ADHD. When I was put on Adderall I couldn't believe the difference. My grade point was 3.67. I was very proud of myself. I've been taking it ever since. 30mg twice a day. People can tell when I'm not on it, big difference. My insurance didn't cover it. So I was paying over $200 My insurance started paying last yr. THANK YOU FOR READING MY STORY.",10,60
Adderall,"I started on concerta fo rADHD and had poor results, it made me feel out of touch, I started adderrall a week ago at 20 mg twice a day and I have anxiety and feel some focus. I am wondering if 20 mg is too low a dose and need to go up.",0,10

Adderall,it has helped me with my disability.,10,14
Adderall,"This drug completely ruined my life.  I started taking the drug when I was 12..till about 25. Everything I have done academically has been due to adderall. I have a degree in I/T and am working on a civil eng. masters degree. Don't get it confused, you can be fine for a year or even years on this drug..but it will catch up to you. After I quit taking itI  was back to a 12 year old academically and professional performance wise. It made my real ADHD 10x worse w/o the drug and gave me crippling anxiety. I quit taking it and developed a cocaine problem then a drinking problem that almost killed me. I attribute each of these addictions to being on legal speed for 13 years..It's speed - there is  no way around it.",1,26

Adderall,"My 9 years old nephew took this for a while. It helped with focus, but made him extremely angry and argumentative. Also, he refused to sleep at night unless he was in the same room as his grandmother.

Adderall,"For me Adderall has changed my life remarkably for the good; without Adderall I wouldn't be able to work 40 hours a week like I do as well as going to school full-time. Yes it may be a amphetamine and  produce similar euphoric highs  to meth and MDMA, however it is far different as far as when it is broken down chemically. For those who have little knowledge in chemistry, just one small change in the chemical structure to a drug that may seem so insignificant can actually change the drug dramatically when it comes to the side effects. Adderall is a very useful drug and provides many benefits with much less side effects then the other not so good drugs in its class.",10,50
Adderall,"works very good for energy, focus and a feeling of well being.  I didn't feel depressed at all.  It kept me focused unlike  when I was without I couldn't sit still for 2 minutes. Good overall.   It left my heart racing a little but I took a Xanax and it all balanced out.",9,19
Adderall,"Hi, I was tried to be put on Ritalin when I was 5 and it simply wasnt gonna happen w my parents.  So I continued school and still had c and d grades.  I went to a Dr, did all these tests and said I have ADD/ADHD\ w anxiety disorder.  Which was from all the MDMA abuse.  So I am on 30 mg IR adderall (the ones with the 30 on em) only ones that dont make my mouth dry and 2mg xanax 4 times a day.  Let me say I wake up everyday excited to go to work.  I used to be a hardcore tablet junkie and now since I take these two I dont drink and I dont do illegal drugs.  These two rxs Were a match made in heaven.  I take 2 green bars and 1 adderall in the morning and Im flying at work in the IT/ software field.  These two have saved my life. Best combo",8,25
Adderall,"I would like to first say that my experience with Adderall was overall successful, it most definitely helped my concentration and ability to focus. However, there are some side effects that I think are worth noting. I had minimal anxiety prior to taking this medication (only when traveling). My anxiety dramatically increased to the point where I was put in therapy and almost took a medical leave from work. (I quit taking the medication once I realized it was a significant contributing factor - although not completely to blame) I had a very dry mouth while prescribed, which actually ended up leading to cavities according to my dentist.  Noticeable lower back pain &amp; problems sleeping (both are alleviated once you quit taking the meds)",7,13
Adderall,"This medication is absolutely amazing for those who really suffer from ADHD. You will experience side effects such as, loss of appetite, loss of sleep, hyperactivity, dry mouth and dehydration, but they go away with time. There is a right dosage for everyone. Try to find your dosage and genetic brand that works for you, and with proper nutrition it will change your life! I've suffered from ADHD since I was a child. I was never able to focus or finish tasks. I would do so much better in life, in every aspect of it, if discovered this medication earlier in life! But like a lot of people on here say, better late than never! I am now on 15mg IR twice a day. Give it a try, just do it right!",0,33
Adderall,"I used to take Adderall.  My current doctor told me that Adderall is actually amphetamine and that while amphetamine will work for ADHD, it damages dopamine cells by releasing the dopamine inside the cell. She also said that there is increasing evidence that amphetamines increase risk for parkinson's disease even when it is used as directed.",1,26
Adderall,"When I first started taking it, it helped me immensely with my ADHD.  Pretty quickly, however, it stopped working. For one thing, it gives me crazy mood swings. It really amps me up at first, and I get super euphoric and happy for two hours, and then I feel awful and anxious and depressed. It actually potentiates my ADHD symptoms.  It makes me extremely thirsty all the time, so I keep having to leave class to go use the bathroom or fill up my water bottle. Adderall makes it harder for me to appreciate the beauty of nature. I feel less in touch with my emotions when I take it. I understand that Adderall helps people a lot of the time, so it's worth a shot. But it didn't help me AT ALL. In fact, it probably made things worse.",3,25
Adderall,"I have  been diagnosed with ADD . I have always pushed myself to get good grades and to take as many AP and honors classes as I can handle. I enjoy learning about new things; however, my lack of focus got in the way of my learning. It bothers me when people say ADD/ADHD is made up. I know that people who don't have this disorder can't truly understand what it's like. Without adderall my mind is foggy and I can't take the fog away to learn about the things that I love. All my friends know that I have a strong passion for physics and astronomy, but it's very hard for me to pick up a book without forgetting most of what I read after I finished it. On adderall I feel like the fog fades always and my mind is like a clear sunny day. Oh how I wish that I didn't have to take this every day and just naturally be as focused. I am just an 18 year old who is trying to pursue her dreams, but without this medication I'm not sure how I can get through college to learn what I love. I can now look through my telescope at the stars without the clouds getting in the way.",9,90
Adderall,"Such an amazing contribution to the pharmaceutical world. So much better than its ugly step sisters, such as Ritalin and Vyvanse. Adderall steals the show every time. 30mg/day does the trick. Been on it for 12 years, I've taken personal breaks for tolerance. I've never had any type of withdrawal or come downs at the end of the day. This drug has the ability to put me to sleep when I take it, honestly; and that's because my dissociation (caused by my ADHD) causes my anxiety to skyrocket. But when I take my adderall, I am able to focus on reality, making my anxiety disappear for a few hours. Calms me  down. Relief is a blessing.",10,65
Adderall,"I am 51, and have been on Adderall for 15 years. I take 20mg twice a day. It helps me concentrate, and stay focused. I skip taking it for one day every week, this helps me see where the Adderall helps in my life, and was suggested by my doctor to help my body not build a tolerance to Adderall. At this time I personally don't  believe Adderall is addicting, when taken properly. While on vacation, I went a week without it, and never felt any withdrawal's? from the Adderall.  I keep my Adderall, and other med's in a metal lock box, that locks onto a shelf in my fridge, because people do abuse Adderall.",10,57
Adderall,"I have been taking 2- 10mg IR tablets each day for about a month. I have noticed a significant difference at how well I perform at school since I've been on adderall. I have many honors and AP classes, which  always have a big work load. Each day I had to struggle with my ADD and having to look over the material numerous times. I am now able to focus and have confidence in my classes. Usually I am the last person taking a test and now I am one of the first people done because I am finally able to focus.  Negatives- as adderall wears off I feel anti-social, weak, agitated, and slightly depressed the positives definitely out weigh the negatives  ADD is hard to deal with and finally being able to focus means so much to me",9,31
Adderall,"I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia over two years ago, have been struggling with it for about 7. Recently went to a psychiatrist because my pain doctor and pcp suggested it because of me complaining about concentration and fatigue issues. I have only been on this a short time but so far it's been A LIFE SAVER. I was started on a low dose of course just 10mg once a day IR. I could easily take 3 of these a day. My pain doctor recently put me on the lowest dose of a butrans patch and it's made a huge difference but my energy was still gone and I still struggled (I only worked on average 20 hours a week because doing much more has been too hard and I have an easy job in an office ). This adderall may save my life I'd write more but it won't let me",10,28
Adderall,"I started taking Adderall when I was 26 y/o and it was AMAZING for about 2 years. My dose started out at 30mg/day in the beginning and after 2 years was up to 60mg/day (30 mg IR twice daily). I started getting increasingly paranoid, losing, what seemed like, more and more sleep with each passing month. I kept thinking that I was seeing red and blue lights on my walls at night, which made me think the cops were after me outside. Even though I didn't do anything that would require police assistance. Until one day when I lost my mind, literally. I was taken by ambulance to the hospital and put on a 72 hour psychiatric hold for which I ended up staying at the hospital almost 2 week. Diagnosed with amphetamine induced schizoaffective disorder!!!",1,51
Adderall,"I stopped taking this medication 6 years ago because I built up a tolerance to it. But, it seriously was the best thing to ever happen to me. I've always had untreated ADHD and when I finally received treatment, I flourished. Now, after 6 years I am giving it a try again. So far it's working great. The two things I don't like about Adderall is that I talk WAY too much, share WAY too much information. In fact, I call up family members and talk to them to death.I had to write myself a note and tape it to the phone to not call or text anyone! And the second thing is the comedown, by the time the medication wears off, I am drained!",9,69
Adderall,This drug works great at first until you need more and more to focus. Stay away from this med if you don't truly have ADHD or you have hypertension.,4,25
Adderall,"While not perfect, this drug helped me achieve around an 80% improvement in my focus, attention, and ability to see tasks through to the end.  I take 20mg IR in the morning and 20mg early in the afternoon.  I was never diagnosed with A.D.D when I was a kid likely because I barely went to see doctors as a child.  I used illicit drugs my whole life until it caused me to almost kill myself.  After being clean for a year, I noticed my problems persisted with attention, focus, and finishing tasks.  After seeing a Psychiatrist and getting a proper test/diagnosis,  I'm grateful.  It's helped a lot.",8,58
Adderall,"This has helped me a lot, but I have a couple tips. There are different brands that people will react differently to (I thought they would all act the same but no). I had a bad reaction with the first generic brand I tried, tried a different generic brand, and had a better experience. So look into that because not everyone believes that there's such a difference between different brands but to me there was. Second, I'm overweight and thought decreased appetite? good! but I would advise to still make sure you're eating frequently enough. Food has such an impact on brain functioning so not eating for 6 hours because you didn't feel like it is a bad habit to start! Once I got those slight issues settled, this drug really helped.Just be smart",9,44

Adderall,"Having ADD has been a bumpy ride for me, especially when it comes to finding the correct medication. As a Mechanical Engineering major, my work load is very heavy and being able to focus is essential and Adderall Xr certainly gives me the ability to do so. I've been taking 30mg xr for about 2-3 years. Prior to adderall I took Vyvanse and Concerts which did not work as well for me as adderall. It also took me a while to work adderall into my schedule as efficient as possible as I don't like taking it EVERYday. But I've got to say I found a happy medium that allows for the least amount of side effects and it is working absolute wonders for me.",9,36
Adderall,"Please be aware of  all side effects before taking this drug. Adderal is highly addictive and it is very likely that 1 taking this drug will continue to do so for a long period of time out of necessity. Its best to slowly decrease the intake of the drug so the withdrawal symptoms are not 2 intense. Taking more than prescribed can lead 2 severe &amp; even life threatening situations. Hallucinations, hearing voices, severe insomnia, &amp; personality changes are inevitable if abused. With that being said, this is a highly effective yet short term solution bc of the dependency factor.  At times the side effects may be so severe that the person taking the drug doesn't even notice bc they are so happy and focused on everything else.Notice Excessive Movement?",2,29
Adderall,"While Adderall definitely helped my ADD symptoms, the comedown was absolutely horrible. I was on 30mg per day (20mg IR in morning, 10mg IR 5hrs later). It made me finally able to focus, and stay organized for the 5 months I took it. However, as soon as it started wearing off, I turned into a real big jerk, and I even lost some friends because of it. I eventually discontinued it after having a mental breakdown, and due to several of my closest friends and family approaching me about how I was acting. I ended up switching to Concerta and currently take 36mg per day. I find that it works 10 times better than Adderall did for me. Long story short, Adderall, while definitely very effective at treating my symptoms, wasn't the right fit for me.",3,29
Adderall,"I began talking Adderall about 3 months ago, I was scared to say the least. Many people I talked to advised against taken the ADD meds, instead suggesting naturopathic (?) meds. I wouldn't know where to start! I have suffered from depression since I can remember, started taking meds for that in my early 20s. Looking back at my life as a child into my teens and adult years, there was no doubt in my mind that I also had ADHD. Now 20 years later, I realized it was time to do something about it. Dr started me off at 5mg, then 10mg, up to 20mg now. It's amazing how this stuff works, I can ACTUALLY concentrate AND complete something!! The only complaint I have is that I am a little (more) spacey, could be because I'm a mother of 3 though!!!",9,36
Adderall,"Do not take Adderall if high blood pressure runs in your family. Be especially careful not to take it if you have high blood pressure already. I had normal blood pressure until I started taking Adderall. Ever since, my blood pressure has been at least 130/80, and I have measured it at 162/88 while on the drug. I am a 20 year old male, and my dad has hypertension, which is where this incredible susceptibility comes from. I stopped taking it but I still have high readings, which only started when I began taking Adderall. Do yourself a big favor and harangue your doctors about Adderall if you or your family has a history of high blood pressure. You don't want to end up on BP meds.",1,22
Adderall,"I have Primarily Inattentive ADHD and recently was diagnosed at 39 years old. I was on Amphetamine salts IR 10 mg 2x's a day as needed at 1st, which worked ok, but gave me some side effects I didn't appreciate, such as peeing so much it kept me awake at night. Also it worked inconsistently per day and sometimes per hour. It gave me blurred vision. So I was switched to 20 mg amphetamine salts xr which is much easier on my system. I don't have the urinary issues and it works a bit more consistently, though I don't get the zeroed in focus that I got with the IR and I still get some blurred vision, but no issues that cause it. Also, with both I have mildly decreased appetite, which is fine since I'm overweight and also a very dry mouth.",8,20
Adderall,"I was diagnosed with ADHD in 06 and I found out in order to have ADHD as an adult you had to have it as a child so I look back on my childhood in Real Life 4 did have ADHD as kid but never got treatment for it because my mom didn't believe any mental illness so I didn't start treatment with the ADHD until 2006 I was placed on Ritalin but I found it to be ineffective and then I stopped treatment and I started treatment up again a few months ago and I was giving our all and I found it to be very effective working but with 2 major side effect keeps me awake and constipation , but outside of those two it works wonderfully.",10,10
Adderall,"I take 5 milligrams as needed for school. I take it right before school, maybe around 6am, school starts around 7am. I've noticed extremely dizziness, I get hot so easily, even more anxious, so much more depressed, so tired, terrible headaches, and excessive talking. I wake up in the morning to bump into every possible wall, my vision is completely blacked out. I can't walk for more than a mile, without feeling faint. I eat well and drink lots of water (due to a horrible experience with Vyvanse, in which i lost 20lbs) Not only that but falling asleep is killer. I've never taken such a small dose, and have such poor results.",5,19
Adderall,I have had ADHD for as long as I can remember. My first real memory is when I was an altar boy. I would go to the church but could never concentrate on what I was supposed to be doing. I would forget pretty much everything and was just sort of walking through things as a zombie. Every time I had to serve a mass I had to rework everything in my brain. This went on for years through school where I couldn't pay attention and I would actually ask the same question two or three times. I did not find Adderall until later in life because when I was young it was not available. After taking 15 milligrams of the instant release twice a day my life changed for the better. I was able to concentrate for the first time. Not covrd by ins as am +20,10,35
Adderall,"I was recently put on Adderall for ADD. I have suffered ever since I can remember with not being able to focus on anything, having a wandering mind, and doing very poorly in school. I began to just think school wasn't for me. I had heard many negatives on Adderall and that is why I never asked my doctor if it would be an option for me. He suggested I give it a try and now I am on 10 mg every day/as needed and I feel better than I have in years. It has helped my depression/anxiety as well. I am happy to learn now and attend school. Wonderful drug for me.",10,42
Adderall,"I take the XR, and it allows me to focus throughout the day at work and in classes. I can actually sit down and complete a task, I can get something done (for once), and the only side effects I really experienced were a bit of dry mouth at first and some continued loss of appetite. Otherwise, completely effective. Unfortunately, my insurance company only covers the brand name. Otherwise, it would be much, much cheaper. It's the brunt of my monthly prescription costs.",10,17
Adderall,Was the only drug that was effective,10,10
Adderall,"Side effects: Dry mouth, anxiety (if used when tired), euphoria, hyperfocus (when dose too high) Adderall allows me to concentrate and study for a reasonable amount of time while also offering flexibility on when I use it; both XR and short-release are quick in-and-out drugs, unlike SSRIs. My performance improved dramatically with use of Adderall, but there were definitely a few cons. Hyperfocus is a huge problem that alluded me for a few months. Because Adderall affects the brain, it distorts the user's reality. I felt that I was getting a lot done, and it wasn't until my colleagues at work told me that I was garbage at multitasking that I realized my dose was too high. Beware of this. Focus =/= productivity",8,34
Adderall,My feet in the bottom upfront hurt all the time sometimes they go to sleep,8,9
Adderall,"Very effective, but very addictive. You may not realize until you stop taking it.  What do you do?  It helps the condition...but you become dependent on the drug?",9,21
Adderall,Calms mind for focus.,9,10
Adderall,"My life has totally changed for the better since starting this medication about a year ago. I am 36 so when I was growing ADHD didn't exist, but I was that kid that couldn't sit still or concentrate and talked 24/7! This medication has given me my quality of life back, it lifted the fog that has always been in my brain and I can't be more thrilled to have found this Med! Thank you Adderall for giving me my life back!!!",10,53
Adderall,my doctor gave me adderall because i cant sit still long enough to concentrate and study and do productive things at work. He gave me 10mg to take twice a day but i didn't feel any effects from the drug. I decided to take 2 10mg at the same time and still nothing. I am so sad right now because all i want to do is concentrate and study and do my job with concentration. I was really excited to take these pill but now am dissapointed. I think I am one of those people who are resistant to stimulant medication,1,19
Adderall,"My experience with adderall, for one it makes me poop like crazy, I'm super thirsty (dry mouth) and it KILLS my appetite. I don't eat for hours and I didn't have a desire to. But while I was at work I was on top of everything, as far proofreading, catching errors, it does make you focus and more alert. I was multi tasking and the fact that i didn't feel overwhelmed, was a plus.",10,40
Adderall,"I started taking adderall in 2012 to 2015 with a 15 month break in 2014 due pregnancy and breastfeeding. I was diagnosed with ADD as a child but held off on taking medication until I was 26. Adderall immediately helped with focus and even energy and motivation. I excelled at work and finally was able to complete tasks instead of starting them and trailing off to something else. In 2015 when I discontinued adderall, I was taking a pretty high prescribed dose of 30mg twice a day. I started noticing the cons of the come downs were outweighing the pros of when the medication was working. I had anxiety, irritability and extreme fatigue. They switched me to dex which was much smoother but has increased my BP. I try Vyvanse tomorrow.",6,37
Adderall,Before adderall i was on edge i had put everything off and neglected myself and my relationship. Now i have that drive to want to do what i love eapecially art.  Im a graphic atrist and have that drive again. Anyone that is irritable with every little thing feel lazy cause u dont want to leave your house and have no social life please see a doctor to test u for adhd add it will I promise change and possibly save ur social life and self esteem,10,53
Adderall,I was first diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 6. My parents at the time decided against treating my illness with any form of medication. This was in the mid-90s during a time where ADHD and ADHD medications were very controversial. This led to self-medicating with prescription opioids throughout my teens and early twenties. It wasn't until several psychiatrists continued to stress the importance of treating my ADHD that I finally decided to try the Adderall. And I can proudly say that it changed my life and saved me from a serious drug addiction. I'm now in my third year of school studying psychopharmacology. Thank you Adderall.,8,76
Adderall,"What a genuis medication! It changed my life completely. I strongly believe and from my experiences using for over a year that addetall is extremely helpful for those who really suffer from ADHD. I'm much more focused, happy, a lot get accomplished each day, my emotions are in place. It helps me keep the weight down. There are some side effects, my main concern is trouble sleeping but that can be controlled with meditation and other methods. I wish I've gotten diagnosed earlier, my life would have been much more different. But it's never too late. Great full for this medicine.",0,60
Adderall,"Added 40 mg/day to Wellbutrin. I don't space out anymore, and actually do things start to finish.  My doctor said Wellbutrin may decrease the effect of stims, and lengthen effective time.  I don't experience any crashes with this combo, but have noticed that some effects from the Wellbutrin are a little less.  This combo is for me for now, but expect will need to change as tolerance grows. Needed 20mg in the AM to begin therapeutic effects.  Definitely could go to bed while on this, don't seem to experience any of the common side effects, or any speediness. Actually increased my appetite (Wellbutrin suppressed)",7,16
Adderall,"I was on Adderall XR 20 mg for about 6 months, and then developed hives.  Could've been the bottle, could've been a delayed reaction (sulfa allergies).  I don't know, but it was perfect until then. Decreased appetite, yes, but that's not negative as far as I'm concerned.  Doc switched me to Vyvanse XR, and I can tell you that while you will focus, it's not as focused as when on Adderall (at least for me).  Decreased appetite but nothing like with Adderall.  I've also been on Evekeo (10 mg) tablet.  I've only tried that once, and while it will definitely stimulate you (closer to Adderall), I find there's really not hyper focus.  Just a lot of movement and staying awake.  If you haven't tried it yet, I would go with Adderall XR first.",10,30
Adderall,"ADD is NOT a made up condition. I'm 26.  Without Adderall/Vyvanse, i have no mental energy or focus to do anything. And it has been this way my entire life. School has gone from being an F and D student to being an A and B student. It has nothing to do with being lazy and everything to do with having a real chemical imbalance in the brain. Anyways, have been full time for 2 years until 7 weeks ago I convinced myself it wasn't working anymore and I didn't need it. Big mistake! I am ready to start up again next week. I can feel the old me come back, the me I hated. If you truly have ADD/ADHD, this will change your life for the better.  Some negatives are sleeping less, decreased apatite, and often weak erections on it (despite high libido)",9,69
Adderall,"I started taking this when I was 17. I was struggling in school, barely passing my main subjects.  Within 10 days of taking Adderall, I could tell it started to work.  I could concentrate on listening to my teachers.  My brain slowed down enough where I could do my homework.  It all started to make sense. My self-esteem improved with my grades improving to 85's and above within 6 months.  Side effects have been loss of appetite, not needing to sleep as much. Unfortunately, I've had bright red blood in my stool this past month.  It also happened about 6 months ago.  I will be discussing with my doctor.",9,37
Adderall,"I am currently 18 years old, and I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression when I was 13 years old, and I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 14. I currently use Vyvanse for my ADHD, and it has improved my life so much. I went from always zoning out and failing classes, to becoming a straight A student again, and I have been able to connect with my family so much more. I also use Prozac for my anxiety, and there does not seem to be any issues with my anxiety flaring up, however there is a noticeable difference when I only use Prozac and not Vyvanse. I also have lost some appetite for eating but I still eat enough to satisfy my body. Sleeping isn't a huge issue, as I usually take it around 6:00am each morning.",9,36
Adderall,"Didn't really do much to help, after around 7 months, it dosn't do anything",3,18
Adderall,"I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until my 30s.  I am now 47.  My biggest struggle is trying to stay awake, focused and on task.  On Adderall I was finally able to organize all the billions of thoughts racing around in my head and focus in on the tasks at hand.  Downside - as the years went on I went from 5 mg 2x a day to 20 mg 2x a day over a period of 10 or so years.  I ended up getting off because I started feeling very hot all the time - shorts in 40 degree weather was comfortable for me. The other problem was I was starting to sleep 12 hours a day (work from home so literally worked, slept, ate, slept)- this resolved after stopping the Adderall. Loved how kept me efficient in tasking but extreme fatigue forced me to find another alternative",7,50
Adderall,"I knew I struggled with ADD in college but refused to go on medication because of the stigma associated with Adderall. My father has ADD as well and refused medications. Now at 56 he is homeless, can't hold down a job, can't control his finances, health, or any responsibilities. When I graduated college and started my full-time job I realized that I was heading towards the same path as my pops. I love my job and am very passionate about it, but following instructions or staying on task during an 8 hour work day was IMPOSSIBLE. 5mg of XR/day (2x on my v. busy days) saved my job and life! I feel like I finally have a clutch to support me with my disability now. It has improved every aspect of my life: social, financial, academic, etc.",10,74
Adderall,"Hi everyone. I am 25 years old married with a 6 month old son. I was diagnosed with severe ADHD at the age of about 10...I'm talking horrible behavior, bad grades, constant moving, etc. my mother told the doctors no medicine at that age. Then around 12 my mother caved in and gave me the adderall, I hated bc of the instant side effects for me.  I continued to take it until about 14 and I made a 100% improvement.  At 14 I learned to cope with the ADHD on my own. But now 11 years later in the real world with many stresses, my ADHD had gotten worse then ever, to the point that my wife wanted to leave me because she couldn't handle it.  I got my prescription back and my life is amazing.. 30mg IR 3x a day 1 in a.m 1 after lunch 1 on way home from work.",10,74
Adderall,"I'm a 31yr old female, 5'4, 115lbs. I was 1st prescribed adderall in 2012, so I've taken it about 3 1/2 yrs. within that time there's ben a few situations that forced me 2 go with out meds for a week or more, which reminded me how much it helps! Without it I could sleep 18hrs for days &amp; still be wanting 2 sleep an hr or so after getting up! I can sleep while taking it, but don't have the strong compulsion to. The first day taking it I've learned 2 only take half bc if not it feels like I'm on cocaine, even after just a week of not having it. But the 2nd day &amp; thereafter is fine.I  never experiencd any comedown like some ppl. The only negative is without it I get agitated easily &amp; get on my own nerves when it comes 2 lack of concentration, forgetfulness,n sleeping 2 much.",9,47
Adderall,"I have had ADHD all my life, very smart and talented but almost never motivated. I was an A student and could easily go down to F because lost interest quickly. Was emotional and failed at marriage and relationships. Adderall makes me accomplish so much in a day, I want to do everything. I'm not emotional, I focus, in a great mood. Be very careful with dosage, can be very harmful and addictive. Eat regularly, even when not hungry. I still don't sleep well on it, I have to try not taking it in late afternoon.",0,57
Adderall,"This drug was prescribed to after ritilin didn't work well. This medication helped my ADHD but the side affects were unbearable. Cotton mouth, irritability, anxiety, panic attacks. I seemed like the cons outweighed the pros. Much more successful than ritilin but not enough. My doctor decided to try Vyvanse, a new version of adderall with less side effects and better outcomes for treatment plus no crash after dinner",7,32
Adderall,My face breaks out in itchy blotchy spots and I never sleep,7,12
Adderall,"Adderall has improved my life drastically! So drastically that I had to come on here and write about it. Since I have ADHD, simple tasks can be very hard for me. I'm 19 and just started working at a store and before being on it I was having trouble following directions and a manager even told me I needed extra training. Anyway, I managed to do well enough to not be asked to leave. Now that I'm on it I think my managers are sort of shocked at how productive I am. So much that the store manager even came up to me and said the other managers have told her that I've improved so much and become a very hard worker. On my last 2 anatomy exams I got a B. I'm able to focus and do things without giving up so easily.",10,49
Adderall,"I was once a procrastinating, underemployed, muscular 18 year old who was unsure of his future. My ADHD made it impossible to focus, my motivation was terrible, and I snapped on anyone over the smallest thing. I knew about Ritalin...also knew its excess side effects. Heard about Adderall and decided maybe I should speak with my PCF. He prescribed me Adderal, a pill that can either make or break you. If you have had ANY history of drug abuse AVOID IT. It took me a month to realize I was abusing it. I lost sleep, weight, gained a tolerance. When I decided I'd better let my wife handle my medication, she gave me my  two IRs per day and still does. It helped alot. The medication is wonderful for ADHD but can very easily kill you if you abuse it",8,64
Adderall,"I've been taking Adderall for roughly two years now,I could honestly say it helped me  SO much.Having A.D.D my whole life, it completely made my life out of control.I only realized how much of my issues were connected to having A.D.D until l i took my medication,i cannot even explain.Its insane sometimes it even got me emotional thinking about it cause i would say to everyone around me is this how people without ADD feel ? and think wow i missed out on SO much.Luckily i could say everything has changed. Graduated highschool,found myself a job,totally different group of friends,even the way i interact and feel about myself TOTAL CHANGE. I would have gave it a 10/10 but my loss of appetite and could not sleep.sucks but pros over cons",8,63
Adderall,I've been diagnosed with ADHD for many years my child hood was filled with lots of trouble. I've had more failing grades than I can count more referrals then most kids been kicked out of an amazing school and lost a full ride scholarship.  I'm not blaming all these problems on being ADHD but not having self control for my actions is a big factor my doctor finally prescribed me to Adderall and the difference is cazy. I have been able to stay focused on school and all my classes for the first time in 6 years I am getting honor roll I have an interest in being in school. I'd recommend any one to give Adderall a  try. It truly has made my life a lot easier by being able to stay focused.,10,57
Adderall,Adderall IR had the same duration of action as Adderall XR for me. Both of them only had lasting effects for four hours and then quit.,5,24
Adderall,"I was a failing student, failing math 2 times. In my junior year of high school I took Adderall for the first time, on the first day of the school year. The first day of taking it was astonishing. I was very concentrated in math class, and that's not it, I had a desire to learn once I got into class. My grades improved to the high 90 percentiles, which I never thought I'd accomplish. But there are side effects to taking Adderall. For me it's dizziness for about an hour in, headaches on occasion, and being very sleepy around afternoon. I urge parents who have kids with ADD/ADHD to let your kids try it out for a month. It might save their futures. You can skip doses as much as you like, so I don't take it on summer break or weekends.",8,43
Adderall,"I've tried straterra, Dexedrine, Ritalin, vyvanse.  I would take vyvanse but it's way too $$.  Generic adderall has been the best as far as cost and effects.  The only thing I have disliked is the connotation adderall has because I can tell some doctors are against it. I have had two doctors lecture me on how something else must be wrong because I take 75 mg daily.  I tried to switch to the XR and lower my dose to 60mg, but insurance won't cover it.  This medication has been really helpful for me, but I feel like I need it because without it I'm a wild ape (hyper, make silly noises, annoying). It keeps me calm and focused on the big picture.  I would use modafilin if I could because the side effects are less pronounced, but again the price.",8,39
Adderall,"So I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and am taking welbutrin however it wasn't doing enough so I requested to try a stimulant, specifically this one since the ratings are so high and predominately positive. Within minutes of taking 10mg the anxiety was... just wayy too much. I also didn't really know how to feel or what to do. It did help me with focusing...better than almost anything else I've tried. Then after that I went away about a half an hour later I started to feel better after I ate something. The remainder of the day I was so tired I just layed in bed. It works don't get me wrong but I just cant put my faith in an addictive/phisically dependant med. I stopped taking it. Gonna try strattera next",8,18
Adderall,"Could not focus at all before adderall. Took for 21 days aka 3 weeks and could finish task at hand, after 21 days focus doubled and I have taken on more tasks and can finish with time to spare and @ 100% no errors. It works.",10,45
Adderall,"@Nishimaru2. I have the same problem your son does except mine is a bit...odd. If I'm not watching what I'm doing I'll find myself in the bathroom plucking facial hairs with tweezers. Weird, I know but only on Adderall.",5,37
Adderall,I was diagnosed with A.D.D and I've been using Adderall for just over 2 years now. My 9th year of school I finished with a very low GPA just over a 1.0 and finished most of my classes with either Fs or Ds but this past year that I was able to get my medicine I was awarded AB Honorle And passing every class with an A except 2 Bs. The mass improvement of my ability to focus and actually want to work actually made the principal think I was cheating since i've had such a bad school record (For grades),10,69
Adderall,"I was diagnosed with ADHD unexpectedly when I started going to a counseling center a couple months ago, after I got in trouble for bringing marijuana to school. I was also diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. I am 15 and this all came as one big unexpected shock to me. I felt useless and pathetic knowing this. I was put on medication for all of the mental disorders, including Adderall. I have always been a good student, but now I am actually able to focus in school and now, I'm excited about going to classes and doing homework. I actually feel like I'm worth something for once.",9,74
Adderall,"Yes, this medication does work wonders, at first.  Diagnosed ADHD (by a Psychiatrist)  at the age of 26.  The first 3 years it worked quite well and felt like a godsend.  I took 5-6 days a week and my life demonstratively improved.  Focus, completing tasks, mental clarity, improved self-esteem...life was good. Adderall, like other CNS stimulants, tend to become less effective after time and I noticed this more pronouncedly by my 5th year.  At that point, I felt trapped by the drug and tried to stop.  The problem was that even after a month or more without Adderall, none of discontinuation symptoms were improving.  While I continue to use Adderall for maintenance, I derive little benefit.  Be aware, the effects won't last indefinitely!",2,65
Adderall,"When I was in grade school I had a real hard time learning. I could not pay attention in class. My mind was always wandering. I was always daydreaming and looking out the windows, I could not retain any information. I was forgetful and bored. My grades were always C's and D's no matter how hard I tried. I was always fidgety, had a hard time sitting still, always twirling my hair or shaking my legs or feet. I hated school, I felt so dumb. As I got into high school I was so far behind I gave up trying. When I started driving I would go through red lights, stop signs etc. I was just daydreaming all the time. I kept losing my car keys, my glasses, forgetting where I put them. I am out of space, but Adderal saved my life! I am 59. No side effects",10,96
Adderall,"I was diagnosed 8 yrs ago with ADD, at 45 I wish I'd had  this info and medication. My life has changed for the better. I do  notice a major difference in the pink 30 mg   verses the orange. The pink ones make me feel like I'm a zombie. They also make me sad and I get red blotches over my body.",7,49
Adderall,"Once getting on adderall I found it gave me just enough euphoria to put down everything from alcohol to opiates, while giving me the drive and ambition to seek an engineering degree. I must warn people adderall is a stimulant, it's out of your body rather quickly (1-2 days) so addiction in the physical withdrawal sense is not much, although years of taking it will keep you relying on it -that's a PROMISE. Depending on the dosage you'll be severely lethargic and wind up sleeping a few days. Beware of the day's end, you'll likely need something to sleep, or relax which can cause problems. Despite the caution, you'll be a morning person and love it, just remember the word moderation and you'll be a new you!",8,83
Adderall,"I was diagnosed with ADHD at eight . I was put on Ritalin then. Awful stuff. That turned me away from  taking anything for years. I started taking adderall xl at the age of twenty-seven. I didn't notice a change until my doc raised my dosage from 20 to 25mg.  My work was better. Heck my life turned around.  I finished projects I started. I payed attention. I remembered little things that use to evade me. Like names, where I put things, and what I was just doing. I also noticed I wasn't as depressed. I could sleep better. Just do not take xl late or sleeping may be difficult. One thing and I can't stress enough. If you have a loved one who is on or going to be on adderall. It is addictive. Watch for the signs of abuse. Monitor teens.",8,46
Adderall,"My son took this medicine for more than a month we don't like the side effect he never stop biting his fingers, excessive nasal discharges he end up with more problems than benefits.",0,35
Adderall,"This medication has changed my life. I was prescribed Adderall due to ADHD and chronic fatigue and it has greatly improved my quality of life in regards to both diagnosis. I am on a very small dose and have room to take more on particularly bad days, but 10mg on a regular, daily basis is the perfect amount for me.",10,54
Adderall,"For me, Adderall is a dream and a nightmare all wrapped in one pill. When I wake up I need the adderall just to be productive in my day, it works like a charm and makes me more creative and motivated. But I find that I need more and more to keep going. Eventually when the day is over and its too late to take any more pills, I feel zoned out and unable to sleep. If adderral came with a powerful sleep medicine,  it would be a perfect drug. Although I don't like the anti-social aspect that comes with it. You get so concentrated that you become socially awkward and don't want to talk with anybody. Also when I drink on adderall I can become crazy aggressive at times. But other than that I love adderall, I've done some of my best work on it.",9,52
Adderall,I do not like taking medicine but had extreme anxiety and trouble paying attention before.  I wish I took this before been a few days and more so much more focused.  I haven't misplaced phone or car keys,10,60
Adderall,"I have been using Adderall for about 2 years now. I am an adult male at the age of 25. I always had an issue focusing in school and I have had a rocking issue my entire life. I tend to rock back and forth while reading or sitting about. It was very difficult to complete homework because I would try to figure out the answers to my homework problems but my rocking would take all of my focus and no matter how hard I tried to stop the rocking, I would always end up doing it anyway. As I attended college I was put on academic probation and decided to see a Doctor. Since I have been diagnosed and prescribed Adderall, my life has changed 100% for the better. No more rocking and my focus is incredible!",10,66
Adderall,Good with increased mental focus and less  distractions by activities that were going on around me. I have nothing negative to say about the Adderall. It has improved my ability to control my  attention and give me greater intensity in thinking and reasoning.,10,80
Adderall,"Adderall has totally brought my life into focus. I started taking it about 6 months ago I'm 39 now and really wish I had this medicine as a kid. In addition to ADD I had severe anxiety and depression as a child/teenager. Adderall has given me focus, lifted my general mood, taken my anxiety away and made me a productive human being. I'm actually starting my own business! The only bad thing is that you really have to be careful of how much you take because it can have the opposite effect i.e. severe anxiety and no focus but if you take it the right way it will change your life! One other bad thing is the stigma surrounding the medicine and being treated like an addict by some pharmacists.",9,126
Adderall,It makes you feel very energetic and makes you want to accomplish everything and it makes you very interested in stuff going on with yourself. It keeps you awake and very alert and you feel like you are on top of the world.,9,93
Adderall,"I knew I was different when I went to school. Being an only child I was very loved and cared for. I lived for the attention in kindergarten I knew I was not like everyone else it took me longer to learn things than others I wouldn't listen fully to instructions. I was so eager to please I fell over myself trying to prove things to be accepted I was outgoing and a class clown my mother always got notes home about me things like she doesn't sit still gets out of her seat talk talk talk I'm grown and my mother has passed away. My best friend therapist has shown me PTSD and ADHD, now I know who I am now.",10,48
Adderall,This pill definitely keeps me focused.,10,63
Adderall,"Took XR but IR is a little heavy for me. Now I split my meds in half 5mg 2-3 times a day. Duration seems better than XR. I take lamictal as well. IR helps me get more done but I don't feel personally that the good outweigh the bad. I have reached a norm. Weight. I eat healthier I look healthier. And I take better care of my body. At first - dry skin slightly, hyper focused (my body did not know how to react) I smelT AWFUL at first! Haha I sweat it out ew! I can't find this side effect anywhere. It can take a toll if you don't take care of your body. Stay healthy.",9,46
Adderall,"I was 23 when I was diagnosed with ADHD. Started Adderall, I take 30 mg of SR a day and the difference is phenomenal! I get up with ease because I know I can tackle all tasks with astounding motivation and actually enjoy doing tedious work. I am co-morbid with anxiety, rumination, and I was highly neurotic. I found myself aggressive, quick tempered, and easily abusing marijuana and alcohol. This all changed with Adderall, I am rational, reflect on situations in a positive light, and generally just a more helpful and kind person. Adderall completely saved my professional and personal life. Side note, it can cause erectile dysfunction but it will go away after your body is used to the cycle.",10,120
Adderall,It works but I think it might be the effect from having extra energy so you do more things.  It definitely helps with motivation and depression.  Ironically it got rid of my anxiety as well.,7,92
Adderall,"I have been taking Adderall for two years and it has probably saved my life. I had been misdiagnosed as bi-polar with no co-morbid ADHD, and was prescribed benzodiazepines and anti-depressants. I eventually became suicidal when Abilify was added,and was lucky enough to have a moment of clarity and changed doctors and hospital affiliates. The week I was started on ADHD meds, I started to become the person I should be. I only wish I could have been diagnosed as a child, I feel I missed half my education. I can now focus all day, keep a train of thought long enough to finish mundane to complex tasks, and have written and recorded an album of music that had been completed but in disarray. No side effects, no weight loss or changes in eating habits.",10,120
Adderall,"This medicine has improved my life significantly allowing me to have significantly improved ability to concentrate on task at hand vs never completing a task but jumping from one to another. Unsure sadly though, may no longer be able to afford it. Insurance changed to only high deductible HSA. No other options.",0,45
Adderall,Adderall has been a blessing to me. I take 30mg twice a day and my thinking has become so much more clear. I am now able to pay attention and absorb what is going on around me. I have had no negative side effects except for an occasional night where it might take me an extra 30 minutes to fall asleep. I still have a healthy appetite since taking Adderall. This medicine has made my life so much better.,9,72
Adderall,"I have ran the gauntlet of ADD meds, starting with Concerta then tried Vyvance which worked well in the beginning,  then my Dr switched to Adderall XR,  then to I R, which works best for me I take 20mg twice a day definitely helps with non stop thinking,  racing thoughts,  and just simply getting motivated.  I have been on the IR for about a year and the highs are finally outweighing the lows. 39 years old and can see light at the end of the tunnel.",9,87
Adderall,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 6 yrs old and pretty much just learned to deal with it until age 14. When I started 8th grade, my parents put me on the meds and I absolutely love it! I'm so much more successful! Plus I feel better about myself as a person. I don't know how I went all those years without it. Its definitely made my life better.",10,63
Adderall,Should have started with Adderall at first. My eight year old son is doing good.,9,32
Adderall,"When I was diagnosed with ADHD in the 3rd grade they put me on Adderall and then I became a person I was not. I had social anxiety but got exceptionally good grades in school where others failed. Adderall changes your personality and was the worst 12 years of my life, I had no friends because engaging in conversation was nearly impossible. It traps your thoughts in a prison of your mind and suppresses any creativity.",1,69
Adderall,It's great grades came up from straight F's to B &amp; C's.,10,41
Adderall,"I always knew I was different from everyone else. I was very quiet and shy. But in my mind I couldn't shut up. My mind was loud. In class I could never stop fidgeting, playing with my hair, scratching an itch, doodling on notebooks. I wondered why nobody else squirmed around like me. At 24 I was diagnosed with ADD. Adderall is life changing. I'm finally normal. I feel like everyone else. My mind is at ease. I am in charge of my thoughts. I can have genuine conversations with people without my mind wondering. I am finally happy after years of struggles. I am organized and more peaceful.",10,189
Adderall,Very effective in treating ADHD.,10,31
Adderall,"I have been taking it for several years.  There was a time about a year ago when all the Pharmacies could not get any and I went about a month without.  Being a Service Advisor, I deal with a lot of numbers (Vin, License Plates, etc.). After a few days without, I started reversing a lot of the numbers.  I would see the correct order but would say out loud or write down a reversed version. I had to go slower and double check what I had written.  A positive side effect is it gets me off the couch on the day(s) I have off and motivates me to get stuff done around the house that needs to be done. It kept me up at night at first, but after awhile, I learned not to take it too late in the day. I would recommend it to anyone who has ADHD.",10,105
Adderall,It was like a light bulb went on in my brain.,10,96
Adderall,"Lost about 60 pounds, was a bit concerned, and I had to force myself to eat sometimes.",8,53
Adderall,"I've taken Adderall for 2 years. The first 6 months, worked very well. Balanced me out, kept me focused &amp; side effects were minimal. But, the efficiency of Adderall has really gone down in my experience. I often find myself hyper focusing on things I don't need to &amp; the side effects have gotten much worse. Insomnia, horrible dry mouth (= more cavities), I get antsy &amp; shaky at times &amp; I also feel I've become dependent on it. Next doctors appointment, I will be asking to switch out to something else. Its a good medicine at first, but understand that many of the great reviews are likely written by newer Adderall users.",6,91
Adderall,Keeps you focused. However when it wears off I can't sleep till 6 hours later.,9,30
Adderall,I liked how focused it made me however if I was agitated it made it worse,6,35
Adderall,"Hyper focused, dry mouth. Both this and Straterra put me into state of manic. Used Depakote 750mg for mental balance.",4,15
Adderall,I've taken Vyvanse extended release and Adderall extended release. I didn't like the mood swings and irritability I suffered when they would wear off.  My doctor has since put me on Adderall immediate release 30 milligram tablets twice a day. I've taken these tablets for 2 years now and love that I can focus and I am not having mood swings or irritable at all. I have experienced dry mouth and some jitters as well as trouble sleeping. I take Ambien to sleep and it is no longer an issue. I have to take a vitamin supplement due to a huge weight loss though. I was over weight when I started Adderall and now am at a healthy weight and maintaining that weight without issue.,10,88
Adderall,"After 37 years of knowing something wasn't right with my brain, I was diagnosed with ADHD, Inattentive Type in grad school and was prescribed Adderall. Where do I start??? This medication literally changed my life. Imagine being a gifted kid who eventually could barely pass middle school math - that's me. After a lifetime of compensating for my slow processing, hiding my disorganization, and pretending to be on the same page with everyone else, this explains everything. Adderall has made a NIGHT AND DAY difference in my motivation level, what I understand and follow, and even my mood/emotional reactivity. In a word, amazing. If I ever meet the people who discovered Adderall, I'm kissing them - my husband agrees.",10,194
Adderall,Finally I was diagnosed with ADD as an adult after struggling my whole life with ADD.  I was put on Adderall and my life changed 100% for the better.  I think this is a wonderful medication for those with ADD!,10,82
Adderall,"I'm a 57 year old male that has been clean and in recovery for ten years now. I have abstained from anything stronger than aspirin the whole time. Chronic pain had made it necessary to begin a closely monitored treatment schedule, but I was still losing a lot of focus on tasks at work and any motivation for anything but sleeping at home. After talking to the doctor we added 20mg Adderal 3 times a day. The difference has been amazing. I normally work pretty long hours and had been having trouble staying awake in the morning going to work and evenings going home. No more. Properly scheduling the doses keeps me  active and focused my entire day. Didn't take long to find out that it increased energy and desire in other areas also. All others.",10,82
Adderall,"I am prescribed Adderall XRs. I am only on 30 mg once a day and my Dr won't increase it. The medication definitely makes me motivated, have energy, and feel a nice since of well-being. I am concerned with a few side effects I get almost every time. I get numb on the left side of my neck and in my shoulder. I also get really cold feet and my toes look purple with very slow capillary refill. I also already had a sleep problem before all this, so my nights are always pretty restless.",7,25
Adderall,Great medication. I was doing tasks again and talking to people again. The only down side is I want something more 24hrs. The instant release tabs had peaks and after the peaks I would have massive anxiety and the same was with the extended release. It's a great medicine but not for me.,9,26
Adderall,This is a great medicine for focus but it has a downside to it as well. It can cause chest pains. So you must be careful with usage.,9,24
Adderall,"Adderall in my opinion is a Miracle! I am prescribed the (IR) 30mg strength, three times a day. Adderall I feel has significantly improved my quality of life.",9,50
Adderall,"I am almost 50 yr old female just, diagnosed with ADD/ADHD. In elementary school super bright but would finish my work quickly and disrupt the rest of the class.  I was never considered hyper just a little naughty and disrupted.  Now looking back as things in my life have become more disruptive as I age.  Couldn't hold a job lately, drink too much etc.  I have the Adderral now and that's great. However, when I read about it not working or it becomes less effective, I get nervous because I don't want to be that disruptive unemployable person.  I met a Doctor who has ADD as well.  He found that simple blood hormone test and restoring your levels can assist in using less medication, making the medication more effective and less side effects.",10,61
Adderall,Caused migraines.,1,28
Adderall,I've had a wonderful experience with Adderall! It helps me focus and get up to do the daily things that need to be done plus more!,10,38
Adderall,"I like Adderall for my ADHD a lot.  It keeps me focused and I am able to concentrate and accomplish the things that I need to get accomplished, also it helps me with my depression a lot because it makes me feel more happy and motivated.",10,76
Adderall,I too have gone through my whole life with undiagnosed ADHD and I have to say that I have lost so many years of my life both academically and personal. I've been recently diagnosed with ADHD and started Ritalin. I could not tolerate Ritalin. It made me feel like a zombie along with bad headaches. My MD switched me to Adderall and It has changed my life. I wish I would have sought help years ago but I was too embarrassed to seek mental health help. I've been on 30 mg per day of Adderall for 1.5 months now and its worked great except that I think this dose is too low as I have to split the 30 mg into two doses per day. 20 mg works great for me but the other 10 mg I have to take doesn't do much for me.,10,38
Adderall,"Adderall is effective, but it comes with consequences. Both to your physical and mental health. I am 27 years old, I have taken Adderall on and off for about 10 years. Started it my freshman year of college. It was AMAZING at first! Lost that freshman 15, got straight A's, actually ENJOYED my work. Then I started noticing the crash symptoms. Tired, withdrawn, emotionless, sleepless. I stopped taking it because I hated the way it made me feel, but I realized how much more productive I am when taking it. When I start taking it again my immune system is shot, I'm constantly sick with something, I get super irritable. When I don't take it I can barely get out of bed and I always gain weight, which always sucks. It's a vicious cycle.",6,129
Adderall,"I've gone through most of my adult life not knowing that I have ADHD. After finding that I had literally every single symptom. As my doctor said, Whoa!  You're off the chart here! I've been taking 20mg for a month now. Some of my symptoms bother me. Forgetting what I was talking about mid sentence, going into a room forgetting what I was there for. All in all though, I call this medicine a miracle. I hate thinking about how much of my life I've missed out on before this. I was in school to be a Pharmacy Tech. I dropped out within a month, because I just couldn't keep up, or focus. I feel good now. My insurance at first weren't filling it. My doctor had to call the insurance co, they approved it for a year. My doctors appointment to check how this medicine dosage is working. I think I need to go up a bit. I don't have annoying side effects",10,54
Adderall,"I floated through high school, got honors and graduated a year early.  Did the same through a state college, even though I was accepted to Ivy leagues with scholarships.  I chose the easy route as I hated books, and never read anything, despite being able to pass with a bachelors in college and honors in HS just on auditory lecture learning, I was scared to challenge myself.  Went to nursing school 10 years ago and failed out. Then I tried again on Adderall - Out of a class of 140, I'm #1. Everything I read I absorb. I can NOW focus.  Everything's wired tight and each day I am limitless on what I can learn. I feel music. I'm in touch with everything. I thank everyday I'm on it.",10,104
Adderall,"It makes me not able to sleep, irritable, and when I take I just don't feel like me.",2,48
Adderall,"Adderall really helps me focus and stay on task. I used to start projects before I took Adderall and I always got side tracked and not be able to finish what I've started. Now that I take Adderall I complete tasks and I'm able to stay focused throughout the whole project. Also I complete what I've started! Thank you Adderall, you really helped me out!",10,57
Adderall,Great medicine for motivation and getting your life in order. Thoughts are clearer now and I am wondering what my life would have been like if I started the therapy sooner. Have been taking 70mg daily for approx. 7 months. One drawback I have experienced is occasional impulsive behavior linked I believe to over confidence.,10,44
Adderall,Adderall makes me always want to smoke cigarettes to relax and not shake so much. I have a love hate for it I love it but I hate that I have to depend on it everyday to do my daily tasks.,10,42
Adderall,"Adderall has made me successful at work.  It allows me to dominate. I am the hardest worker. I only want to work and get ahead, but not socialize.",9,51
Adderall,"I actually have ADD. This may work for many people, but it gave me bad chest pain.",2,31
Adderall,"I am a 45 year old male and was never diagnosed with ADD or ADHD.  However, I have nearly every symptom and have suffered the consequences of this problem my entire life.  In short, Adderall changed my life.  I have never liked taking any medication but the increase in the quality of my life is worth any side effect I may incur down the road.",10,66
Adderall,"Helps me keep my attention in class,  but seems to make me keep grinding my teeth and move my jaw around.  A tick I guess.",6,35
Adderall,"I've been taking 60mg of Adderall a day for 14 years now. It's a miracle! I don't think I would have made it through high school or college without it. I started when I was 14 and starting high school. I loathed getting up early, but shortly after taking my pills I was awake and motivated to get ready and go about my day. It made boring classes seem more interesting. It gives you this focus and drive to be productive.I don't feel like myself without them. I'm cranky, unmotivated, eat and sleep a lot if I don't take it. Just be cautious with dosage. You do develop a tolerance to it over time. If your blood pressure goes way up and you feel jittery or shaky, your taking too high of a mg. People should start with 10 or 20mg at first.",10,99
Adderall,"36 year old female diagnosed with ADHD. Started on Concerta 30mg daily (2 weeks), no therapeutic effect but had extreme dry mouth, a crash/grogginess in the evenings. Switched to Adderall XR 20mg daily, no therapeutic effect; experienced dry mouth and slight loss of appetite during day, made up for it in evening. Just started 40mg daily and I feel the therapeutic effect. Profound concentration at work, desire to tweak processes, love getting things done, a non-stop interest in being productive with everything. I have this sense of crystal clear clarity of my surroundings, like HDTV sight. Around 5pm, I still feel a crash and extreme tiredness. I will see if I can take a short acting pill to get me through the evening. VERY PLEASED NOW.",8,56
Adderall,It didn't work for my son and he ended up bouncing around on a lot of medicines.,5,16
Adderall,"I'm a full-time college student in my mid-20s. I've been on Adderall for 3 months now. I cut my 15mg IR in half and take it in the morning and the other half 3 hours later (and another half after 3-4 hours if needed). I don't take it everyday, I probably only take it 4x a week. If you don't have an addictive personality, you won't be addicted to it. I have to say it works really well with my ADD. I'm able to study for hours at a time. I don't necessarily think it makes you smarter. It just lets you focus on a task without getting distracted. I think my only complaint is sudden mood swings and agitation. I definitely noticed a difference in my personality the days I'm not on it. I get angry very easily and irritable.",7,39
Adderall,"I have been on Adderall for a little under a month. Let me say, this is the magic pill. I can focus, sit and watch an actual movie, and pay attention in daily life as well as my college. Love Adderall.",9,23
Adderall,I have ADHD &amp; narcolepsy. I recently started Adderall after trying a few other medications. So far the Adderall has been a God send. I hope it continues to help me with my problems.,10,17
Adderall,I've been taking Adderall for now 4 months. It's helped so much! My grades have improved tremendously! I'm more focused and can pay attention a lot more. The only issue is when I take it I take one 30mg pill a day by the end of school I'm exhausted and feel sick. I've lost almost 20 pounds and I don't take in on the weekends because I can't have fun.,0,24
Adderall,"This medication has completely changed my life. Without it I feel like I am not complete. Twisted I feel like I can accomplish anything. Without it I sleep and have no motivation, suffer from depression, anxiety, no social skills. With it my whole social outlook changed, I am no longer shy and not showing away from social encounters. It is definitely a miracle.",10,44
Adderall,"I have used this medication for over three years, with great success in combating lifelong inability to maintain focus, or to complete tasks, get to work on time, etc., etc. Recently, my physician informed me that the manufacturer of Adderall had quit making immediate release tablets (was taking 1-2 20mg/day)- and switched me over to Vyvanse 40mg time released. Now I'm having problems sleeping, feel generally depressed. Doubt they quit making Adderall/as my doctor said...and think it is more likely the authorities was coming down.",9,14
Adderall,"I have been suffering through ADD and Dyslexia my whole life. Together, the two work together to make your life a hell pit. Dyslexia made it harder for me to understand things and ADD made it hard for me to keep my focus long enough to understand it. I have been on and off ADD medications throughout my life, all which had negatives which outweighed the positives. I am now 17, I also lost hope in myself that I would ever be, normal. It was taking me as least 10 times as long to complete task as my classmates. I started to become a burnout... until, I was prescribed Adderall. My head that once felt like a rock, now feels totally capable of thinking. My grades went up and now I have hope. I still have challenges, but they are manageable.",10,42
Adderall,"Started taking Adderall about 3.5 years ago while in my early twenties for ADD. After already been diagnosed at around 7 my parents refused to put me on medicines. I was never able to sit still, go a day without being extremely restless in class, and many times was sent to the office for being loud. After extreme fatigue and no motivation to finish anything including zero motivation to work, depression, etc. I started Adderall. Has helped so much (at first) things got done, class/work was way smoother. And had interest in things I always struggled to absorb. Cons... tolerance builds fast. Sleep is a must or you feel like a corpse. (After the first few weeks sleep comes easier though.) Nervous.  Jittery.",7,19
Adderall,"I have taken Adderall for over 6 yrs now. At first it was the best!  All my problems were solved. Higher concentration, longer attention span, lower appetite, more sociable.  It was awesome. But over the years the side effects have caught up to me.  Increased sweating, higher pulse rate, higher blood pressure, lower quality of sleep, dazed. My shoulder muscles are so tense all the time its almost painful.  I'm prescribed 60mg a day, and that used to be great, but now if I take more than 30 mg my sleep quality suffers to the point where I'm a zombie the next day.  Then I have to take more to feel normal, then I can't sleep again the next night.  But if I don't take it, I'm completely useless for about 4 days.  Therefore, I can't stop taking it.",6,37
Adderall,"I suffer from ADD.  I take 30mg twice a day. It works very well for me, however sometimes I get wicked headaches in my frontal/temple areas which I am sure is a side effect of the Adderall. I am going to see my Doctor in a week and talk this over with him.  I also notice that sometimes I feel really sleepy after I take a dose.",9,15
Adderall,"I would like to say that Adderrall really works, it helps me concentrate, and get things done, My mind doesnt race, and I am able to focus. I do experience the dry mouth, and the loss of appetite.  And I was experiencing a lot of headaches when I first started taking it, and it would be migraines starting from my temple to the pressure in my eye.  I did a self experiment before I completely stopped taking the medicine and began to drink TWO GLASSES of water. 1 before my pill then wait 10 mins and drink another glass of water with the pill.. And through out the day I kept drinking water... And I have no more headaches... Drink water!!!! ALL DAY!",10,59
Adderall,"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD.....I was on regular Adderall....it made me feel great! I was able to focus better and accomplish a lot. I was switched to Adderall XR....it TOTALLY changed my life! After being on it about a month, I started noticing that I was becoming more and more depressed and easily agitated. I also noticed that I had no drive AT ALL! I didn't want to do anything! It got so bad that I became suicidal! I was admitted into the hospital for a brief stay (which was a nightmare!) and learned from the psychiatrist that depression was indeed a side effect of the medicine. I immediately stopped taking it and am slowly getting back to normalcy. Its been about 3 weeks and I feel like I'm almost completely back to normal.",0,31
Adderall,"I've been on Adderall for about 4 years. I was having an extremely hard time focusing, extreme fatigue, general feeling of being lost and overly emotional and unstable. Adderall was an absolute miracle when I started on it. My trouble paying attention, loss of interest in life, constant sleepiness and emotional swings were gone. It made me genuinely happy and self confident for the first time in my life.",6,35
Adderall,"When I began taking Adderall in my early 20's, from dose one I could say I feel normal for the first time in my life since I was a young boy. I was happy and life had meaning and a reason. It allowed me to become productive, and I loved this new feeling of well being in both mind and body. It came after a decade of severe depression, anxiety and panic states, and a multitude of psych issues, and I was like a person on the outside, but inside a disease of agonizing mental anguish and physically I hurt of severe pain but no physical evidence that I was like a 20 year old young man who was only alive because I would not die. A tablet of Adderall changed my life and it is my key to life worth living.",10,32
Adderall,"I am on the IR version and I agree with the person who commented that you forget to eat.  I have lost 12 pounds over the last six months and I have to remember to eat.  As they stated I do get foggy headed and kind of high feeling at times, but when I eat something and remember to take my vitamins since I don't eat as much I am fine.  I am older and I did it so I could study for the CPA exam because I could not keep my mind focused on the study materials.  My work performance has improved phenomenally as well.  My boss noticed at my next review and even commented that I seemed different.  My attention to detail had improved and I was staying focused on my tasks so much better.  Makes me wish I had done something like this long ago.",9,24
Adderall,"I was prescribed Adderall XR 15mg six months ago after trying Focalin XR and not liking it because of severe stomach pains it would give me. Before trying the Adderall and Focalin I was diagnosed with ADHD because I brought it to my doctors attention. I had always had a problem in high school and even middle school with getting good grades, everyone thought I was lazy. In college the situation was getting worse, and I started to get depressed about my bad grades. I then realized my depression was stemming from my inability to concentrate on school work. It's been six months since I've been on the Adderall XR, and my grades have shot up! I get A's and B's in all my classes and am so much more organized which helps with everything in my life.",8,12
Adderall,"Double edged sword with Adderall. Great for concentration, brought my college GPA from a 2.5 to a 3.7, amazing. Although I do have trouble sleeping with it, and I often have mild bouts of depression, and roller coaster of emotion that I never have had before. Although it is important to state that this may be because I am not eating as much and forget to eat, which could easily cause these symptoms. AMAZING for athletics, I am able to run 3-4 times farther with this, really great. A nice feeling when its working and with  a definite comedown. Its important to mention I am on the IR version, which could be causing these side effects. My food habits are also now VERY healthy.",8,7
Adderall,"I take only 5mg a day but it works for my mild ADD.  This gives me great concentration and I can get things done.  Without this, I can't even read an article in a newspaper.  This is my life saver.  The only catch is I get tense TMJ from this.  But I lived with it as the benefit outweigh the side effect.",10,12
Adderall,"I was diagnosed with ADD at 21, as a junior in college. Before Adderall, I was an average student. I had a short attention span and difficulty efficiently completing tasks. The first time I took it, I read long passages and retained all the information. I actually follow my professors in-class. I didn't dread studying anymore; I actually kind of enjoyed it! I couldn't believe it. Within 2 semesters, my GPA has gone from a 3.1 to a 3.5.  There are only a few downsides that come to mind. First, I have trouble falling asleep at night. Next, I get irritated when studying/tasks are interrupted. Also, coming off of it, I feel extremely tired for at least 3 or 4 days.",9,11
Adderall,I had been taking Adderall (generic) for approximately five years but recently switched to dextroamphetamine because it was getting so hard to get Adderall due to (as the pharmacy said) a manufacturer backorder. But talk about serendipity; the dextroamphetamine makes me clench my jaw a LOT less than the amphetamine salts and as I begin to lose focus at the end of the day I don't get a headache to boot. So overall I have to say the dextroamphetamine is significantly better than Adderall on several levels.,7,17
Adderall,"Works well. Be sure not to take in evening or night just in the morning and noon though, because it will cause sleeplessness.",10,4
Adderall,"This medicine increasingly made my symptoms get worse. I became aggressive, ignorant, emotional and I am not a person who gets emotional. Note: I was 12. Please, watch closely if you give this to children.",0,11
Adderall,I have a vast array of psych problems from ADD to OCD to suicidal ideation.  Adderall was the first wonder pill for me. It made every other medicine I was taking more tolerable and more effective. It caused my mind to stop racing so bad.  Adderall changed my life.,10,15
Adderall,"Adderall has helped change the well being of my LIFE. As a child I had a issue affecting me. So, I tried to hide it because I was embarrassed but as an adult I finally had to own up to it after the birth of my child. I needed education so, I enrolled in College after a couple of weeks. I started to notice the same problems. I spoke to my doctor, was tested for ADD and was diagnosed. Since then I've been on 20mg Adderall morning and 10mg Ritain in the evening. I had only positive effects. I finally get to be the great student I always wanted to be and can finish my daily chores without forgetting things. I only hope that people quit trying to say this medicine isn't good for anyone. For yrs I didn't make the A's I wanted and now I do. People taking this medicine don't want to They Have NO Choice But To.",9,16
Adderall,Works great!,9,3
Adderall,"I have had problems my whole life with school, holding down jobs, depression and alcoholism.  Adderall has changed my life.  I am 43 and I finally have the courage to pursue the career I didn't think I would be able to do before.  I also take Prozac.  The combination does make me a little dizzy and I do sweat a lot more, but the miracle of being able to function on a daily basis and concentrate out way the side effects.",9,19
Adderall,"This medicine is amazing. I used to ALWAYS be the last one to turn in tests in High School. Now I take one in the morning and in about an hour feel like I am my true self. With it I can process information clearly, easily, and very efficiently. Now I have no problems with writing essays, answering in-depth questions, second-guessing myself. I even found that I am a lot more confident with many things (ranging from presentations to girls). I also take much better care of myself throughout the day except when it comes to eating for I do experience the loss in appetite. To describe it, it is almost like an auto tune-up program except for your brain! Adderall is absolutely great for me!",10,11
Adderall,"I was on adderall for about 10 years after I lost too much weight on Dexatrin. I began when I was about 10 and went all the way up to 40-60 mg a day, depending on how I felt. I was great for focus, but I definitely had sweaty pits, which I find really annoying. After Adderall stopped working, I switched to Concerta for 3 years, then to VyvanSe, which was incredible. All of these medications, though, made me feel like a schizo. Because I started so young, I got used to the feelings, but I would be a robot when I was on them, and coming down, irritable until I ate, then crazy hyper. Adderall did everything it was supposed to do, and because of it I was able to get into a great boarding school, great college, and now grad school.",8,12
Adderall,"The dosage of Adderall XR is variable from person to person within the established prescribing limitations that are an essential aspect of using this drug safely. That being said, I have personally experienced the efficacy of Adderall XR as being determined by being on the right dosage (not too little or not too much) of this very effective medication for Adult Attention Deficit Disorder.",8,3
Adderall,"As a child I always had problems with being very hyper and I couldn't pay attention like other children in my class. My teacher noticed it and told my mother about things that could help me. My mother had me tested and put on Adderall. Within a week I can honestly remember a change. At first it made me feel very funny and zombie like but after it got in my system my family said I was totally different person. I also suffer with dyslexia, but this medication helped me with that too. I was put on it when I was 7 years old. When I was 20 I stopped taking it since I was out of school. I couldn't hold down a job and things just got really bad for me. Then I had my baby boy and decided I had to be put back on it. Best thing that happened to me.",9,13
Adderall,"I've been on Concerta before and decided to try Adderall. I loved the results, ultra focused. At the beginning I was incredibly happy with it. Unfortunately, I had a severe allergic reaction to it. I'm not allergic to any other medicines but for some reason Adderall got me. If you get extremely itchy on the medicines stop taking it. I kept taking it for a while because I loved the results and the itching got really bad.",4,14
Adderall,Started Adderall 2 weeks ago. I am still trying to find the right dose. Doctor said start with 10mg morning and afternoon but if that's to much take 5mg morning and afternoon I'm finding if I take 10mgs and my day is really busy I am fine but if my day is not than I notice my heart rate and a need to be doing something. I'm not sure about this medicine yet but willing to give it a little more time. I just want to know if the feeling of needing to be busy will end.,7,10
Adderall,"I started on Ritalin for ADHD but I switched to Adderall, because the Ritalin made me extremely irritable. Adderall 20 mg allows me to concentrate, tune out distractions, and manage time efficiently. Negative side effects: suppressed appetite (positive for me!), SOMETIMES slightly irritable mood towards the end of the day, sleeplessness if I take it less than 12 hours before bedtime.",9,6
Adderall,"Well I have been on Adderall for about 5 months 20mg daily. I wish I would have taken it sooner though. I am a single mom of twin 5 year olds and I noticed that I needed this birth control. I couldn't even get out of bed, focus, complete and daily normal function, daydream, etc. I finally realized it was needed after my mother had her heart attack and I could not focus not even at work. I went to my doctors and he put me on this and I feel great 95% of the time. Weight loss great! I recommend this to anyone that needs something to really save them from spiraling down and not being able to be Normal Great!",9,17
Adderall,I was unable to stay focused or complete daily tasks. After starting Adderall there has been a vast improvement. My life seems to be in order.,8,11
Adderall,"I'm a 50 year old male diagnosed with depressive subtype ADD 15 years ago. I've tried Ritalin, Adderall, Dextrastat, Emsam, and various other antidepressants as I'm dysphoric. All these medicines have helped. Holiday's are good for resetting tolerance. Years ago, I needed 60mg Adderall in the morning and 30 at noon, after working up from Ritalin which became too weak. I'm on Prilosec for stomach acid now, and non-XR stimulants taken only in the morning still keep me awake at night, for which 0.5-1 mg of Klonopin cures. I don't get addicted to anything, so no problem, though nothing makes me feel really good either -even narcotics or sex! A well functioning mind and getting things done is my main high.",9,11
Adderall,Works great for ADHD but tolerance builds very rapidly.,8,9
Adderall,My wife started taking Adderal 5 months ago.  It completely changed her for the worse.  Sure she might be able to complete tasks and feels energized but the side effects are ruining our family. She goes from talking to screaming in mid sentence.  Violent behavior is now the norm.  Zero sex drive.  Total lack of regard for others.  I have talked to her about these issues but the responses are shut up. She has lost 20 lbs and looks terrible. By the way she was bulimic as a teen and into college.  So the weight loss is appealing to her.  I contacted the first nurse vacationer that prescribed it for her. He cut her off.,1,46
Adderall,"Adderall has changed my life. I have so much more energy, I'm more alert, and can stay focused on tasks a lot easier. However, I notice when it is starting to wear off, I get really moody. So, I make sure I'm not around people when that's the case. I was really worried about becoming dependent, so at least once or twice a week, I don't take it all to make sure I'm not addicted. Another warning, don't take this after 1pm. You will be up all night. It sucks. Your body will be so tired and you'll want to go to sleep, but your mind is just alert and wide awake! It really suppresses the appetite too but the longer you take it, the less effect it has!",9,26
Adderall,"Adderall has been hugely beneficial in allowing me to function with improved mental acuity, and I am able to take a relatively low dose to achieve these desired treatment effects.",10,15
Adderall,"I've been taking Adderall for 3 years and have experienced extreme nervousness, loss of appetite, trouble sleeping, dry mouth, dizziness etc. Adderall is not for all.",5,20
Adderall,"I began taking Adderall tablets, 15 -25 mg off and on, sometimes using Ritalin tablets instead. Both medications, although chemically different, have been bad for my sex drive. Adderall was preferable as it did not cause me to feel so emotionally vulnerable and 'weepy' as Ritalin. BUT learning that there's a neuro-toxic impact from Adderall that does not occur with Dexedrine has made me ask the question: why not Dexedrine? I do not enjoy the Adderall 'high' ~ I always take every medicine as prescribed AND vacation. Adderall helped me focus but *felt* physically mean. Now my psych doctor has prescribed Dexedrine ER. I look forward to enjoying sex again.",5,17
Adderall,I have adult ADHD. I'm 21 now and have been on Adderall 20mg 3 times a day for the past 4 years. It's really helped me if you just take it responsibly you don't have any real problems. The only thing I still get dry mouth.,9,8
Adderall,"I have been taking this for 3  months now and I feel we are getting somewhere.  I am taking 15 mg in the morning and 15 mg at 1pm.  I feel I could have the dose increased as I have only one side effect which is dry mouth.  No decreased appetite and no jitters.  I have decreased my coffee in take and am much calmer than I have been in years.  Before I had trouble with focus and gnatting about.  I know we are getting close to where I should be.  I am 44 and have suffered too long and so has my children, boss, friends, etc.",8,41
Adderall,"I am 23 now and I was diagnosed at the age of 8 with ADHD. I was put on Ritalin until I was 17. Ritalin made me stay up all night, it made me depressed. It was a terrible experience. Adderall really helped me, it keeps me focused and on task and just overall it has changed my life.",9,9
Adderall,"I recently began taking Adderall 15mg.  In terms of mood, I have become less anxious on Adderall.   Some people note increased aggression- I feel that I am capable of being more (verbally) aggressive because there is less anxiety to dampen the desire for confrontation.  However, I feel more capable of choosing whether or not to pursue confrontation. The other day at the bank, I calmly voiced my discontent over erroneous charges the bank made to my account (for the 3rd time!).  When the employee became a bit agitated, I decided to end the conversation rather than escalate the argument.  I was satisfied with my performance- I said my piece, got the closet thing to an apology I was going to get, and got out.   Adderall seems to make this easier- I don't feel as rev'd up as I would otherwise.  Our stress reactions to everyday situations like these are often way out of proportion to the stakes and Adderall seems to dampen down the reaction to something more appropriate.  It's a brave new world!",8,40
Adderall,"I started this when I was 27 years old, diagnosed as ADHD. I have had problems my entire life with struggling to stay awake (in general), excessive daydreaming, and socializing. This medicine turned my life around. Not only was I able to stop daydreaming, finish a task and make a list (for the first time ever), I felt more confident carrying on group conversations. I also lost a lot of weight, which I did need to do.",10,32
Adderall,It helped me control every aspect of my ADD. The only drawback is the short life of the medicine in your system before the half life begins.,8,12
Adderall,"I'm 16 and not diagnosed with ADD, but have struggled my entire life in school and am constantly failing. I have trouble paying attention, staying focused, and devoting time towards school and homework. Starting around last year I would come home from school everyday very tired and go to sleep til 7 or 8pm. I got prescribed to Adderall this year and it's made a drastic improvement. I have all A's and B's now. But the downfalls are I talk a lot (no I'm not on it right now), and sometimes I focus but on pointless things, and after it wears off I get irritable, anxious and emotional. I wish it lasted longer also. The medicine has kind of taken a slight turn on me and am acting different, and my parents have noticed a change in me.",9,41
Adderall,"I took adderall for approx. 6 years. I started off taking 10mg twice a day. The last year of college I was taking 30mg time release twice a day. I feel that I did benefit from the medication during my last year of highschool and throughout college. My grades were B's and above, and during the first three years of highschool I would jump for joy if I earned a B. So having said that, yes adderall did help with my ability to focus, retain information, and to some degree my determination to complete tasks throughout the day. There was a huge price to pay for taking adderall for as long as I did. My metabolism slowed down immensely and maintaining the same diet and exercise I am 50lbs heavier. Doctor told me I would gain 40-75lbs and I did.",7,37
Adderall,"I've been using Adderall for a few months. I have extreme depression along with ADD. I was taking Zoloft before and was scared that the Adderall might counteract with my Zoloft and make ma a zombie or suicidal. Well, the first few days of taking Adderall, I was light headed, weak, and didn't eat. After a few days of throwing up I finally took to the drug. My grades are going up in school. I'm losing weight. This drug really is turning my life around. The main reason I was on it was to concentrate and get my grades up. Adderall allows me to bring my grades up.",8,16
Adderall,"I have been treated with CNS stimulants (methylphenidates and amphetamines) and Adderall has unequivocally been the most beneficial medication for ADHD. I have been on this medicine, 30 mg twice daily, for about 4 years and all of the major symptoms of ADHD are under control which in turn has allowed me to take back control of my life.   I would like to add that, for me, it has had a profound positive effect on comorbid Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent (moderate-severe). Tried virtually every antidepressant and various combinations/augmentations since age 22 (except for MAOIs) with little improvement. Now taking Pristiq 50 mg in the morning and a low-dose of mirtazapine (generic for Remeron) at bedtime. No relapse/recurrence in over a year!",10,28
Adderall,"Hello I'm 42 years old. I always had trouble in school I quit at the end of ninth grade. Always had problems at work people always saw me as different. Never stayed at them for 2 years. I had also tried to go back to school and took GED test twice never passed the whole thing. Then I started a new job. I loved the work but my boss called me in to a room to talk to me. Said I was too passive. I fell apart could no longer do anything. My husband took me to my doctor. He tried different things, they did not work so then he put me on Adderall 20mg a day. He also put me on Zoloft 100mg at bedtime and he put me on Xanax. Saw improvement first day. Have been on them now since January 13th and I'm getting better every week. I love it.",10,43
Adderall,"I'm 25 yrs old, male and I started taking Adderall for Adult ADD 2 months ago.  My physician and I decided to give it a shot because I was having a terrible time at work (4yrs employed) doing the simple, but long term tasks/projects that everybody else were doing on time/completed.  Pros: Productivity up 300%, more attention to detail, finishing tasks, major increase focusing (easily!), major decrease in stress from cognitively/mentally draining myself in attempt to 'stay focused', more energy.  Cons:  severe initial 7-10 days side effects.  Still experiencing severe dehydration, dry mouth, nausea, dead libido, moody, increase in tobacco smoking, loss of appetite.  Fantastic benefits.  Side effects are still mild, if anything.",9,40
Adderall,"Was diagnosed with ADHD around 12. Didn't take any medicines regularly for years (risks, cost) but tried many. Got through undergrad without medicines but with lots of counseling/accoms, hit grad school and knew I needed more help. Began Adderall XR   regular in '03 at 25. Dose upped from 10-25mg over time. Yes, fixes concentration problems, makes you feel functional, driven, capable, great...but see more side effects like (super high blood pressure, low libido, binge eating when off medicines, moody/short temper). Worried about long term impacts on health - not being able to quit, sex life and inability to take it while pregnant/nursing.  Would love to hear from long time users in their 30s. Glad it helps so many people as much as it does. Life changer.",8,23
Adderall,"I suffered a brain injury from a work related injury about 3 years ago. What I was suffering from the doctor says was acute ADHD onset from brain damage. I could not concentrate, I was a bundle of nerves, I would argue with my family of little things it just didn't make sense. I couldn't accomplish any tasks at home. It was an awful experience. My doctor wanted to try me on Adderall and what a transformation. I am my old self again, I enjoy being with my family and playing ball with my son although I can't stay out long. I can concentrate on my work at hand. It also will make you not sleepy if you take it late at night. I take 30mg twice a day. It actually saved my life.",10,25
Adderall,It was very effective. My insurance will not pay it for me but Doctor gave me samples. I think I finally found the right medicine for me with other medicines.,10,10
Adderall,"I have taken Adderall for over a year and I have had great results. I take 20mg twice a day. I stay on task and accomplish so much more in a day. Initially, I was shaky and jittery and not sure about Adderall, but it was stopped and I feel the full benefits of the drug. The only side effects I would tell someone about would be 1) DRY MOUTH, 2)loss if appetite (good for me though), and 3) sometimes hard to get to sleep at night. These are trivial, given the amount of benefit I see from Adderall.",9,33
Adderall,I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in the first grade and was put on many different ADHD medicines like Ritalin and Cycler to name a few and had bad experiences with both so in the 5th grade I took myself off of them and my grade dropped to d's &amp; f's and I dropped out in 9th grade. Recentley I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was put on Depakote and Seroquel recently my doctor wanted to try me on Adderall and it has worked wonders for me. It has helped me stay focused and am able to sit still and it has helped with my bipolar disorder and I am no longer tired all day to to my pain management medicines. I highly recommend this medicine for anyone with ADHD and bipolar disorder. The only side effect is teeth grinding. Awesome medicine.,9,23
Adderall,"Adderall is awesome for (ADHD), that is what I have and when I take my Adderall I am able to focus and relax, which is just the opposite effect it would have on someone who doesn't have ADHD. It would act as a stimulator for them and is very addictive.",10,26
Adderall,"I was put on Ritalin when I was 6. I did not like it. I took myself off of it when I was 14. My grades plummeted, I developed depression, and then anxiety. I continued to become lethargic, and relied heavily on caffeine. I am now 25. I began to take Adderall recently due to severe trouble concentrating at work, thinking it may help me keep my job. Now that my body seems to be used to the medication I can hardly tell I'm on it. I have noticed improved memory, focus, and concentration. I did have some very adverse side effects accidentally combining with caffeine. I've found now that my body has adjusted I have no side effects and my concentration remains improved, and bonus, no depression. I do worry about cessation.",8,29
Adderall,Works well to reduce symptoms of ADHD.,9,5
Adderall,"This drug has been miraculous for me, it helps my fatigue and helps focus and alertness.",10,14
Adderall,"I've only had the brand name for a few days in a hospital, and it worked well with relatively no side effects. My doctor prescribed it after I got out, not knowing there was a generic. I was given the generic and it wasn't even close to the brand. I rarely get headaches, and I had a blinding one in my temples for 2.5 days. Brand name good/generic evil.",9,55
Adderall,Great,10,3
Adderall,I have benefited a lot with this medication. Only problem I have is taking it too late in the day and having insomnia side effects. Like right now its 3:30 am on a school night and I cant sleep! Do not take Adderall after a certain hour.,8,53
Adderall,"I'm 14 years old, and I've been on Adderall for 4 weeks now and I've experienced some side effects.  one of them would be loss of appetite especially in the morning and around lunch.  I've already gone from being 117 to 111.  That's not natural, my friend has the same problem too. I prefer Adderall though because my doctor told me that Vyvanse lasts for 12 hours and if you take it at 12 or 1 on the weekends, then you can't sleep till 12 or 1 in the morning. Adderall doesn't cause insomnia if you take it at 12 because it only lasts for 4-8 hours. Adderall really helps me pay attention in school, which is why I'm not failing out of my College prep school. Totally recommend Adderall 100%.",7,35
Adderall,"Works well, helps my focus during class and while doing homework. Concerta seemed to work better, but I think this stuff is doing a good job. It doesn't suppress your appetite as much as Concerta.",8,23
Adderall,"I am 62 years old on Adderall XL for ADD, on the medication for 4 years now. I find that Adderall does help when I first take it but seems to wear off as the day goes on. I get very sleepy while on the medication and have no problem with my appetite (no weight loss at all). I asked my Doctor to raise my dosage (I am taking 20mg per day) but he does not want to do it because of my age and concerns that it may affect my blood pressure, even though my pressure is normal now. I have no side effects at all from this medicine, just it is not helping my concentration as much as it did in the beginning, I think after a while the effectiveness wears off and an adjustment in dosage is needed.",7,80
Adderall,"I'm 24 years old and have taken Adderall over the course of 10 years. I know the only side effect I couldn't control is the stunting of my growth. I'm 5'7 and I only grew 1/2 inch in high school. I'm given 90, 30mg monthly. It has always improved my grades, however knowing that tolerance builds I do not take it all the time. Remember you have to take care of your body, especially your heart and liver, because long-term use side effects are still not concisely known.",8,51
Adderall,"I'm a mid 20s female who should have been on ADD medicines years ago, this is the only one I've tried so nothing to compare it to. Love Adderall because of the obvious side effects: take it in the morning and can get out of bed in 30 minutes without feeling the normal exhaustion I've felt my whole life first few hours of day, no appetite so in beginning weight loss and now weight maintenance, and energy throughout the day (until it wears off), almost like an extreme diet pill. Even though I have energy to run around and could get stuff done, seem to just run around aimlessly not doing anything with a point. I snap and have a temper that I never used to have.",7,89
Adderall,Changed my life.,10,20
Adderall,"I take Adderall for ADHD, simply put my GPA in college has literally doubled to 3.5, school is easy now. This medicine is like night and day. I'm glad it only lasts for a certain time 6-8 hours. I have zero appetite on the medicine and lost 15 lbs in two weeks when I started these pills. Aggression is increased. Adderall is amazing. Listen to your doctor and do not take more than you are supposed to.",8,71
Adderall,"I have been off and on this drug since age 17. My advice if you take it and it works, take it as directed. I'm a recovering alcoholic and I take it now as directed.",10,33
Adderall,"I was taking Adderall for nearly 3 years, when my insurance would no longer cover it. I started taking it when I enrolled into college. It helped me achieve the honor roll every term I was taking it. I felt more confident and focused, whereas in high school I was unable to do such tasks and received D's and F's. I wish that I was taking Adderall again. I've taken Ritalin, Methaline and now Dexedrine which doesn't compare to Adderall. I have been taking this for 6 months now, and I am no longer on the honor roll. No matter how hard I try, my focus isn't where I need it to be. On the other hand, I don't have the side effects of severe irritability or quick anger that Adderall tends to cause.",9,39
Adderall,"I was prescribed this medicine when I was a young child for ADHD. I took it all the way though my high school years until I decided I didn't need it. I backed this theory by saying It made me feel funny and zone out. I stopped taking it and since then I dropped out of school, picked up a drug problem and have been in and out of jail. I know I can't blame this on not taking medicine but I do know I didn't do any of that stuff when I was taking it. I was a pretty good kid. I recently got my G.E.D and am going to be attending college in the fall. I am actually trying to get back on this medicine so I can stay focused. I am excited to see whats in store in the future. But what I am really trying to say this drug works wonders.",10,79
Adderall,"I have ADHD and this medication helps with everyday life. I can focus on what I'm doing. The only real problem I have with this medication is the fact that it affects how I treat others. In other words I get agitated a lot faster.  I don't want to be angry and before I took this medication I would always turn the other cheek, but now unfortunately I get real angry really fast.",5,80
Adderall,"I have Bipolar disorder and have ADD (not ADHD) for which I was on Ritalin (methylphenidate).  My doctor switched me to Adderall because my concentration seemed to be waning again, but I don't believe it is working as well. Concentration is about the same, but it seems I am experiencing a lot more anxiety now than I did with the Ritalin.",5,28
Adderall,"I had clinical depression/anxiety for years. Worsened terribly after having 1st baby at 33. I was extremely fatigued, couldn't start or finish easy tasks, totally overwhelmed, cried constantly - major post-partum depression. Was prescribed Adderall, Wellbutrin and Zoloft. Been on all 3 for 1 year and am a completely new person. Adderall doesn't exacerbate my anxiety; in fact, I am less anxious because I can concentrate and don't feel exhausted, inadequate and unhappy. Might not work for all, but this combination is perfect for me. Upped blood pressure a bit, but still in normal range and monitored. Use with care with dose at start. I cut pills and take a bit at a time, always in the morning and only when needed during the rest of the day and never more than prescribed. I feel this lessens risk of dependency.",10,120
Adderall,"I took this medicine for ADD when I was eleven. I'd had some slight muscle tics before that and the doctor warned me and my parents that Adderall could make those worse, but at the time I wasn't too worried about it. That was a mistake. The tics got far worse, to the point that once I passed out because it made it difficult for me to breath. One doctor said it was OCD, and another said it might be Tourette's, and another thought it was the medicine.  All I know is I've stopped taking it and they've mostly gone away, though they still come back every once in a while when I'm tired. I'm not sure if Adderall would have helped my ADD; I didn't take it long enough. I've since managed to get it together and improve my grades without any medication.",2,32
Adderall,Before I found out I had ADD I had poor grades and I just couldn't sit still for 48 minutes or I would find myself sitting there at the end of class not knowing what happened because I zoned out. I was put on Adderall towards the end of my junior year. I graduated last May with a 3.6 GPA! I say this drug worked wonders.,10,46
Adderall,"This drug has changed my life. It has allowed me to focus not only on my job but also things at home that need attention. I feel smarter, I can think better and clearer. I find I tend to make lists and start checking things off the list as they are accomplished. I never start something and do not finish it as I did before. I look forward to it. I enjoy work more. I feel less stress and anxiety. I do not feel it is habit forming. There have been times when I have forgotten to take it and I did not notice it. The only difference is normally when I have taken the drug I don't have an appetite and when I forget to take it I tend to eat a lot.",10,107
Adderall,I find this medication controls the symptoms of my ADHD with no side effects,10,26
Adderall,"I just had to write and tell you that I feel like I should be a commercial for Adderal XR.  I am like every other typical mom.  I work part-time, go to school part-time, lead a Brownie Troop, take care of 2 children, a husband and a dog. All while keeping up with the normal household events.  Adderal XR has reformed my life and I am amazed by the difference it has made for me.  I am now able to keep a level head and prioritize.  I don't know how I lived without it.  Thank you Adderal XR.",9,81
Adderall,I truly believe this drug helps many adults. Just seem to get through their day a bit easier and if that's all it takes than so be it. Not everyone is able just jump into the day while wearing a smile.,10,42
Adderall,"This is the most amazing medicine. I've had problems with being unmotivated, overweight and depressed for years, and this drug can make me feel like a new person. Unfortunately, I'm stuck taking these pills just so I can feel productive. Oddly, though, sometimes even when I'm not on the drug, I feel as if I'm moving in fast motion, but my brain isn't. It's very strange but I can deal with it.",10,38
Adderall,"I am a 43 old women going on to menopause. I was never diagnosed with attention deficient. As a child I could multitask anything. When I reached menopause stage it seems as though I could not remember things in general. I would forget to finish several thing I was doing.  My stepson does have attention deficient so he has been on it for some time.  I asked my doctor about the situation of my attention span forgetting not finish task. So he suggested for me to try Adderall. To my surprise, I was able to concentrate, focus on my daily activity.  So I do recommend this to any women going through this crazy menopause.  It really helps you to be yourself again. Not feel like you are going crazy.",10,106
Adderall,"I have ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder, Fatigue, and Low Motivation. I also have Major Depression. If I didn't have adderall my dad would mostly see me staying in bed all day sleeping or just thinking. Adderall helps me a lot, it gets my brain actually working. It makes me want to do the things I loved before I was depressed and it kinda helps with the fatigue. My legs still feel tired 24/7 but I can move when I'm on Adderall.",10,78
Adderall,I can finally really concentrate and feel in control.,8,33
Adderall,This medicine has helped my son be able to control his impulse decisions and helped him be able to go to school and do homework.,9,33
Adderall,"This has worked very well for me. Am able to get things done without being all over the place, and actually feel great overall.",10,54
Adderall,It was a good medicine for me.,10,0
Adderall,I have taken adderall for 12 years for ADHD and it has done wonders for me.,10,71
Adderall,"Adderall is amazing.  It really works. I've never really been one to take medicines, even tylenol, but this drug has changed my life. Old me was cranky, according to my wife.",8,51
Adderall,"During school I struggled with learning, despite hard work I barely graduated. By the time I reached High School I wanted to give up. As an adult I experienced the same difficulties in employment. I became depressed, almost gave up. Fortunately I was tested for ADD. Diagnosis revealed severe ADD.  Within an hour of taking first dosage, my brain seemed to turn on and function at it's optimum potential. I felt truly alert, focused and clear headed. I found I could complete tasks competently. With out Adderall I'm useless. Adderall has improved my focus ability and competency in every aspect of life. It's a battery for my brain. I am dependent on Adderall for full functioning capacity. My well being and livelihood is compromised with out this medicine.",10,321
Adderall,"When I was in my last year of college I started seeing a psychologist for depression. After 6 months she screened me for ADHD and started me on adderall. It was ok for a while but she upped my dosage to 40mg per day. That was too much for me so I quit taking it. I noticed the difference when I wasn't on it. I felt way less focused, tired, and my moods were worse.  When I got a job with insurance after a year, I started taking it again. It has helped me tremendously! I only take 10mg per day now.",10,100
Adderall,Adderall has really helped me stay focused in school. Just be careful with your doses.,8,36
Adderall,I have ADHD and have been taking Adderall for 5 years now. I take 30mg in the morning and sometimes a 10mg in the afternoon. It helps me to focus in school and get better grades. I have gotten to the point where I will not even go to school without it.,8,57
Adderall,I have been taking Adderal  for 2 years now (3 of the 30mg tablets a day). It's a great way to get your work done in school and anything else you may need motivation to do. It also makes me more social and interesed in things I wouldn't normally be interested in. The bad thing about it is that if you go even one day without it you eat 3 times more than you usually would and you feel irritable and agitated. overall- coudlnt live without it,9,144
Adderall,"I have taken 20 mg of Adderall coupled with 50 mg of Zoloft for the past year.  They work really well together. Adderall helps me focus and Zoloft treats any mood swings or depressed feelings.  It really is a good combination for ADHD, ADD, or OCD.",8,130
Adderall,"Against the advice of my teachers, my mom decided not to medicate me as a kid since my grades were fine. As I got older, I got worse, concentrating was impossible for me and my grades dropped... my mind never stopped! I have been on Adderall for almost 9 years now. This drug saved me, it worked great! The down side...after this long, I have built a tolerance, get very irritable, and feel kinda foggy or dazed by the end of the day. I'm going to try something new for awhile and see what happens.",9,129
Adderall,"Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) immediate release has greatly (95%) improved my symptoms of ADHD including concentration, focus, memory, attention span, retention of imformation, and to some extent my energy and grades. It's a very strong stimulant so it does have temporary side effects, most will go away in two-four weeks like euphoria, anxiety, and teeth grinding but the dry mouth and insomnia if taken late will not subside for months, but it has helped me A LOT.",10,167
Adderall,"This drug has helped me a lot to improve my grades in school, very much recommended for people with ADHD.",8,58
Concerta,"Having suffered with Depression and ADHD as an adult, honestly this medication is a godsend. I'm only on 18mg (Extended release) and take it with Wellbutrin (for the depression) and I must say it's a life changer! (The X release makes a big difference - blood levels are more stable) No more emotional moods, no more crying, no more feeling like dying, no more negative thoughts. Also, you can concentrate for long periods of time and not get frustrated and be very clear minded. I can study for 6 hours straight! After trying so many medications, this just works.  Side effects: Fast heart beat, LOTS of energy and maybe a libido boost. Really good for adult ADHD and Depression.  Please note. Everyone is different. You might have a different experience.",9,5
Concerta,"It took a while to get used to but I weigh about 160 lb. and take 54mg daily now. Overall, it just makes it so much easier to be focussed and organized, with the meds I can actually keep routines. Biggest side effect for me is the appetite loss, I lost 30 lb within the 1st 6 months. Thankfully, that has lessened a lot and Ive gained some of the weight back but definitely something to consider if you have concerns about being under weight or disordered eating. As well, if you try to have caffeine, nicotine, sativa, or any stimulants youre going to feel like absolute garbage, so follow the doctors order and avoid them. Only other warning you might not find online is that the brand name Concerta is expensive and not always covered (in BC, Canada). It wasnt covered by my university health plan but its covered by my work plan with blue cross. For 90 tablets of 54mg Concerta (brand name, my doctor told me not to take the generic) it costs 400$.",8,9
Concerta,"I was diagnosed with mixed type ADHD at 25, far later than most. I started at 18mg and have been slowly bumped up to 36mg. Overall, my working/short term memory, energy levels, and mood have improved moderately. Unfortunately, I somehow burn through the medication in less than 6 hours and crash halfway through work almost every day. This drug has helped a lot but it isn't perfect for my brain chemistry.",6,6
Concerta,"I am in my early thirties and very recently started drug trials for ADHD. After trying Vyvanse which didn't work out I moved to concerta. On the lowest dose I had concerns, as it seemed to make my ADHD symptoms worse. I became more irritable and more distracted. After a week I moved the dose up the next level and had a terrible day. Extremely irritable, so lethargic I could do almost nothing all day, difficult time sleeping... I had difficulty dealing with my children if they did the slightest thing wrong. Concerta is not for me, I will try something else.",1,7
Concerta,"Does what its supposed to do, but makes me miserable while its at it.",4,4
Concerta,"I used to take the 36 mg dose, but it didnt really help my forgetfulness and sleepiness symptoms.",2,1
Concerta,"I was diagnosed a year ago after numerous diagnoses, with ADHD. I was put on Concerta 54 and I'm a different person. I'm happy, calm, still bit anxious but I'm better everyday. Fantastic medication",10,9
Concerta,My 9 year old son has been on 18 mg of it for a month now and it truly is a miracle! We literally noticed a difference in him the very first day. His appetite has actually increased! His sleep has not been affected..He actually goes to bed now the first time we tell him to. He will still express that he doesn't feel tired and that he doesn't want to go to bed but when we tell him that he needs to he just goes to his bed without the fighting or trying to do anything else to stop from going to bed.  He is more loving and affectionate now whereas before he was always so defiant. He does cry a bit easier now but it's better than the anger he felt before. He's helpful and considerate and empathetic. We reluctantly gave him this drug and it has saved my marriage and our overall quality of life has improved drastically. He did a presentation in school and received an A! Just try it.... You will know right away if this works for you..hopefully you are one of the lucky ones.,10,28
Concerta,"I've struggled with ADHD and depression for about half my life, I started this medication around 3 months ago. I take the 54 mg dose.  I've tried probably every antidepressant there is, and quite a few for anxiety. But this I think personally Concerta has helped quite a bit in regards to both. Because of it I've been able to wean off my antidepressant and no longer have to take it. The appetite suppressant does help me out since I'm working on weight loss, but it can also be a struggle to eat at times or find a food that is appetizing in general because of it. And the medication can cause constipation and dry mouth, which is inconvenient. Overall, I think it's helped me a lot in focusing on course work and it's intended purpose.",9,10
Concerta,"I've been on this medication for about 14 YEARS now. And I love it but hate it. It's considered an abusable drug now so getting and filling this prescription is absolutely insane. I have to take a pee test to get the script 4 times a year, then a pre-approval from the doctor, THEN I can buy it for $30 instead of $300. I wish I was joking. As far as the drug itself it's great! High focus, low appetite, it's great. The only problem is it makes my hand spasm and sometimes it can mess with your head. But all meds have cons.",10,12
Concerta,Works well,10,3
Concerta,"I have been taking this for 4 months now. I rather be on Ritalin LA than this stuff. But money. Right now I can only afford this because I am getting financial aid through johnson and johnson. The plus side with this medication is that it works when I have plenty of sleep, and have some sort of workout schedule. But right now being in school, it barely gets me to do my homework. But once I am studying, I can focus. So it does help. But I have zero side affects. The reason I liked Ritalin LA is because I never felt hunger, and the focus was awesome. Concerta is very clean, I react perfectly with it, but we work with what we can.",6,9
Concerta,"My 9 year old son has struggled for years, in school and at home. Impulsive behaviour, anger, inappropriateness.   I always fear the worst and avoided medication for 2 years.   Its been one week since he has been on 18 mg concerta, and its been a lifesaver.  He enjoys school now, not getting in trouble, hes so much better at home as well. No side effects so far, eating and sleeping no problem.  So happy we choose this path Hopefully self esteem and relationships can be saved:)",10,26
Concerta,I've severe ADHD was diagnosed  at 39  took a year before I was put on elvanse (lisdexamfetamine in UK) currently 70mg only problem it wears off after 4 hours can take manic impulsive spending or stealing stupid stuff. people with ADHD like to do risky things because  they get a dopermine release  both my boys were on concerta as children it affected their growth,6,3
Concerta,"I have been talking concerta 18mg for 5 years or so now. The first years were really smooth and it did really help me. Before getting on it I was suffering from depression and I almost dropped out of college due to the number of courses that I had failed, but then I was diagnosed with ADHD and since then, with a dose of  18mg/day  of concerta I managed to graduate. The depression never really went away but it definitely got milder. My panic attacks decreased to the point where I almost never had them anymore. A few years back, my doctor suggested to try taking the 36mg ones, but for me this didn't work because I felt kinda lost and foggy. So all in all concerta did wonders for me until half to one year ago. I have severe insomnia and I get irritated really easily. I had some milder panic attacks but I also had two that were really intense. I have lost weight even though I eat the same. In general I think that for me after 4-5yrs, the drug is starting to show its side effects.",8,8
Concerta,"This drug is atrocious, especially if you also suffer from bipolar disorder with psychotic features. I have increased anxiety, hallucinations, paranoia, and mood swings from this drug. In the meantime, it has done some things for my severe attention deficit disorder symptoms. Nevertheless, the side effects are horrible. I am cold, constipated, yet sweaty. I am in pain. I have extreme bloating whenever I am late by a few hours for my dose. The insomnia is unfathomably severe. I have undergone rapid weight loss on this drug. I have no appetite and must force-feed myself despite also being on antipsychotics. Do not even use methylphenidate stimulants if you have psychosis.",2,7
Concerta,"I started taking Concerta due to being diagnosed with ADD. I started off at 18mg and I could see a bit of a difference when it came to reading, writing, and focusing on what people were saying in conversations. It also helped with some of my impulsivity like shopping and binge eating. At my next psychiatrist appointment, we upped the dose to 36mg. BIG MISTAKE. Since Im Bipolar as well, it sent me into a dysphoric  hypomanic episode. I would get angry at everything around me and pick things a part that people would say, (its almost like a bad PMS episode lol).  This med works, just be cautious if youre bipolar.",6,8
Concerta,What is this stuff? It gives me a psychotic episode yet be incapable of increasing my attention span by five seconds.,4,3
Concerta,"This medication Concerta was excellent at first. It was like my miracle drug. It worked great for focus and gave me lots of energy. But before I knew it I was needing more and more of it for it to be effective. I got to the highest dose pretty fast, then it would make me totally crash at 2pm after taking it at 7am. So from 2pm to when I go to bed I am exhausted and can barely move. My attention gets bad and I got depressed.  So if youre thinking of taking Concerta just remember that at first its great but then it stops working.  I dont know how it is for kids, it might be totally different as I am in my 30s.",7,9
Concerta,I started taking Concerta when I was around 5 due to my severe ADHD which would cause me to get into trouble a lot at school and not be able to pay attention. Over the years it helped a lot with school and I had good grades and excelled in high level sports and the medication worked well for me.  Over the last summer I didnt take my medication and things were great and I was enjoying life. Fast forward to now and Im on a 47mg dose (27mg and 18mg pill taken at the same time) and have felt like I am a robot and have no emotions and it has effected my social life so much that my friends said that its like they dont even know me. Ive become depressed and started pushing myself away from people that I care about the most. This medication did help me but has now flipped my life upside down. I just had my medication switched to vyvanse and Im hoping that things go better than they did with concerta,5,7
Concerta,"I take a Concerta 54mg, it helps me a lot but there are two side effects. 1) Sometimes mucks up my heart's rhythm. Obviously, that's why I have these check-ups with my doctor to test my pulses and find any indication of a bad cause. 2) Drink alcohol after taking one and you'll maybe get some scary results too. It's better to skip out on it for 2-3 days before joining a party. Otherwise, great for your concentration and focus many times more than without. See that as a boost in your system.",9,6
Concerta,"I started Concerta in August after Vyvance gave me bad side effects. I began at 36mg and now I take 54mg. Being on this has helped me SO much with class work and anxiety- I no longer have anxiety spirals like before! Im actually interested in my uni classes, and Im getting better grades.  The best part of Concerta is that it stops my obsessive anxiety. I can control my thoughts now- this is something I was never capable of in the past. It gives me a sense of mental relaxation that Ive never had, and its life changing. I feel on edge, kind of jumpy, and alert, but no uncontrollable anxiety like before. At first, I had some weird side effects, like tics, shakiness, lack of appetite, and peripheral hallucinations, but these side effects are SO worth not having the terrible anxiety like I used to. Concerta helps me feel more sure of myself because Im not spacing out on information or having anxiety attacks. I feel more confident and capable. Its wonderful!",9,17
Concerta,"I have been on this medication (Concerta HCL) for a week now, 29-year-old male with ADHD. I have not found this to work for me and hope I can get something else. I take it early in the morning and feel nothing after an hour of taking it. The only thing it does for me is keeping me up at night when I need rest. I will say that when it does kick in at night I was able to focus more than before but, nothing has been life-changing.",2,5
Concerta,"Concerta has been a Life-changing drug. My studies have become more interesting and I have a long attention span. I wakeup before tests to study and have more motivation to do laborious tasks. It has helped with my learning disabilities in regards to memorization, math, and writing. I can read without checking my phone every minute. The downsides are you become anti-social, don't eat lunch and don't have much as a sex drive. Once the medication wears off you become hungry and return to normal. In my opinion, the benefits outweigh the cons. I do believe I have developed a tolerance so I will be upping my dosage from 36mg to 54mg in the near future. If you are struggling in school this medication is for you! I wish I had this earlier in my life so I could choose a more challenging major.",10,15
Concerta,The first day I took it I didnt notice a difference but once I started taking it and going to work I noticed a huge difference. I was actually working! I wasnt getting yelled at for sitting around doing nothing and I was actually finishing my jobs. It worked for a bit but we frequently have to up the dose for it to continue working and when I try to go without it Im irritable but so far the only times Ive ever been able to have a real conversation with someone is while taking this medication.,9,11
Concerta,"I literally thought I was going to die. I called my mom FREAKING OUT, heart palpitations, couldnt breathe, vision fading in and out, I walked home (I live in japan  its a long story), and passed out on the floor",0,7
Concerta,"My nephew stopped eating.  Managed to get about 500 to 700 calories a day.  At first it helped his ADD but after a short period of time didn't help at all.  He stopped taking it mid June, has grown three inches and put on 20 pounds.  At 5'6, he's still only 108 lbs.  I can't see how a medication can have any beneficial effect when one is clinically starving.  I haven't put him back on it.  We will have to find another med that helps but doesn't adversely effect his health.",3,8
Concerta,"I was diagnosed as an adult with ADD and was prescribed Concerta. It was helpful but I immediately developed a dry mouth. I have never experienced anything like this. The inside of my mouth was raw from biting it by accident. I drank over 14 glasses of fluid, mostly water each day. I could barely eat or talk my dry mouth was so chronic. I went off Concerta after taking it for only 3 months. It has now been 10 months since I stopped taking Concerta and I still have the dry mouth. It doesnt sound like a terrible side effect but it is. Im concerned Concerta has caused permanent damage to my mouth and its ability to make moisture needed.",7,6
Concerta,"Concerta was a total RIP OFF. I was doing fine on 50mg of Vyvanse. I started becoming more independent, more academically inclined, and more proactive. But I switched to Concerta after discovering the detrimental effects that Vyvanse had on personality and my social abilities. I continued taking Concerta 36mg for weeks, not realizing I wasnt improving on my academics AT ALL. I actually got worse. I had started procrastinating again as well as getting more and more temperamental. Even after switching back to Vyvanse, it hasnt worked the same ever since. My suggestion is, stick to the medication that works for you and try your best to ignore the side effects!",1,8
Concerta,Ive been on Concerta 27 for a few months now. Ive definitely gotten better in a way but otherwise I havent been improving at all. Im still doing bad in school and making stupid mistakes. Its been pretty useless.,4,6
Concerta,"I have stopped taking Welbutrin, another stimulant drug recently that I was taking with Concerta. The additive effect (sometimes can triple effects) was too much and I couldn't breath properly and had lots of heart palpitations. I was on 300 mg Wellbutrin and Concerta 54mg. Then I stopped Wellbutrin and went back to Concerta 36 mg. I was less oppositional and was more able to take the right decisions but more easily to be  distracted. I could still concentrate though but had to block outside conversations at work with music. Then my pharmacist did not get the message from the doctor when I asked to lower meds to 36mg. So I was force to go back to 54mg. I can more easily concentrate but I lost my snap decision making quick process and was less able to be organised in my daily life. I will try to go back to see the doctor. I prefer a little lack of concentration and being able to function then almost no ability to function or take decisions.",0,4
Concerta,Concerta is by far better then other ADHD meds such as Adderall in my experience. Is a milder and much better helps where it needs to and doesn't make me feel sick like Adderall did. I recommend this for also of you have anxiety. Adderall made my anxiety worse on it . Concerta helped me feel also less anxious because I have ADD and anxiety this helped so much .,10,22
Concerta,"I was put on 36mg Concerta in my 20s and it helped drastically. I was able to finally concentrate and read without having to reread things because I was distracted every .5 seconds. I lost my appetite and would get insomnia at times. I went from a size 16 to 8 within a year, which honestly helped my health and I was able to start going to gyms for the first time. I got off it when I moved overseas for 8 yrs and now Im back on it. The first couple weeks are a bit rough, it gives me anxiety and restlessness, its an instant laxative, and makes you pretty antisocial. But  remember your body adjusts and you start feeling more normal and less anxiety. However if I take 36mg and have any other stimulant like caffeine, I literally feel like Im having a heart attack and anxiety attack at the same time. Careful with mixing stimulants with this med if you have anxiety. Otherwise its amazing and works miracles. Also when I got off the 36mg my weight went UP so fast.",9,17
Concerta,"When I was first diagnosed with ADHD, I was put on a similar methylphenidate known as Matoride XL which is a generic of Concerta, though I had some issues with this drug - anxiety, depression, lack of appetite etc. And after a while it stopped working so well. I was put on Concerta 27mg and its been amazing. I am happier, and I am able to concentrate and contain myself whilst doing university tasks. Im hoping the effects wont wear off, only time will tell.",9,16
Concerta,I have been on concerta for 4 months it is a miracle  . I am a 45 yr old fit male . I weight just under 100 kg. My doctor recommended I start on 36mg and go up to 54mg. When I first started taking it it was like a miracle all the tvs in my head just stopped and I could focus on one thing rather than heaps of thoughts at once . I have had some of the above side effects but with time I just got better and better. I am confident a lot more rational and patient I have also been told this by my wife. I get more done than just procrastinating . I can actually make a decision now . The longer I am on it the better I get . At first it made me feel very quiet and I wouldnt talk much . I felt it took my personality away but that has balanced out. It makes me feel a little speedy but very relaxed and calm. Its amazing to not have my mind constantly bombarded by so much garbage. My wife calls it a miracle apparently I dont repeat myself and obsess so much lol.,8,13
Concerta,"Someone in the sea of reviews wanted to know how to make these medications last longer. I discovered a way but your not going to like it unless you stick to it, then you will discover the medication will be stronger, more receptive to your body, and last longer. Cut out all carbs. Eat a diet where carbs are lower than 30 carbs per day. The lower you go, the better the effects. Its also called keto. But I also do long term fasting as well up to 3 days, then eat , then repeat a few times a month. But for the most part, only living keto will benefit you the best. The most would be to throw in some fasts monthly.",8,11
Concerta,"I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD when I was in 4th grade. As a child I did not take any medication as I experienced bad side effects. When I turned 16 I started taking the medication in order to help with my school work. Now Im 22 years old and studying Engineering, the medication is really helpful in my academic life, however, it increased my depression and anxiety. Over the years Ive been taking it, the medication decreased in its effectiveness and I had to continually up the dosage. Im only saying this because for anyone who needs to use it they need to be aware and check themselves and their mental state. If you continuously ensure that it doesnt negatively affect your mental state and your personal relationships then it is a very helpful and life saving drug. Just be careful and aware.",6,16
Concerta,"I am a 25 year old male. I have had ADHD since I was a child and have struggled my whole life to stay focused on one subject at a time. I took Concerta 36 mg as a child and then stopped taking the medication because I wanted to experience what it was like to be off of the medication. I recently started taking the Concerta medication again due to having a job that requires an immense amount of focus. I have been experiencing some uncomfortable side effects while on the medication. These side effects include feeling more reserved as well as having mood swings. As far as focus, this medication is excellent for helping a person to focus on one subject or even goal at a time. I recommend this medication to anyone that has ADHD as long as that person does not experience mood swings while on the medication.",7,12
Concerta,I have been on methylphenidate 36mg for about 45 minutes.  I've been reading your comments the for this time.  I've read a lot of experiences however for younger adults.  I am 32 years old and would appreciate any feedback from women or men my age.,0,1
Concerta,"At the beginning I experienced weakness and headache, as well as occasional anxiety. But the more I continued to take the pills, the more the side effects disappeared.  I have been on Concerta for 8 years and it helped me a lot with my ADHD.  Recently my sister and I noticed I developed tics, but I am able to control it.",9,9
Concerta,"I turned to Concerta during graduate school because I simply could not keep my life together. 27mg in the morning was a game changer. Life and the world around me were just so much more interesting, my studies fascinating. When I got into the real word, it just wasnt working and I increased to 36mg which caused my jaw to clench. Withdrawal is hard. You are tired. I think it is best to do it over a vacation. 5 years on, I tried again. But this time I had developed certain anxiety behaviors surrounding my work and the Concerta greatly magnified these anxieties. So I stopped. In summary: 27mg is a great dose for me as an adult female. 36mg = too much  - not sure what the dosage kids are on, but please be careful! Too much of this drug is a very uncomfortable jittery existence.  - Be careful is you suffer from anxiety, this can make it worse. - Was a wonder drug for me - best used over a finite period to help achieve certain goals",9,13
Concerta,"makes you feel pretty weird for the first few weeks, I was getting headaches and crashing after a couple hours. However, your body gets used to it and after a while my performance on tests improved drastically, it did decrease my appetite quite a bit and i ended up losing 15 pounds. I took it for ADHD but was also struggling with anorexia so my doctor took me off it as it was making me lose so much weight. This medicine really helped me in school settings and I would recommend it in moderation for people struggling with ADHD as its not as intense at ritalin and only lasts for a few hours. I 100% preferred it to ritalin and lorazepam",8,14
Concerta,it helps yes but I have 90% of the side effects do not recommend,4,8
Concerta,"I'm a Male, 29 yrs old and weight approx 155lb. I was diagnosed with ADHD 5 years ago. I tried dex. but felt it was to potent, had bad crashes so I decided to stop taking stimulants completely. Until today, I decided to try Concerta at 27mg. In my opinion s ofar, its definitely smoother and calming compared to other stimulants where you feel wired. It also helped with my attention and focus. Only down fall is it only lasted literally 2 hours. I'm hoping it's because of the dosage so I'll see if I can raise it to 36mg.  PS if anyone has had the same issue with it wearing off to fast and found a solution, please share :) cheers!",7,20
Concerta,"Higher grades, acknowledgments from teachers and the ability to focus are the upsides. Wanna hear the downsides? I've lost all my friends, I honestly don't know what happened, I must have changed. I lost a dramatic amount of weight (from 220lbs to 145lbs in half a year) to the point where when I returned to classes after break, nobody could believe how skinny I was. A decline in self confidence. A scarily reduced sex drive. Sweat pours from me all day, even though I'm cold. A slowly declined desire to socialize, I don't even want to leave my room after school anymore. It's been over a year I hate who I've become, and at the same time have no desire to be my old self again. I've been on concerta consistently for over a year now. I've tried alternative meds to no avail and at this point I'm nearly an adult, thus I'm running out of time to fix myself. If you are a new patient and are experiencing these problems like I am, don't suppress them to keep the benefits, else you will have this mess to fix like me",5,29
Concerta,"My daughter was 9 when she was diagnosed with ADHD, but I always knew, but figured if it didn't effect her schoolwork, why treat it. Well, come 4th grade her teacher commented that her grades are okay, but she's much brighter than what she displays and is completely distracted. Just a week or so before the teacher meeting, I was just starting to think I would get her evaluated since she started to hate herself, getting in her own way (you ADHD folks know what I mean by that). She was put on Concerta and is now in honors math and a straight A student.  The best part was seeing her go from hating herself to loving herself and her owning how bright she is.  People would tell her she's bright, but she just didn't believe it until she was able to work up to her full potential. Also, afterwards I was diagnosed with ADHD and am having great success with Ritalin and will be switched to Concerta at my next visit.",10,33
Concerta,"I started taking Concerta about 6 months ago. The first month after being diagnosed with ADD I was on Ritalin, then switched over to Concerta. Im on the 72 mg of Concerta and it really has changed my life. I failed two classes in college before I started medication, and now I am doing really well in school. It really helps me focus in general as well. Ive lost 70 pounds since I started taking medicine for my ADD, so Im currently 140. This medicine destroys my appetite until it wears off. So I usually only eat at night. It also has messed with my sleep, so I make sure to take it by 9 in the morning so that it will wear off by like 10 at night. Whenever the medicine wears off I become super unproductive, but Im not sure if thats how I am without it or if its just worse when the medicine wears off. I really recommend Concerta, it really has helped me so much",9,26
Concerta,"Concerta has worked for me. Started when I was young, and then I had some bad side effects but that was because the dosage was to high, but even with those side effects, of extreme anxiety, hard to fall asleep, feeling unsafe and insecure, still the Concerta has helped me so so much, and my teachers were really understanding as well. This was a vital part in my education during the early years in school. I can safely say, that I have learned/gained experience from this medicine as well it really helping me out. The positives outweigh the negatives in my experience, but we are all different and you should really speak with the doctors and try to figure out which medicine is best in your case.  And the cost for my medicine varies from month to month, it works like a circle. At the start it is expensive, and then gets less expensive. Then the circle restarts and it goes to expensive to less expensive once again. Hope it works out well for you. And you can find the help you need.",8,7
Concerta,"I have been on methylphenidate for years. Moving from Europe to the United States had me switch to a different brand of methylphenidate. Have been on this medication for 3 months. The release of this pill is awful, I get peaks during the day of high and lows, they cause a rebound in the middle of my shift. And some time later I would be recovered and I would feel fine. I specifically have to ask my pharmacist to see if they have different ones. Its awful to drive to three different pharmacies to see if they have other generics.",1,7
Concerta,I love it but I experience about 80% of all side effects,8,5
Concerta,"My daughter used Concerta for 7 years.   It helped her ADHD but  since developed a psychotic disorder that is heartbreaking.  ADHD is a walk in the park compared to the psychotic condition.  While we cannot prove that  Concerta played a role, there is enough written about  causes of psychosis being linked to stimulants which Concerta is.  Before using I would recommend a discussion with a knowledgeable and caring physician preferably a good psychiatrist.",4,15
Concerta,Crash all the time and can't get through a full day of work,1,10
Concerta,"I have been taking Concerta for 2 years after I had heart issues with Ritalin to treat my ADHD. In the two years my grades have been well but I feel like I am losing myself slowly, I'm not as active and happy as I was when off medication. But recently I have been experiencing side effects more frequently with higher intensity. I am taking 54mg of Concerta daily except for Sundays. I have had a lot of shaking in my hands lately and it does not affect my daily tasks but it is really worrying since I never experienced this before. Anyone else having this issue? Although this drug has side effects it has really helped my grades. My advice is if you really need this medication be weary of the side effects because everyone reacts to the drug differently and from what I found online, not many people have had these hand tremors like I do when on Concerta.",6,14
Concerta,"I started taking Concerta a few days ago. It seems to have less side effects than Adderall. It helps with concentration and focus. However, when it wears off about 7-8 hours I begin to feel depressed and don't want to leave my house. I heard that adding Ritalin IR @ 5mg may help. So next time I see my doctor I will discuss this with him. I don't want to change my current antidepressant but if I begin to crash again I may switch from Lexapro to Wellbutrin which is also good for ADHD (off label use).",9,8
Concerta,"No effective, and bad side effects",2,3
Concerta,"I was on this drug all through my childhood and feel emotionally ruined because of it. My brain didn't have a chance to develop properly because it was on drugs all my life. When I graduated high school my parents stopped forcing me to take it and I've been off of it for 5 years trying to deal with the symptoms that are actually just manifestations of developmental trauma. (Read Scattered Minds By Dr Gabor Mate if you want to know what I'm talking about) All in all, don't push drugs on your kids. There are alternatives. I took a pill the 3 days ago because what I was doing wasn't working and I needed something extra and I had muscle pain and weakness and headaches for 2 days after, could barely sleep, and have had constipation since.",2,15
Concerta,"This drug is a life saver. If it wasn't for this drug I would be failing in college and sleeping all day. Concerta has help me study and lessen my depression symptoms. Its definitely worth the risk. The only downside to this drug is that it doesn't last 12 hours well at least for me. It lasts like 9 to 10 hours. Also as with other ADHD medicines, you can become tolerant to the point you don't notice it working. My grades improved with this medicine and I was able to write a 10 page paper in the 12th grade and a 25 page paper in my junior year of college. I'm even more organized outside of school. I wash my clothes and shower more on this medicine. I can finally read more without getting mentally tired as much. I wouldn't be able to pass my classes in college if it wasn't for concerta. EVERYBODY with ADD OR ADHD should try  medicine for it. I recommend concerta because it lasts throughout the day. It lasts longer than ritalin.",8,35
Concerta,"My brother was prescribed Concerta two years ago, and I feel the need to share his story so everyone knows how helpful this drug is for people suffering from ADHD. He is taking it and Strattera both for his condition, and the Strattera worked well for a long time, but when he was prescribed Concerta in addition to this to further help with his symptoms, it was just amazing. His breakdowns and tantrums decreased in number, he started doing his chores and homework again, and he started doing random little things to help other people out. This medication is a controlled substance, so it's harder for him to get than his other medicine-- he has to have an appointment with a specialist every two months to stay on it, though I don't think it's that way for everyone. He was born addicted to the painkillers my mother was on, as he was seven weeks early, and therefore has a higher chance to become addicted to substances in the future, but this does not seem to be a problem so far with Concerta.",0,41
Concerta,I am have been taking concerta for 3 months now and I don't see any improvement in my concentration when it comes to learning. 18 to 37 dosage. I think I going to have to stop concerta.,3,11
Concerta,"A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD and was first given Vyvanse. It caused me to have awful anxiety and chest pains. This turned me off to stimulants for a while. Finally, I started seeing a new Dr and he prescribed me Concerta XL for my long days at work and it has definitely changed my life. At first it was for my ADHD but it also helps with my depression. It makes me feel awake but not jittery and anxious. I feel more social and talkative (I'm very shy and people always make comments on how I don't talk that much). I don't have as many bad days like I was having before. I still get them but they seem to be more mild and less often. There is a slight come down period when it is wearing off and you can get a little bummed during this time. Its not as bad with the long acting Concerta like it is with regular methylphenidate. I highly recommend trying these medicines.",9,30
Concerta,"On this Medication I have experienced decrease in appetite, increase in libido, difficulty falling asleep, irritability, increased anxiety and times where I seem to lack positive emotion",6,21
Concerta,"Concerta works very well in the first years. Gradually  I started showing  many signs they have here, headache, flu like symptoms, I  cannot sleep, out burst of excitement, changes in personality,  nausea,  and skin rash and skin splitting.  I am going to change to another product  that does not have all these symptoms.",8,13
Concerta,"I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD/ADD at the age of 21 while at university, as well as mildly chronic fatigue, and was prescribed concerta; first 18mg (which wore off too fast) and now 36mg. When I first started taking it it felt like a miracle drug - for the first time in my life I felt awake, driven, and organized. Over time, it has become less effective - its definitely tolerance building - but it's still way better than going without.  I get chest pains and headaches sometimes, I have started getting mild anxiety (which I never had before), and I feel the cold a lot more than I used to. All of this would be completely fine were it not for the main side effect of concerta: weight loss. After around 18 months of taking it daily, my weight has gone from 130lbs to 104lbs - regardless of how much I eat.",7,29
Concerta,"I grew up with severe panic attacks. When I was 19 up until the age of 27, I stayed in my room. I couldn't leave my house. I had/have severe anxiety and depression Years went by and I lost hope. I didn't have a job; I was a loser. I took a mindfulness class and after each mindfulness tape, I noticed I was in extreme pain; more so than the other people sitting around me. It was then that I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I was prescribed adderall and Vyvanse for my adhd but they made me extremely tired. Currently, I am on cymbalta, concerta, and Remeron. With this combination, I began a full time job. I have been employed for 7 months and I would be lost without Concerta. If you're looking for a drug that is similar to Wellbutrin, Concerta is the answer.  Do not give up hope. Never give up hope. Don't take 'no' for an answer and if a doctor is diagnosing you incorrectly, leave and find a different doctor. There is a right combination of medication out there for you. Never give up!",10,36
Concerta,"I was recently switched from my Adderall XR 10mg to Concerta 18mg because my insurance didn't want to cover my Adderall until I tried Concerta. The transition has been terrible. I've only been on the medication for 5 days and it has been horrible. I was optimistic going in because I've never tried it before, but it has been a rough 5 days. On Concerta my restlessness is worse, I have no desire to eat because the thought of food disgusts me, I get headaches, I have zero motivation to do anything, and I feel extremely down/apathetic. I've heard this medication works for some people, but it was horrible for me. I'm so glad I can switch back to Adderall.",3,12
Concerta,"I was on Vyvanse but since I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, I wanted to try other meds to see whats the most effective. I tried Concerta and it was awful. It didn't do anything for concentration, made me feel nauseous, stomach aches and some crazy anxiety. Went back  on vyvanse! At least now I know I don't react well to Methylphenidate meds.",2,8
Concerta,"I've been on concerta for ADHD for  almost 2 months and feel better than in 25 years.  I also suffered with depression and anxiety.  My depression and anxiety are better, I feel alive and myself for first time in decades.  I can get things done. I forgot to take citalapram 20mg/celexa last week  and now haven't taken citalapram for 6 days and feel great.  I am concerned as when I tried to stop citalapram in the past I felt crazy and could not do it and that was using step downs method - this is cold turkey.  It seems somehow the concerta is offsetting weaning off symptoms so I hope this all lasts.  It is a life saver. I was so tired of being depressed, overwhelmed, pretty lethargic, overweight.  It is great to feel excited and not have food cravings.",9,21
Concerta,This med is the worst thing. I feel completely numb to everything. Only sometimes does it make my depression worse because I'm not able to express myself because of the numbness the medicine causes me. I hate I wish I could change meds but my mom and doctor seem to think this is good for me,1,15
Concerta,"It did help me to calm my brain, but it gave me a very fast heart rate, anxiety, and caused me to loose weight. My normal weight is about 140 and at my lowest on concerta I weighed 123. It did help with the ADD, but didn't work completely, so I stopped taking it because the side effects outweighed the help.",6,11
Concerta,"I was seven years old when I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Concerta.  I took this medication for three years and there were definitely a lot of changes. Yes, I was able to focus in school I remember that. I remember while on the medication I always wanted to try and do my best. But I was never hungry, never tired, never wanted friends, never wanted to talk. I was like a zombie. I remember being bullied by other students because they thought I was weird.  I remember crying all the time because I was always sad. Once I stopped taking the medication I finally gained weight and started talking; as well as paying attention in class.  Concerta may have helped me focus more, but it took away three years of my childhood that I can hardly remember now. I will never be the same.",4,21
Concerta,Like many others this has definitely changed my life also.  I can function and do things I never thought possible.,0,14
Concerta,"I have both ADHD and mild/moderate narcolepsy. I have been on concerta for 9 months. I had not taken any medication til I was a teenager (my parents were very against it) so I took Wellbutrin for a while to help with depression and my ADHD and narcolepsy however it was not strong enough, so I switched to concerta and am taking 36 MG. It changed my life. For years I could not go a day without taking a nap, could not focus at all in class. I just started college a few months ago and got a 4.0 my first semester which seemed impossible for me years ago. I can finally focus and stay awake, I cried a lot at first because I was so not used to this!! The only negative parts are insomnia, anxiety, and irritability. I recommend having the same bedtime every night and having something like melatonin on hand to combat this.   Also take your concerta at least 12 hours before you plan on going to bed. These side effects aren't horrible though, the good by far outweighs the bad!",8,17
Concerta,"I have a love-hate relationship with Concerta. The pros of the drug are that I can put two and two together, stick with mundane tasks (and look forward to them), read long, boring documents and catch errors, etc. The cons are the side effects- no sex drive, (sometimes) anxiety, a weird aura or buzz that lasts for awhile and depression. Lately I've been using natural treatments that are effective. Overall, though, Concerta did help me.",0,14
Concerta,"This medication was literally life changing for my son with ADHD (impulsive and hyperactive). He had impulsive, hyoeractive and aggressive behavior and they tried other meds like antipsychotics which made him worse! He started concerta (after I demanded a stimulant) and he is a different child - able to focus, not as impulsive and hyperactive and the aggression is gone!",10,17
Concerta,"My son, 11, had been on Concerta for two years. We took him off of this med because he was getting very aggressive, with me and his siblings, and also kept saying he was going to kill himself.",2,7
Concerta,"? am a 28 year old female with ADD and mild form of narcolepsy. Before Concerta, ? was tired and sleepy ALL the time and distracted. Its gotten to the point where ?t was affecting my work. ? thought enough was enough and went to my doctor. Concerta was the first medication he prescribed and its the best. But we experimented with Adderral (good pill but knocked me out at 7:00pm after ?t wore off, so ?t didnt address narcolepsy) and Ritalin (heart rate was just insane) and Vyvanse (gave me anxiety that I never had). With Concerta ? have 0 side effects, ? am never sleepy anymore (but sleep well at night) and distraction levels have decreased significantly. Giving ?t a 9 because ? am not at 100% with focus. ? wish it were slightly stronger.",9,27
Concerta,"For a while it was good, I was doing okay in school and focusing more, but the more I increased my dose the worse the quality of life became, my social anxiety went through the roof. The worst part about it for me was that when my dose was 72 mg the cutoff or withdrawal was horrible, as soon as it wore off my face would get a big red rash and would pulsate, and my pores would get huge, this would happen everyday, and it was irritating and made me self conscious, so I took myself off the medication and noticed it stopped. I havent been on it since and I would like to start a new medication with less side effects.",4,8
Concerta,"This medication worked fantastically for me! When I started taking it I was at the bottom of my class, struggling at school, and within 2 years I'd moved to the top. It totally transformed how I was able to concentrate.  I always felt like this allowed me to 'be the real me' because it gave me the focus and patience to do the things I wanted to do. It helped me socially because I was able think and communicate better (more tactfully!) In terms of side effects I can't take it too late in the day or else I wouldn't sleep at night, but nothing else. I know some people have described many more side effects but I didn't get anything like that. The only downside is that after 19 years on the drug, I don't find it as effective anymore.",10,17
Concerta,"Concerta makes you focused and and concentrated. If you wanna get stuff done you can get it done in a breeze. You wont notice that your enjoying what your doing, what I mean by that is like u know how homework is boring and especially if you have ADHD you have impulse problems, when you take concerta its like when your doing it, time passes by a lot and you wont notice. Like you look at the time and for example its 2:30 while your doing your homework like I said the time will be 4:00 when you look back at your phone",9,24
Concerta,I am a 20 y/o girl. I was on 54 mg of Concerta once a day. This drug was the worst thing thats ever happened to me. It did help my grades but I felt most of it was placebo and the fact that the side effects were so horrible I wanted to focus on work to distract myself. It made my anxiety unbearable and constant. My heart beat in my head. My whole left arm and pinky would feel numb and prickly. I knew I was hungry but could not eat and was disgusted by food. I fell into a horrible depression and felt just overwhelming darkness. The pros was that it made sitting in long classes and retaining information much easier. I felt excited about learning and getting work done. Overall it helped with school but the side effects are not worth it.,2,32
Concerta,"It's amazing how much more focused my 16 year old son is, since he started his daily 36mg Concerta.  His work effort and work quality is improved dramatically.  Yes, managing his food consumption has been a bit of work.  His appetite is definitely not what it used to be, but we're working on it.  Although it's only been 3 weeks, we are all thrilled with his response.  Good luck to all!",10,18
Concerta,"My son has severe ADHD and Autism.  My son was graduated to 36 mg time release Concerta.  His behaviour did improve very slightly, however, he lost nearly 10% of his body weight in a short 3 months.  We  could hardly get him eat.  We started to supplement him on an immediate release 10mg Ritalin tablet before school and it was an absolute miracle. We removed the concerta and then increased his Ritalin to 10mg three times a day and its like a new child.  While its the same drug, the delivery system is completely different.  I firmly believe that the digestive system needs to be looked at for each individual taking Concerta.  For my son, the delivery system of the Concerta did nothing positive",0,18
Concerta,"Terrible experience. My son is affected with ASD and ADHD. We gave him Concerta for one day by prescription. All symptoms have worsen dramatically, He became extremely nervous and did not sleep a half of night.",1,8
Concerta,"I was prescribed this by my doctor and it was terrible. I stopped taking it after 5 days because my doctor told me to. It made me angry all the time. It did not help my concentration. Also, 3 days after taking it I still have shortness of breathe, my heart is still beating hard, and the left part of my chest has immense pressure on it. I'm never taking this stuff again. Trust me, nobody needs it.",1,21
Concerta,I have a nine year old son who was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of six. We tried Focalin first and it made him extremely weepy. A month later we tried Vyvanse and had a good experience with it for three years. There was a major rebound effect but we felt lucky to have some relief from symptoms for the hours that we did and dealt with the negatives. We moved from CA to a high altitude state and his meds went haywire. We tried Strattera for two months and he had a stable mood but zero focus. We started Concerta two weeks ago and are extremely happy. We aren't dealing with an afternoon rebound!!!! He is pleasant. He can focus. We are hopeful that the good will continue. I suggest trying this drug or another one if you aren't 100% satisfied.,8,24
Concerta,"In early elementary school I was diagnosed with ADHD. It's not common for females to have it. I started on ritalin. It helped, but I stopped taking it in high school because I was worried about the stigma. In University I took it off and on. After graduating, I took it only during major changes because it helped me cope, but I never wanted to rely on it. Now I'm trying to get my career going in the field I want to be in and I'm stressed out of my mind. I have anxiety and my family doc is concerned I'm going through depression. I'm back on Concerta and have been for a few days. It is the 18mg dosage, but while I feel a bit more focused, sadly I feel more focused on my emotions. Hopefully when I move up to 27mg I will be less forgetful and anxious.",8,21
Concerta,This drug has cause way to many side effects on my 12 year old grandchild. Has cause her body to over develop very fast.,1,14
Concerta,"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, which I didn't think I had until I started college. Things then became more clear! I started off on Adderall, which I hated because it made me irritible, jittery, and I found it totally unhelpful. Weary the of stimulants, I switched to Wellbutrin, which helped, but only a little. I decided to give Concerta a shot, as my psychiatrist told me it's like a more specialized version of Ritalin, and I've been amazed by the results! It lasts me most of the day, and I can finally focus on work and conversations! My quality of life is so much better now that I'm on Concerta. I take the 27mg XL dose.",0,28
Concerta,"I was late being diagnosed with ADHD, (late 40s) I was diagnosed Bipolar in 1992, but never felt this was the correct diagnosis as my meds never helped me with all the different thoughts going on in my head. As soon as I started concerta, I felt more relaxed, my concentration improved greatly and I could sleep peacefully without any benzodiazepines. I am currently (for over 4 years) on a dose of 72mg, it still is as effective as when I started and luckily I haven't any of the listed side effects. I think if anybody feels they have ADHD they should seek Psychiatric help to do the relevant tests.",9,43
Concerta,"Had ADHD symptoms growing up, due to cultural reasons and beliefs, family always dismissed it.  In 2nd year law school at the moment, had to work 5x harder than others. Started living away from family and finally got ADHD diagnosis done. Was prescribed concerta.  I was 154cm height and 47kg before concerta.  Titration period - 18mg 1 week, 27mg 1w, 36mg 3w and 54mg 8w. 18-27mg at first was amazing. No side effects, brimming with motivation but, wore in 4h. 36mg, was ok but wasn't as great as the initial effect, wore off after 4h. 54mg, developed an uncontrollable cough, mood swings, dry mouth, anxiety. Lost 5kg weight. Now on Vyvanse. Cough took 2 + weeks since quitting concerta to stop. Advice - if side effects are bad &amp; lasts 1w+ change meds!",2,23
Concerta,"I'm 21 and I've been taking 72mg (two 36mg barrels) a day since I was about 17. Concerta changed my life. I was failing school and no matter how hard I tried, it didn't change anything. I became depressed, slept for 14+ hours a day, I gave up. Then I was prescribed and it changed my life. It keeps me focused, motivated, and energized. Though, the side effects are very real. I don't sleep much, which is why I usually don't take it on weekends to catch up on sleep. It kills my appetite, so I eat a big breakfast before I take it in the mornings. It does elevate my anxiety, and not saying it's something I suggest.. but I smoke cigarettes to help that. Oh, and I don't know if this is common or not.. But it keeps my digestive track regular!",10,54
Concerta,"I have been taking Strattera 60MG for 6 months and am a Male that weighs 185LBS and is 6 ft 2 in. The ATX(Strattera) was not enough to help my severe unmotivation. I recently added on Concerta (alza 18mg generic) to my medications and it has helped dramatically.  Like a pair of eyeglasses, I can now see my life in a better light. It will not get your work done for you nor will it solve all of your issues that you may have, but it will make life a LOT easier to live. Instead of always worrying and being behind, I can get what is real important done and get to what is important another day. My mood has not been bad, my driving is less road rageish. I'm a LOT less stressed out and anxious. I'm blessed to get help at age 22. I am doing well",7,41
Concerta,"I was recently prescribed this and let me tell you even with it being a stimulant it has helped my anxiety, I can explain things a lot better. I can focus more - my brain isn't all over the place. I feel a lot more confident my form on my workouts are better, I'm losing a lot of weight though. At 27 years of age I was recently diagnosed with aspergers because of social situations. I am now 28 as I type this. When I was a kid I was first diagnosed as learning disabled. Throughout my teens and early adult hood I was diagnosed with social anxiety, and depression. But I do not care, because my symptoms improved dramatically. I have a really good doctor and therapist. So that's helping as well.",0,48
Concerta,"Male age 47 adhd sufferer.... Been taking concerta xl 36mg for the past 12 years now.. To start with, I didn't understand how the drug would help me.. But now Looking back it has proved to be a fantastic drug that has tweaked the way I live my life.. But I say this with caution, as its not perfect and it caused me a lot of other problems.. Like someone has said on here before it doesn't turn you into a fully focus person. Sorry. Well it hasn't for me but it has helped me over time to stop beating myself up on that bloody roundabout in my mind, and gain a little bit of confidence..Balance of mind ultimately came when I was prescribed antidepressants.. So I use concerta at 4am and antidepressants at 8pm..",7,24
Concerta,"Personally, I hated it. During my time on ADHD medication I was almost always in trouble at school, failing classes, suffered from mood swings, from the first grade to the end of the ninth grade and also looked anorexic during that time. Once I got off the medication, I could finally feel like a human being and was happy, but I gained a surprising amount of weight that (5'9 and 110lbs to 5'9 and 162lbs) I have spent the next three almost four years trying to replace the fat with muscle. Getting off the medication was the best thing to happen to me as I could actually pass my classes and graduate high school.",1,20
Concerta,"Concerta has helped me tremendously in school. My grades skyrocketed after only one semester of use. The first day, when I was on 18mg, I could already feel the effect.  Now, I only take concerta (27mg) on school days and other days which I know are going to be exhausting. Even on the days I don't take it, I feel happier than before. Concerta  gives me motivation so I can actually live, which makes my motivation stick around. I can now socialise without feeling like my energy has been sucked out of me after one conversation. I can now do my homework and chores. I do things in my free time, instead of crashing in bed after a day of school. Though my appetite changed, and I lost a lot of weight, I have a lot to thank concerta for.",7,47
Concerta,My 12 yr old son has been on Concerta ER for 9 months after switching from Metadate. He responds quite well to it and his grades are fantastic. He is much less mouthy on it... and rarely gets into trouble at school.  So far.. so good.,9,35
Concerta,"I am a 20 years old and I did exceedingly well in high school and nursing school without ADHD medication. Once I graduated and moved into the workplace, my ADHD spun completely out of control. I had a very hard time adjusting. This medication has helped me think clearly, focus on tasks and stop me from being so impulsive and rude. My appetite has gone down for sure, but I try to focus on superfoods I can eat in small amounts. I think it's important to have coping strategies and work through your ADHD before jumping straight to medications. I would highly recommend this medication for adults who are struggling, not for children though.",10,32
Concerta,"I took Concerta from 3rd to 11th grade, then again for about a year right after graduation, I ended up forgetting to take them for a while and just started taking them again. For me it takes about a month to actually feel the full affects of it. One thing to keep in mind though is that it doesn't help you focus on homework or work...it just helps you Focus, whether it's on homework or your emotions.",10,24
Concerta,"When I was 9 my grades dropped and remained at a c-b average compared to my usual a. It became harder to socialise and eventually I started skipping school 3-4 days out of the week. I had anxiety problems and was on the verge of depression. At the age of 12 my Mom in a last ditch effort put me on Concerta, which did not magically fix anything but within the next 2 years I was attending school regularly and my grades got better.(from an Asian family, grades are everything) I have to say I'm much better but I took a 8 month break and returned to a 36 dosage which makes me sick all day, headaches and problems sleeping. I can barely eat a half a meal without having to force it down.",8,13
Concerta,"My daughter's pediatrician told me to give her 1 pill before 9:00 a.m. daily.  I gave her the pill at 8:30 a.m. and all day she was amazing then suddenly out of no where at 10:30 p.m. she said she just couldn't fall asleep, her hands and feet wouldn't stop moving, her mouth was moving extremely weird, and she said she was jittery. My daughter finally fell asleep at 6:30 a.m. and didn't receive another dose again but had problems for 5 more nights with sleep.",1,21
Concerta,"I've been taking Concerta since 2003. For me it's the only ADHD medication that works. It calms me down, I talk at a speed others can understand and my thoughts don't run off. The side effects I get from it are .loss of appetite(growing up I was underweight for this reason) . Trouble sleeping(I ended up needing a medication for this but am currently not on one) .Dry mouth (drink lots of water).... I have also been diagnosed with major depression and bipolar after years of taking Concerta (diagnosed in 2007 and 2013 respectively (both are genetic in my family)). Drugs effect each person differently. If you decide to take Concerta I would suggest keeping track of you side effect and how often they occur and talk to you M.D or N.P.",9,26
Concerta,"My 10 year old was prescribed Concerta after having an allergic reaction to Adderal. Well this was not much better. He was nauseous and dizzy and his resting heart rate was 160. He only took 1 dose, and he will not be taking any more. Awful stuff",1,13
Concerta,"I am 30 started taking this due to excessive daydreaming and quite frankly not getting anything done. Could not focus for more than 10 minutes before a thought would come and get distracted by it. Apartment was in a mess. Priorities are all over the place. Wanted to do so many things and all at the same time. So I went to the doctor and left with a prescription for Concerta 18-27-36mg.I don't know if he had the right diagnosis but shit is getting done and everything is great. Less tired, less naps, did not take a nap since I started this. Now I'm at the 36mg step. Truth is the drug is only 10% of the solution. Once you know you can do something, you have to keep that mindset and go with it or else you will take this drug forever and ever.",10,60
Concerta,"Ive had a history abusing Adderall here and there due to my addictive nature so being prescribed this medicine raised concerns between my family and doctor. Because of my horrible ADHD we decided to give it a chance and its nothing compared to the 'kick in the nuts' Adderall is known for. My grades have improved in school, my mood is slightly elevated and my cavings for sugar have ceased. It has not affected my sleep and so far works great. This is my experience and everyone reacts differently. I highly suggest this medication for anyone like me who has ADHD and possible addiction issues. Its rate of abuse is very slim because it seems to 'ceiling' like Suboxone for opiate addicts. Lets go build some robots!",8,27
Concerta,"Was on Concerta xl for 7 days and had to come off it due to the unbearable side effects of the drug. I  was diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive sub type) generalised anxiety and depression. This drug made me feel very nauseous, gave me a headache, made me shake, gave me twitches throughout my body, messed my brain up in terms of cognition etc, made me very aware of my heartbeat, made me extremely anxious to the point of not being able to leave my room or communicate with anyone and just generally messed me up. At one point i was doing some stretching on a yoga mat to try and calm myself down and i felt so confused that i didn't know what to do with my legs. This drug wasn't for me and caused an unpleasant experience.",1,27
Concerta,"So i was diagnosed with inattentive type ADHD about a month or two ago. I'm 19 and in second year university. I struggle to take in information in distracting settings like big lecture halls, have  tough time focusing, and my organization skills have always been poor. So my doctor prescribed 18mg concerta. I've taken it for a week so far and I'm loving the results. Im now always listening in lectures, always focusing on what the prof is saying. My room, car, desk is now more organized than it has ever been, and its stayed that way so far! Many people complain about lack of appetite but I haven't noticed that at all! Ive noticed two minor side effects so far. Headaches that start later in the day, as well as some minor irritability.",9,51
Concerta,"I've been on 18 mg concerta for 3 days. I'm a 39 year old woman with ADHD-PI with anxiety.  The 1st day I felt fluey and extremely tired, but very mellow and happy, nevertheless it didn't do a thing for focus/Attention. The 2nd day I felt inconsistent fluctuations with my mental clarity/focus. Also, there were fluctuations in Tiredness, I had to drink caffeine twice in the day on order to kind of function. Also my appetite became enormous. I still felt quite calm and centered though, which was nice for a change. 3rd day was more of the same from the 2nd day, but my appetite was less. I'm wondering if I should keep taking this.",5,16
Concerta,just got diagnosed with add and im 19yrs old the doc prescribe me 36mg concerta and this my second day taking the pill and i still feel the same,1,10
Concerta,"Been taking Concerta XL for a while with a steady titration from 18mg up to 81mg. I take it around 9am each morning and the first few hours are very restless. However by early noon say 1-2pm I go into a slow sometimes dragging comedown which makes me sleepy and therefore having a knap during the day. This leads to an almost sleepless night which can upset my brain in many ways. Positives: Alert, talkative, sociable and above all CONCENTRATE. Negatives: Jaw Clenching (gurning), sweaty, sleepless night (because of the midday knap) All in all I have tried alteting dosage times in the morning and I can quite easily eat without feeling nausea. Weight loss is noticable but at a good stable rate. Many people have to give Concerta a chance.",8,21
Concerta,I'm 16. I was prescribed 36mg Comcentra  I took it at 8:30pm (was suppose to take it in morning) it worksd it helped me focus but 3 hours into it I started feeling anxiety and later I had a crash. Couldn't sleep stayed up the whole entire night. I also has many other side effects like lack of appitite and heavy breathing might be to large of a dose but overall without the crazy side effects it helped me get stuff done and concentrate,8,18
Concerta,I've been on Concerta XL for 3 years now I have two large (36mg the highest dose for my age) every morning. I suffer from ADHD well ADD and it really helps me feel motivated and helps me look forward to things. I lost 4 ish stone and went from 16.7 stone to 12 in 4 years as my adhd made me eat when I was bored/sad/happy and It really ruined my life. I don't have an appetite anymore and only eat in the afternoon once it's worn off. I do drink a lot of fluids as on the tablets I get thirsty. I'm more social and i enjoy everyday activities a lot more including chores. Negatives : the come down is awful and I usually slip into a depression but it is worth it ! I'd recommend it to anyone !,9,24
Concerta,"I've been taking Concerta XL for around 2 months after finally being diagnosed as and adult. I started on 18mg, and within half an hour, I felt able to concentrate and focus on tasks for the 1st time. A couple of days later, I had crippling headaches but everything settled down after that. My resting heart rate has sped up by 10bpm whilst the medication is in effect. I'm currently on 54mg and the therapeutic effects are great, but I feel dehydrated no matter how much water I drink, and I have developed sinus problems. It's worth it though.",8,26
Concerta,"I was prescribed Concerta 54mg for two weeks, and after two weeks my dosage was lowered to 36mg. The positive effects: First of all, it was absolutely effective at keeping me focused, engaged, and gave me the motivation to continue working away at my given tasks. It also accelerated my perception of time. The (manageable) negatives: It made me so focused on tasks that I was antisocial. Fixating on annoying sounds, anxiety, sweaty palms, no appetite, and weight loss (25lbs). I found I was lacking emotion, and during the long comedown I was irritable and rarely I experienced mild to moderate depression. Concerta is an effective ADHD drug, but the emotional effects can be annoying at times. It is worth consulting your doctor about!",8,31
Concerta,"I'm 17 and have been taking 18mg Concerta every day for a week and a half. This is the second medication I've tried after being diagnosed with ADHD (I was also diagnosed with major depression). First I tried Adderall, and while it made me feel very alert and productive, I could not handle the severe depressed feelings from the comedown. So far Concerta has made me feel productive and positive for about 3 hours, and then depression slowly creeps in and gets progressively worse for about 8 more hours. It's not as intense as the depression from Adderall (which even led to suicidal thoughts), but it lasts longer. I also become irritable, anxious, and tired. I've also lost weight because trying to eat makes me feel queasy.",2,22
Concerta,"Yes it helped a lot and i love the fact that i can concentrate now because before i couldn't concentrate at all. The thing is that after a few hours, i start to feel really depressed and really emotionnal but i love the fact that i can express myself better now.",7,17
Concerta,"18mg dose, day 1. Was hungover so took paracetamol, had taken ritalin as a kid and this is the first time I had meds in years, had a migraine, was irritable, tunnel vision, extreme anxiety almost brought to tears, slight suicidal tendancies, hallucinations relating to anxiety and had a hard time articulating myself as my memory was shot and my thoughts were rapid and I felt impulsive and dehydrated very easily, however I feared worse effects from withdrawels so I took it again the next day and I played abit of guitar and that set my mood for the whole day, constantly euphoric. ive just passed day 3 and hardly felt any effect off the drug, overall remained productive and achieved everything I wanted even on worst day. Will see how it goes.",3,12
Concerta,"Do yourself a favor and stay away from this drug. After being on this medication for about a month I began to experience auditory and visual hallucinations, appetite loss, insomnia and heart palpitations. It did nothing to relieve my ADHD either. Doc tried lowering the dosage and changing what time I would take it, but it made little difference. I flushed the rest down the toilet and stopped taking it after 6 months.",1,31
Concerta,"I have been using Concerta for many years. It has helped so much, but the only downside to it is it makes me lose weight. I went off of my meds for about three months and gained 50 pounds. This was because I had the habit of eating whatever I want whenever I want and not gain any weight. I was an A  student and as soon as I went off my meds I was getting Fs in all of my classes. I then went back on my meds and within three weeks of me being back on concerta, I lost all of the weight I had gained(because I had to make the habit of not eating so much within those three months), I raised some of my grades to As and some to Ds. I still passed 7th grade because of my circumstance.I have ADD, ADHD, and Cerebral Paulsey.",10,23
Concerta,"I  am  male,  50 years old and recently diagnosed with ADHD.   Started taking Concerta almost 4 weeks ago, and  much like everyone else, started  at 18mg dosage and now  at 54mg.   I'm not really sure how Concerta has affected me in  my daily life yet,  accept  perhaps helping me getting into deep sleep and dream again.  there are number of symptoms that I like to share with you: -     I wasn't much of a forgetful person to start with,  but now I  tend to forget things -      definitely  low libido and ejaculation issue -      lack of appetite -       lost interest talking to people  specially woman/ mind you, I'm single -        no problems sleeping, though I  also take   10mg  Cipralex",8,13
Concerta,"Today was my first day taking concerta. I am 19 and have pretty severe ADHD and a little anxiety that coincides with the ADHD. I took 36mg at 8:30 am and kicked in at 10. I definitely noticed it, I felt alert and energetic but not focused, and I still found myself pretty forgetful before leaving for work. By the end of work I felt really emotionless and had a head ache, and when I got home at 6 I began crying for no particular reason. After crying I felt much better and focused very well on school work. Now I feel happier but surprised by how much of a roller coaster the whole day was. Overall I'm not sure this is the medication for me, hoping this reaction is normal and it just takes some time to adjust.",5,17
Concerta,"Iv'e been on comcerta 2 weeks now n just gone up to 36mg I've had ADHD all my life and only just been diagnosed, always wondered why I can be anything I want end up going off the rails! Anyways this medication has basically changed me in a good way, I think if u really have ADHD this medication works n only doesn't work when u haven't got it! First week struggled sleeping but fine now, n theres no loss on my appetite I just don't crave the sugar n junk food that I used to so its a win win for me coz I'm a boxer and been in sport all my life! I can focus proper n its basically a miracle, for me, so far like :)",10,44
Concerta,"I've been on this medication since I was 9 I'm 21 now. I've always had trouble in school and it has helped me a lot to concentrate but without it I can't focus at all. I became too dependent on it so now that I am in college I cannot study or find any kind of motivation to stay focused if I'm not on it. It wouldn't be a bad thing if it didn't make me depressed. Recently in this past year I've been taking it almost every day again and have been feeling sad for no reason, always thinking negative and very irritable until I put two and two together. Now trying to get off once I am done with school next month for good.",3,26
Concerta,"I began taking Concerta at the age of 13 to treat my ADHD. I'm now 22, still taking 27MG of Concerta daily. Overall it has been helpful with managing my ADHD symptoms, I'm much less distracted and able to stick to one task at a time. It was especially helpful when I was in school because it was just so impossible for me to stay focused in class. As an adult it makes work so much easier for me because my job requires things to be done with a lot of precision. Side effects I've experienced have been headaches (occasionally migraines), inconsistent appetite, restlessness at night, some difficulty sleeping and constant thirst. Despite the side effects I feel that my overall quality of life has improved with taking Concerta to manage my ADHD.",9,50
Concerta,"Unbelievable! I think and concentrate much better , focus, it does effect for men a little down below, but it makes you focus so you are very hi libido. Men know what I am talking about. It is great for that you mind does not wonder.  I've only been on it for a week, it works immediately. And yes you worry because you can see things so good, and you are not used to it. So I get scared, that should go away. try it. you don't like, try something else, controlled substance, hard to get. Psychiatry will get this for you, and you need prior authorization depending on insurance.",10,19
Concerta,"I'm 18 years old and have been prescribed 74mg of concerta a day. 3 pills in the morning and one in the afternoon if needed. I had been diagnosed with serve ADHD and this drug has changed the way I learn and study dramatically. It's amazing how confident and focused I am now. I always feel so good on it too, until I'm starving to death. Concerta absolutely kills your appetite. Sad part is I can not even force myself to eat and it has already taken a tole on my weight. I have always been insecure with my body so it is nice losing the extra pounds, however I don't enjoy talking to anyone at school anymore. Even though I feel good all during the school day, I am quiet and hungry.",8,38
Concerta,I've been taking concerta for 3 years now and I'm 18. I started out with 18mg and slowly went up to 54mg. My grades went from really low to average in weeks but the side effects are really crappy. I have troubles sleeping at night and I feel things that aren't there. I also have a big loss of appetite and have to force myself to eat sometimes. I have days where I get really depressed to the point that I don't want to get out of bed and do anything. I also feel really anxious and on edge and I start scratching/ picking at my skin which gave me scars all over my back. I thought about it and went off the pill and my grades suddenly dropped again. The pill really does help with focus and motivation but the side effects are really tough!!!,4,42
Concerta,"Found out I had ADHD my sophomore year &amp; was put on this pill. Started at 36mg and I could definitely see changes. Very moody, could not go to sleep at night, I always so jumpy and on the go, but I will have to say it helped A LOT with my troubles on paying attention in school. Went from D's &amp; F's to an honor roll student. The only thing that's really scary for most people is the weight loss it can cause. I weighed 130 my freshman year and in the middle of my junior year I was 94 pounds. So you really have to watch that!",9,29
Concerta,"I was diagnosed with ADD at the end of grade 6 and started taking concerta in grade 7. I had no idea I had ADD and just though everyone was like me. I had no enthusiasm anything with school but after I took concerta I was like ADHD. So much hyperness and wanting to work. After raising the dose to 36mg I started to get very anxious about my heart feeling like it was beating too fast and was having like a panic attack or something so then I dropped back down to 27mg. The side affects I have is weight loss/loss of appitite, heart palpitations, sleep paraylisis, feelings of excitement. It works for me but I hate the side affects. I also lost 5lbs in one week when I first started and 20lbs in 2 years.",8,27
Concerta,"I have been taking this for 10 years (started at 18 mg, went up to 36 mg). Recently (several months ago), I developed several horrible side-effects. For example: it made me feel nervous. I could not keep still. It also made me extra irritable (to the point I was yelling at my friends for the littlest things). I also felt depressed (to the point I did not want to get out of bed at all) and could not sleep. The doctor brought me down to 18 mg, symptoms did not improve. I immediately stopped taking this and felt 100% better the next day. The doctor put me on Adderall XR which works a lot better with very little side-effects. Please avoid Concerta if possible.",1,52
Concerta,"This is not the drug for everyone. I was absolutely miserable on Concerta. I was restless, anxious, needy, fidgety, irritable, and depressed. My psychiatric practitioner attempted to cure these symptoms by prescribing higher doses. I eventually had a meltdown. As soon as I stopped, it was like I was instantly better. I know this drug works wonders for some people, but please be careful.",1,44
Concerta,I have my son on weekend's and he never seems to want to sleep and he is skin and bones he is rarely hungry?,0,26
Concerta,"I have been using Concerta for 15 days now. I started out with 18mg for a week and the second week 36mg. I haven't seen any difference by now, which is very dissappointing for me. In fact I feel slighly extra depressed than I already am, but no big difference. Starting tommorow my doctor told me to take 54mg per day. Any suggestions? Is it too soon to see any difference?",1,12
Concerta,"I am in grade 12 and I have been on concerta since grade 3. I have noticed I am underweight and I have trouble sleeping at night. But concerta has helped me focus in school, but I just wish it didn't come with some of the side effects.",4,23
Concerta,"I don't feel right,  I can't focus, I don't want to workout which I love to do, I don't want to drum which i love doing too. I felt great on biphentin despite the anger I tried concerta for a day and hated it",1,17
Concerta,"The only reason I gave Concerta a 2 and not a 0, was because when I didn't take it for two days I could feel myself going through a withdrawal. I would begin to feel tired, annoyed and angered easily, some headaches, and so on. I have been on Concerta for about 13 years and even with it in my system I still struggled in school. At first they had me on smaller doses, but they had to be increased. I've been taking 108mg each morning and the only thing that I have noticed a difference in is the withdrawal I go through, which can be helped by drinking coffee. By the way, I'm currently on the drug right now and I'm supposed to be studying for my spanish exam that I have this afternoon. So if that doesn't tell you something then idk what will.",2,18
Concerta,"Doctor started me on 27 took that for 3 weeks for severe ADHD and it lost its effect so I was put up to 54 mg and amazing changes I get work done fast and I am motivated only problem is Crash is pretty awful for me, I get really sick to the stomach and drowsy. For the sick stomach I just use ginger but drowsyness can't do anything",8,20
Concerta,"My daughter see and hear things that are not there.  She has been taking concerta 36mg for over a year.  But all of a sudden, she is so scared of everything.",6,31
Concerta,"ADD/ADHD has always been an issue, sure - grades sucked, concentration lacked, motivation gone. But, when the doctor prescribed Concerta, that all changed. I felt a change and saw my grades and concentration get better and better. The appetite loss was a minor issue. I've always been a big eater with a super fast metabolism. When I was told I was a few pounds overweight, I was happy. The solution to the problem is to force yourself to eat. It's not a bad sacrifice if you see a positive difference in your performance. I'm 65', 17 years old, and 210 pounds. I'm skinny, sure, but I'm willing to sacrifice quite a bit so I can do better in school. :)",9,47
Concerta,"At the age of 10, my son's ADHD was needing medical help. He was put on Concerta18mg and was a little unwell for two weeks, with sick stomach, lack of appetite, and slightly listless. Made sure he ate breakfast before taking his tablet. He did look a little thin after about 1 year. We persevered with Concerta and life quickly improved until almost all ADHD problems had disappeared. Did not increase the initial drug dose. But after 18 months, he was becoming quiet and withdrawn. Decided to stop Concerta. Mild withdrawal symptoms for a week or so. We have never looked back. He is now 14, not on any medications and is a tall, healthy, teenager. Wow, recommend this tablet. He may need it again some day.",10,44
Concerta,I first started taking Concerta about 2 years ago. I'm almost 13. It works okay but I have been losing my appetite far too much. I'm already really underweight and this drug makes it worse. I've also run into sleep paralysis once or twice.,4,26
Concerta,"I've been taking concerta for close to 15 years now since I was diagnosed at age 3. Around 8th grade I had started getting pain in my chest which was similar to costo condritis. The pain got increasingly worse up through highschool and the beginning of college around age 18 when it stopped affecting me as much. Now I'm 21 years old (as of the 12th this month) and for the past years I've been noticing that I've been getting increasingly anxious and worrying more than usual. In the past 5years on a daily 63 mg dose I've been dealing with depression, anxiety, nightmares, insomnia, loss of appetite, and I've lost 30lbs due to that. It's effective, but at a price, sometimes one you can't afford.",6,30
Concerta,"I was diagnosed with ADD about ten years ago. I was prescribed Concerta by my doctor and it wasn't an easy transition. I got tons of work done and all, but it killed my apetite during lunch hours and as a result I lost weight. As time went on I got more used to the medication and I've since regained my weight (for the most part, I've still got a high metabolism and as a result gaining any kind of weight is difficult for me) and can still focus on my schoolwork. Part of this can be attributed to getting older and all, but I think the medication has certainly helped. For reference, I'm a 6 ft tall guy who weighs around 125 lbs.",9,25
Concerta,"Well it started in 2014 when I was diagnosed with adhd.... And I could not focus for more than 5 minutes before doing something else and this has helped me greatly focus and calm me down.  We also own a farm and I drive a skid steer loader and drive a tractor, also doing fieldwork takes a good deal of focus and now I can easily do 5 hours of bale loading and not get distracted which is a lifesaver. One downside is that I lose my appetite but not a big deal to me.",9,29
Concerta,"I was diagnosed with ADHD a little less than a year ago at the age of 12. At first, I loved it because it helped me get so much work done and I stopped getting in trouble and annoying people. After about one month I started realizing that I wasn't eating because the medicine was destroying my appetite, and I liked it. I started using the drug more for weight loss than anything and I went from a happy, bubbly 115 lbs to a lifeless 95 lbs. at 5ft8in, that's severely underweight and unhealthy. I kept taking the medicine but I became increasingly more depressed and anxious. I was an outcast but I was too obsessed with losing weight to care. After the school year finished, I took a break from the medicine and I am now a happy, healthy 13yr old.",4,31
Concerta,"I've been taking Concerta for nearly five years now and just recently it hasn't been working as well as it used to. I was diagnosed with ADD in 6th grade and was then prescribed this medication. I've been taking it ever since. But back in May, I started to notice that I was having a much harder time focusing. It was almost like I hadn't taken it at all. This was very unfortunate since at that time I was having my end of year exams. I've also seen that others have been having the same problem. I'm looking forward to having this sorted out because my ADD is very bad and makes it very hard just to function in everyday life.",6,23
Concerta,"I first started with 27 mg or concerta when it was giving me no effect my doctor increased to 54 mg. At first I loved it. So great...motivation, energy, concentration etc. But then I realized how bad my anxiety was getting and that my prozac was no longer controlling my anxiety and depression. Concerta caused me to have very severe migraines which cause nausea and dizziness. I would have a migraine in the morning and the only thing that would take it away was the concerta and as soon as it wore off around 5-6pm there came the migraine again!  &amp; I obviously couldn't take the concerta or I'd be up all night. I am not switched to vyvanse but haven't tried it yet. If concerta did not cause migraines and anxiety then I would really recommend it.",7,19
Concerta,34 years old diagnosed back in Oct 14 started meds at 18mg fine 1st day then no real benefit after that  I hoped the increase would help did for a while. Now on 54mg and I'm not in a great place and emotionally feel low  and feel desperate. My relationship has broken down I'm hoping tomorrow I can change meds,5,12
Concerta,i started taking this medicine at age 10 for about 1 year. i took it and it made me feel really like as if i was depressed and it made me feel no hunger.i never ate until the medicine would where out by the end of the day that shen i would start binging on foods at night time. the medicine was useless. and btw i still have adhd and it doesnt affect anyone or myself.,4,14
Concerta,Love this. I was first prescribed 27 mg and seen no changes but with the 54 it is perfect. I am able to focus and do things and not get irritated with background noise.,10,24
Concerta,"I was initially diagnosed with ADHD-combined hyperactive and implulsive when I was 16. Up until that point, I struggled with my attention issues and excessive energy and it became increasingly difficult to cope with the symptoms as I got older. My doctor prescribed me Concerta 54 Mg once a day. I immediately noticed significant improvements. I was able to think more clearly and communicate coherently. At the same time I noticed that I had a better ability to control my attention and remain focused over a more prolonged period of time. My grades improved and my relationship with friends and family became much better. I'm now 26 and still taking the medication. The therapeutic effects are still evident.",10,59
Concerta,I absolutely love this medication for my ADHD and as a mood stabilizer. It works wonders with little to no side effects. Coming down from it in the evenings is another story .. My coming down period sucks as I just get consumed with rage.,8,32
Concerta,"I'm 50. I was in school before ADD and ADHD were a thing. Those of us that couldn't pay attention or behave got C's and D's, and we liked it that way. I'm kidding, we didn't like it that way and neither did our parents. I muddled through high school and even got a college degree, but I really struggled. I remember when I first heard of ADD and meds that treat it, and it was a revelation. I've tried many of these medications and Concerta is my favorite. To me, it's the smoothest.  The short acting drugs hit too strongly and then quickly crash. Hard. I had been taking Metidate CD until an insurance change made Concerta cheaper. Concerta is smoother than Metidate.",9,38
Concerta,"I was first diagnosed with ADD when I was 6 years old, I'm almost 28 now,and have been on Ritilan and Adderall for most of my life. I went off medication a few times in my life and although I was functional, I found myself spacing out a lot, and unable to focus. Recently I had been under so much stress that I was experiencing more frequent zoning out especially at work. So I talked to my doctor about it, and he originally prescribed Strattera but my insurance company wouldn't cover it so he put me on 20 mg dose once a day. This is only my second day on it, but overall I've had little negative side effects. Just a minor loss of appetite and some dry mouth. I am definitely feeling a lot more focused and can still sleep. So far so good.",9,24
Concerta,"Ok this is where i am after two weeks. I'm turning 54 one of these days, Managing Director of my company and self diagnosed with ADHD about a month ago. I matched ALL the criteria. Went to see a doctor and he confirmed my suspicions. I relayed my struggles with studies at University and he referred to me attaining two degrees a 'miracle, I cannot begin to explain how difficult studying was not to mention having to sit through hours of lectures. There was no - and I stress - NO filter between my brain.mind and my mouth. Anger,profanity and impulse behavior was only curbed by my life-long ability to be able to fall asleep anywhere, anytime. Imagine an alien being in charge for 53 years. It's all gone. Why did no one help me with this before?",7,76
Concerta,"I've started taking Concerta because of ADD when I was 21. I went to see my doctor, I was explaining to him that I had difficulty keeping up at school since I was a kid, but the only reason I'm in University was because I was in art school. He prescribed me concerta. If anyone took speed before, it's exactly the same effect. You do get a down. You are more focused. You loose weight. However, you can go to sleep at night. The problem is, I don't take it everyday, I think it's a little bit too harsh for me. I'll go see him again, maybe I have psychological issues. It DID help with my sleeping: I always fell asleep in the afternoon, it took everything I had to stay awake ( at school, at home, at friends house) I was known as the sleeper.",6,21
Concerta,"Started on 18mg and did not notice any difference in my ability to concentrate, but noticed that my appetite had decreased. My dosage was switched then to 32mg and I noticed that my attention span had increased slightly but the more noticable change was to my mood and my anxiety. My hands shake from this medication and I get hot flushes although my hands are cold and clammy. I sweat more unconsciously and this is uncomfortable. I went back to talk to my psychiatrist and was told that side effects tend to even out, and sometimes an increase in dosage can speed up this process, so I went up to 54mg. Although the medicine has made a change in my attention, my appetite has gone in the day and I have lost around 7kgs.",8,22
Concerta,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 7. And started taking focalin soon after I was very impulsive and couldn't focus. When I was 11 I started Adderall that would keep me up at night. And I was dependent on it. Last year (13 yrs old) I was on 31 mg of concerta the first day I took it. I was lightheaded and nauseous. I am almost 14 and I take 27 mg of Concerta it has helped immensly with social situations I am now a cool kid. I still struggle with school and am not very hungry. But overall I think concerta is a good fit for me. On a average day I eat a small breakfast of toast and a fruit or veg, skip lunch(not ever hungry) and eat a light dinner. On the weekends i don't take it and I have the muchies all day.",8,43
Concerta,"I have been taking conserta 54 and 36 (legally )for many years now the only main side effects are that it cause you to lose your appetite , twitch a bit. I don't think its for everyone.",9,23
Concerta,"From school right through to starting college I was a lone wolf. Didn't like many people, got into a lot of fights. Was not bothered about doing well. People only stuck by me because they were scared of me. At the age of 16 I got into smoking a lot of weed and made myself even more of an outcast. Turned into a brain dead idiot. One day I tried amphetamines or 'speed' as its known as. Everybody else got high, I got a better job. Went back to college, became really popular, got girlfriends etc.. Eventually all that went down hill as street drugs are unpredictable. Went Doc's for help, was diagnosed with ADHD apparently had it all my life.vDoc put me on concerts 56mg daily. Pretty much the same effects as the speed. Love it   no sides:)",10,44
Concerta,"I've been taking concerta for the past five months. When I first began taking it, I would get headaches and appetite problems, but those side effects dissapeared after about three weeks on it. Concerta has not only improved the amount of work I'm able to accomplish, its improved my self esteem as well. I no longer feel as shy and cluttered as I did before I started taking concerta. I like that it lasts throughout the entire work day, so I don't have to worry about redosing. Overall, concerta has been a very positive experience for me.",9,70
Concerta,"I am currently a junior in high school on concerta going onto 4 years with it and I can honestly say it does work very well. It helps me focus a lot and you can see the results inflicted on my academics and how good they got. But the side effects are the down fall of course. I get insomnia and I lose my appetite completely for a whole day. And on top of that I feel emotionless, like a robot that all it wants to do is study and focus. It takes a toll on social life, but I guess that's the price we all have to go through when taking medications.",7,34
Concerta,"I really like Concerta. I was on Adderall before but had really bad anxiety and sleep side effects and even more side effects, so my doctor gave me a Concerta prescription and I took it and felt so energized and focused. I love Concerta so much the only complaint would be it lowers my appetite and gives me a bad mood sometimes but I use Prozac to balance that out and this medicine is amazing, I tested it on video games and kept winning because how focused I was. This medicine is great for ADHD I highly reccomend it.",9,43
Concerta,"My son started Concerta 18mg a little over a year ago at 9 yrs old. What a positive change for him!! His self-esteem was back and he was social and smiling all the time. Made new friends easily and enjoyed things other than video games and TV. Lately, we have noticed a change...his concentration is not as good, he has trouble getting organized at school and likes to stay in his room for hours at a time. He reminds me of the kid he was before medication. April 1st, we have an apt with the pediatrician and I am assuming we will up the dose to 27mg and hopefully find our happy boy again! We have also tried Biphentin, which did not work for us. Concerta has been a life saver and I hope it will continue to be with the proper dosage :)",8,44
Concerta,"After a diagnosis of ADHD, ODD and RAD the psychiatrist prescribed Concerta. So far after 1 week of use, the hyperactivity, aggression, and zoning out has either stopped or come to minimal.  The side affects seem to be weight gain and loss of appetite.",10,28
Concerta,"So far so good. Love the extended delivery system. I am taking 54, does not last as long as they claim.  I am 46 just started with meds about 6 months ago. No bad side effects!",10,36
Concerta,I was diagnosed in my late 40's with ADD.  Dr. Put me on Strattera which was fine except for the severe nausea in the morning even taking it with breakfast.  Just could not deal with that so was switched to Concerta.  Loved it.  No side affects.  Could be off of it on the weekends and go back on it on Mondays with no issues.  Dosage was 36mg.  About 5 years of taking it and perfectly happy.  Switched insurance company and continued with my medication then as of the first of the year will no longer cover Concerta.  They want me to try all the cheaper formularies.  Now I am struggling with all the other options they have provided and no success.  Doesnt make sense!,10,28
Concerta,"Concerta helped me so much. Before Concerta, I dreaded doing school work or even regular household chores. While on it, I want to do my homework and chores. It makes me 200x more focused overall, which means more learning and better grades. I went from C's and F's to A's and some B's",10,61
Concerta,"This medication is amazing!! Be patient and try it! All ADHD medications (like any other medication for anything) have side-effects but I have learned Concerta's do go away once you let your body do the talking: push through the 1-6 days of anxiety/depression/hyperactivity, etc., and be open to what it can do for you once your body gets used to it. I am 21 years old and I am on 54mg AND I take a side-effect medication called INTUNIV XR (2mg) that cured the anxiety side-effect which I found to come about half way through the day and when the Concerta was wearing off. This side effect comes about because Concerta is not a gradual release but 2 releases of the medicine- it drops off and may cause anxiety for a short time during the day.",10,36
Concerta,"Simply amazing! I was on Concerta from the age of 11-17 it worked, but didnt really appreciate its qualities being a young lad...I came off it. Since then life has gone dramatically down hill and I have had issues with keeping a job, focusing, social acceptance....the works! I had no commitment to anything and no drive to establish myself in the world. Im now 24 and have been back on them for 9 months. Since then I have been 100 milliom times more productive. Secured an amazing job (and held it down) even won a few employee of the month awards! Ive also gained a new amazing social circle and my relationships generally have never been better. Small side effects i.e sleep issues. But will never stop taking unless forced.",10,45
Concerta,Concerta  it was the only medication that work for my ADD I am 53 years old. I took a break from it for four years now I am going to start it again because I am not getting anything done during the day. I am a nurse.,0,49
Concerta,"My 11 yo has been on concerta for 2 months. The first few days he did experience some nausea although went away. After the first week I could tell a huge difference in his attitude.. He suddenly had a sense of humor, engaged in conversation without being distracted, and was bringing home/completing homework with no trouble! His grades have immensely improved!! I can tell a difference (not huge) on the weekend days he doesn't take it. Or if he didnt sleep well the night before and when it begins to wear off in the evening he tends to be a little grouchy. Only other down side I've noticed so far is that he has lost approx 4lbs/mo which is concerning if it continues. So far, happy with the results!",9,16
Concerta,"I like this medicine since it last 12-14 hours. It helps depression as well and it helps me in college. Without it I wouldn't be doing as well. It helps me stay on task and focus so I can get my work done. There isn't much side effects to this stimulant, maybe insomnia and a suppressed appetite but thats all. I reccommend this medicine for people with ADD, ADHD, and Depression. It really improves the quality of your life. There isn't anything bad about this medicine. I hope it works for anyone who needs it.",9,30
Concerta,My son is in 4th grade and just started taking Concerta two days ago. So far so good! He is dealing with severe ADHD. He was a very angry child and since he started taking it the teachers have sent notes  home saying how well he is doing! School is easier so far which means a happier boy! He hugs me and kisses me and we have had less fights about getting homework done. We are very pleased!,0,113
Concerta,Worked for me the first year I took it but then it started to have really bad side effects. I have ADD but I don't have hyperactivity and I was getting socially awkward and having anxiety and even depression.  I don't recommend it for someone who's not hyperactive.,5,78
Concerta,This is a great medicine. The first 2 days I felt ill on it nausea mainly and I find sleeping incredibly difficult but don't mind so much as I don't feel bad for it the next day. It's also making me dream a lot but overall I feel great and have much more of a will power to do everything. I started on 18mg and on Friday I go up to 36mg so see how they go.,9,37
Concerta,"Amazing medicine. Helped with my recently diagnosed ADHD-PI (ADD). I am on 27mg and have no known side-effects. It has boosted my grades and my work is done quicker. It is the best thing that has happened to me. I haven't registered my ADD as a chronic illness, but know I will get it covered fully if I do.",10,42
Concerta,"I am on 27mg Concerta. Never felt better. I have better grades because of better concentration. No anxiety or suicidal thoughts. Guess I have too much to keep me alive, that I have never had those thoughts. Only side-effect seems to be slight insomnia, but I would prefer better grades over sleep.",10,57
Concerta,"I was put on Ritalin 10mg three times a day, then on Concerta 27mg. I didn't have any side-effects until I went to 36mg and I was only losing my appetite. I went back down and it still is really helping my concentration. I finish my work on time and am able to work to a higher level of work.",10,46
Concerta,"This has been life changing in a positive way, I never thought I had an issue and finally at 29 I mentioned it to my doctor who first prescribed Adderall I believe, I didn't like it. I mentioned it figuring I might as well give up, and then he suggested I try Concerta. Since that point my focus has gone up and I realize I did have an issue all these years! I don't take it Sundays to give my mind a break, only take it if you need it and don't abuse it.",10,54
Concerta,Only side effect is can't sleep and lost 4kg in 1 week,7,37
Concerta,"I was out on a couple of different types of medications for my ADD. When I came across Concerta, it is close to perfect to me. I don't get that feeling like I'm spaced out like Adderral.",2,42
Concerta,"Intensified anxiety, and taken with Abilify I did not know if I was hungry for a long time. My weight went up and down, and I stayed on the same dose for 9 years. It made no sense. In hindsight, the Abilify was merely treating symptoms caused by side effects of Concerta. I would encourage everyone who has been ignored when they asked mental health professionals for help, to also encourage careful review and make informed decisions about medications. Educate yourself!",0,46
Concerta,"If you have ADHD, pills like Strattera (non-stimulant) do not seem to work. You do need a stimulant. Concerta is amazing medication. I used to be on it from 2nd grade all the way until 9th. Looking back now, at 21 years old, I see that after I stopped it in high school, my grades dropped. Just started taking the average adult dose of 36mgs and it has really helped me in class, although there isn't an insane change. MAKE SURE TO TAKE IT WITH A DECENT MEAL OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER. If you don't, you'll find yourself with an upset stomach for a lot of the day.",8,98
Concerta,"Took 18mg Concerta for 5 days. On day two, I woke up and cleaned and tidied the whole house, my partner thought something was wrong with me! Then the side effects came... Nausea, depression, anxiety. By the time I was coming down at around 3pm I had to stay at home, I was unable to drive my car or even just go out. My doc wanted to try me on 5mg Ritalin 3x a day quick release but I refused. After reading the reviews on here about dexamphetamine I started them this morning. 5mg 3x a day. Hopefully this will be the one for me.",4,34
Concerta,"I've been taking Concerta for the past 14 years since it came out (24 now) and I don't plan on changing unless I'm forced. I've tried other medications and none work as well with as few side effects. Right now I take the 54mg. Sure I experience some side effects, but I've learned to manage them over the years (force myself to eat etc). The treatment of ADD/ADHD is only effective through a multifaceted approach, medication AND counseling/therapy/behavior coaching. Without Concerta I would never have made it through school or had successful relationships. ADD makes life hard, but with the right combination of treatments it is more than manageable.",10,218
Concerta,It makes me sweat a lot and have panic attacks.,1,37
Concerta,"Took it from 7-12 years old. When stopped, grades went down and gained weight. Taking it now again at 21. My gosh. First day back on it and wow.",9,66
Concerta,"It has literally made me who I am. If I didn't take it I wouldn't focus, I wouldn't pass school. It helps a lot.",10,83
Concerta,"I started Concerta when I was in 7th grade. I am now 14 and I started off with 36mg now I am 54mg at first I had a big boost in my grades! I started getting A's! This year I have been noticing in school that I have been more anxious, depressed, not hungry during the day, and a little bit socially awkward. I am trying to deal with my side effects. I am going to doctor soon about Concerta. You are not alone",5,92
Concerta,"I am 34 years old. I started with 27mg. Over several weeks I worked up to 36mg in morning, then 10mg in mid afternoon. My husband has seen an improvement in my mood. I feel less angry and better able to cope with daily life. I stay awake during the day now (I was very fatigued pre-Concerta and sleeping a lot). I am sleeping the best I ever have at night. My mind doesn't race as much as it used to. I still experience anxiety, but it hasn't increased since Concerta. I get more headaches and I seem to continuously suck and rub my tongue on the inside of my mouth. It annoys me and causes tongue ulcers, but I guess it is a small price to pay.",7,42
Concerta,"I was diagnosed with ADHD in 8th grade and put on 20mg of Concerta which has since risen to 54mg extended release in the day and 10mg immediate release in the evening for when I do my homework. At first the medicine was great- it allowed me to focus and my grades went up significantly. However over the past year or so I have been experiencing negative side effects such as depression, headaches, and loss of appetite. I can manage the headaches and appetite problems but as for the depression, it is so bad that I am considering switching to another brand or changing my dose because when I am on Concerta I become virtually emotionless, and as a result I am struggling to maintain good relationships with my friends and family members.",5,65
Concerta,"I've been on over half of the ADHD medications on the list, and all of them either made it worse, or added on to the tic the first medication gave me. I started taking Concerta about two years ago, and I remember improving in school greatly. It works fast, and helps a lot",10,62
Concerta,"I found this medication helped me the most through high school.  Right through my senior year I found I didn't need to even study my notes much because, when I took Concerta, I was so focused that I remembered everything said in class on my own.  The main downside taking this as a student is that it wears off by the time you get home, so doing homework seems impossible -- same with studying.  After I graduated high school though, I noticed Concerta started giving me symptoms of depression and worsening my anxiety to an awful point.  Ultimately my doctor cut me off Concerta due to those emotional side effects.",7,35
Concerta,"My experience with Concerta has been amazing. I am 12 and this has helped me deal with bullying, anger issues, and lack of focus. I have learned that just because you are ADHD does not mean you can't have a normal life. I recommend this to anybody who is ashamed by their weight, has trouble focusing, and has anxiety issues but make sure to eat regularly because Concerta makes it so you don't know if you are hungry or not.",10,74
Concerta,"I have been dealing with Attention Deficient Disorder ADD all of my life at 50 years old I was diagnosed with ADD, I had suspected it for some time, and began taking 28 mg of Concerta each day after approximately 2 months I went to a lower dose of 18 mg per day. It has had a positive effect that it is much easier to stay on task my ability to concentrate has been significantly increased.  In describing its effect it seems that my mind has slowed down. The side effects have been minimal a little lightheaded at times. I do not take it every day sometimes, I usually use it Monday to Friday.",9,60
Concerta,"My 4th grade son began taking Concerta 2 1/2 weeks ago. It has been the best decision I ever made. His teacher says he is a completely different child. His funny personality remains but he is on task, finishes all his homework in class, and actually tells other children to quite down. I lamented for many, many months about whether or not to have him begin a stimulant. It is obvious that it was the right decision. I make sure he eats a hearty breakfast. He knows he needs to push himself to eat something at lunch and drink plenty of fluids. He did tell me he felt prickles in his head for the first 2 days. His teacher reported he was a little tired for a couple days as well. He says his mind is more clear and not so jumbled. We're thrilled",10,143
Concerta,"My 13 year old son, and 9 year old daughter both have been diagnosed with ADHD. I, nor my husband could wrap our minds around our kids taking medicine, but were forced to give it a try. My son started taking Concerta when he was in 4th grade, and my daughter started taking Vyvanse in the 3rd grade.The results were amazing! Their handwriting went from sloppy to super neat, reading skills increased, grades were mostly A's...and many more great results! The bad part about the pills are that they have SO many side effects that were making them seem like totally different people! They were skinny, depressed, had Insomnia, headaches, twitching, and angry. We withdrew both from public school and started Homeschool. Now learning at our own pace!",6,69
Concerta,"IT MAKES ME DEPRESSED. Yes it helps me focus, and it helps me with my school work, but when I am on Concerta I am 100% emotionless and it is the worst feeling I have ever experienced. Constant depression until it wears off later in the night time.",2,59
Concerta,"My son started on Concerta about a year ago. It has transformed his life.  I don't like giving medicine but I have tried absolutely everything else - swimming, brain gymnastics etc.. nothing really helped.  He is naturally bright but just couldn't concentrate - particularly when it came to classroom work and focusing on a project involving writing.  The transformation has been incredible. He had an excellent school report in every area.  His teachers are thrilled, he is confident and happy and enjoys school. He doesn't take Concerta in the holidays or at weekends and manages fine going back on it on a Monday morning.  Only one side effect which is lack of appetite. We ensure he goes to school with a good breakfast and then he has a huge meal when he gets home.",9,104
Concerta,"I've been on Concerta since I was about 13 (I'm 22 now).  When I first started the medication I experienced a fair amount of weight loss. Overall, Concerta has truly changed my life and made me a more focused student.  Since I've been on it for so long, I have learned to manage side effects but some that have been ongoing are: upset stomach right after taking the medication (due to the stimulant effects and lack of food), slight headaches, jitters, binging when the medication wears off, and occasional paranoia.  When first beginning the medication, remember to force yourself to have some caloric in-take even if it is just a smoothie.  This has been life-changing, but please remember to balance out your diet.",8,70
Concerta,"My daughter was finally diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive-type at age 16 after a lot of stress regarding high school academics and feeling dumb.  Concerta has been nothing short of a miracle for her.  She finally ended up on the 54mg dosage and does very well.  The only side effect she has had is loss of appetite which she now knows to eat a healthy/big breakfast before her medication in the morning. She then eats a normal dinner. She has occasionally had insomnia if she takes her medication later in the morning or if she has accidentally had caffeine.  Overall, she is in a good groove with this medication and her SAT score went from 1600 to 2000 after medication and a prep course; GPA from 3.3 to 3.9.",9,77
Concerta,"I have 3 children, 2 of whom are on Concerta. We have tried many things prior to this and nothing has worked quite as well.",10,42
Concerta,"I'm a 15 year old girl who started off with Vyvanse for a year but became anorexic. I switched off to Concerta! The first couple of years I felt so amazing because I have never experienced what it felt like to succeed after trying so much. Then I got to High School. My meds ended a relationship. I was always paranoid and extremely nervous. I am like a robot now. I'm either extremely emotionless, really mad, or really paranoid. My friends tell me that it's like talking to a stranger. I get frustrated so easily and don't care about anyone or anything around me. I don't want to be taken off my meds because I'm really successful. But should I really have to choose between my loved ones and school. I shouldn't have to pick.",8,76
Concerta,"I would recommend this medication ONLY if you are 100% positive you need medication, by that I mean teachers and family recognizing the issue. My mom finally decided to give me concerta during early middle school after my teachers advised it for a few years. I recommend beginning with 9 mg and slowly going up if needed. This medication is horrible in my life in the sense that I feel like I need it to do good in school, especially now I'm in college. But it causes me to be incredibly depressed. I continue to take it because grades are first, but for kids I recommend keeping a very close eye on them and follow up on depression issues because as a kid in middle school, it was horrible.",3,68
Concerta,"My son was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 6. I was extremely against trying medications, but after an extremely difficult kindergarten and start of first grade, I decided that it was worth looking into. My son was miserable, and it broke my heart to see him coming home everyday in tears. We tried a variety of behavioral interventions, but nothing worked and my son was not happy. We decided, based on a friend's advice (her daughter had success with concerta) to give it a shot. OMG! It was like night and day! Slight decrease in appetite initially, but other than that, it's been a godsend. Wishing all you parents the same success we had!!!!",10,170
Concerta,"My current dosage to treat ADHD and depression is 37 mg slow release twice daily, morning and noon. Although the medicine does not completely relieve my ADD behavior (distraction, sillyness, loud speaking, impulsive acts, lack of sustained focus, poor listening skills) it does permit my mind to focus better and to self regulate my actions. I am also doing therapy and my wife spends a great deal of her considerable intelligence and thoughtfulness to improving my mental health and in consequence, our married life. The medication certainly helps to motivate for work, meeting and talking with people, and generally feeling a sense of my ability to function.",9,45
Concerta,I am 15 and have been on Concerta since 6th grade I have never really felt any side effects besides loss of appetite in the afternoon. But just last year I started getting muscle spasms and I began to zone out often at school. Even more recently I have began to have trouble with sleep and slight depression. I have tried getting the concerta switched for something else but its the only medicine that helps me focus in school and help me get good grades. I mean don't get me wrong it helps a lot but I'm not sure why I'm just getting these side effects,5,38
Concerta,took this halfway through 10th grade to through summer. First experience after being diagnosed with add so in attention without being hyper. No motavation from this almost made me feel worse with serve exaustion and depression I felt like every day was a chore and I wasn't as happy I used to be and my friends said I wasn't as free spirited or fun. Gave me social anxiety also and shaking. I would highy recommend adderall xr I switched to it and got none of the side effects but all of the results. I feel like I can function and am more social than even without medicine and I also can plan out my thoughts and lists of what I have to do and homework. Concerta sucks take adderall instead,1,32
Concerta,"My daughter was diagnosed with ADHD in the 2nd grade and her doctor and I discussed different medications and settled on Concerta. Grades were never a problem, but behavior and socialization were. She hated the medication and would spit it out or hide it. It gave her headaches, loss of appetite and sleep loss. Eventually she began taking it regularly and began to do well in school. The behavior problems ceased as well as socialization. She took this medication for about 2 years and then I decided to pull her off. Her teacher didn't even notice and thought she was still taking the medication because she was so well adjusted and presented no serious issues. She never took meds again and learned to cope. She has ADHD but manages it other ways.",7,71
Concerta,"Before Concerta I was labeled disruptive; unintelligent, impulsive, poor concentration etc. The worst part was that no matter how hard I tried I always messed up, and it was never on purpose. I am often described as having no-filter between my head and mouth. Now, with Concerta, I am able to 'filter' information correctly. I have control with what I say and I can concentrate when I need to. This is however, no miracle - I have bad days. Like anyone, my cognition suffers if I haven't had enough sleep, etc. Concerta only gives one control of their actions and organizes things in your head a bit better - something I had been long without. Please consider the facts provided by health professionals.",9,79
Concerta,My son who is now 7 was on Adderall XR for about 9 months. It made him more focused but aggressive and hard to get along with others. He's been on Concerta ER 18mg for almost 3 weeks at first he was complaining about headaches but his aggression has changed tremendously. He gets along well with his sisters and is able to control himself better. I think I'm going to like CONCERTA.,9,62
Concerta,I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2nd grade. I have been on medication ever since (I'm 31 now). I started Concerta in high school and I must say it did very well to get me through class in college. I was even in my majors honor society. Now I have to say I think the years of various medicines have caused some real adverse reactions. I'm very depressed and moody. I've gone from being the big go getter in my company to borderline at best. Worst of all I have a new son and my anxiety is really getting in the way of me enjoying him.,4,35
Concerta,I've taken Concerta on and off since I was 9 so 11 years now. I've taken every ADHD pill ever made and this one is by far the best out of them all. It has helped me a lot in life. I was able to focus in school and I always had good grades. If you miss a dose you can definitely feel it both mentally and physically.  I was able to graduate at the age of 16 and start working full time. I'm not sure where I would be In life without this truly amazing pill. I would recommend to anyone who would benefit from it.,10,67
Concerta,"I'm 19 and I've been on Concerta since age 7 . It has helped me no doubt. I have never had any problems as people say above stomach problems I have never had any. The only thing is I keep eating the complete opposite of everyone else. I usually take it at 9am everyday and I notice it wearing of around 6pm. Yesterday I didn't take because I tried something. I'm currently working night shift usually it's been out of my system hours before starting work. So tonight I took it 9pm even though now it's 4.30am and I've been awake since 7am yesterday I neither show or feel any signs of being tired, drained both physically or mentally. This medication has been nothing but a Success for me.",10,56
Concerta,"When I was about 13 the school psychologist who I was seeing for behavior problems suggested to my mother that I start taking Ritalin. I was hyperactive, could not focus, blurted things out, and was generally viewed as a weirdo by my peers. My mother refused to follow the psychologists advice because she didn't want me on medicines.  The same diagnosis and suggested treatment followed the next year and the year after by the Psychiatrist who I was referred to. Eventually I dropped out of school, somehow managed to get my GED and enroll in college. I decided a few years ago to see a doctor and he prescribed Concerta. I am now able to follow through on projects and not feel like a failure, frustrated all the time. It has really worked for me.",10,84
Concerta,"I'm 18 years old and have been on 18mg of Concerta for just under a year now. In the beginning I loved it - was able to focus and was very productive with everything. Positives: my grades and work ethic excelled, accomplished a lot, confidence raised. But, it may have just been me, but after being on Concerta I became very antisocial (the complete opposite of myself) and basically got lost in my head. I also suffer from depression and severe seasonal effective disorder and my first winter taking the Concerta was a horrible experience. The important thing to remember with this medicine is that it is not what is making you smarter or more accomplished, it is merely helping you to do these things without your ADHD holding you back.",8,68
Concerta,"Even though concerts has been helping me in school, I still get a lot of the side effects. The biggest one is that I am never hungry and now I am underweight. I still recommend you this medication because it has helped me improve my grades in school.",7,29
Concerta,"Concerta has made me more focused and things seem to be easier to understand for me. I am 36 years old and was diagnosed with ADHD. This is a wonderful medication and for me, life changing. I now know I needed this medication for many, many years now. And so far no side effects, sleep better and still have my appetite. I have more energy and I don't procrastinate anymore when I need to do something I just do it without procrastinating about it. Exercise is also easier, which is good because I am overweight and need to lose some weight. I seem to be able to interact with people a lot easier and now I can have a conversation with people without blurting out things before I forget what I want to say and having to pause in between sentences.",10,122
Concerta,"I am 18 years old. I took this medication for 2 years if I remember correctly, in elementary, yes it helped me focus better in school somewhat but at the same time it had taken my appetite away, gave me insomnia, stomach cramps, mood swings and hallucinations and if I skipped a dose, I would get physically sick. I would NOT recommend this mediation.",1,42
Concerta,"I was diagnosed with ADD 2 weeks ago, along with depression/anxiety at the age of 33.  My doctor wanted to treat the ADD first thinking the other issue would clear up so he started me on 18mg of Concerta.  The first week I would take one pill, and then this week increase it to 2 pills.  I haven't been on this medication like others have and I am experiencing so many side effects...i.e. nervousness, no appetite, headaches in the morning, cant sleep, paranoid for no reason.  I feel like its doing the opposite of what it should.  The first day I actually was able to just focus on one task and was able to get the laundry done.  I will be talking to my doctor about other medications.",5,30
Concerta,"I'm 18 years old, and have been taking Concerta now since my sophomore/junior year of high school. I was also taking Zoloft (for depression) along with my daily dosage of Concerta. Now that I'm in college, things have been going better for me, and I don't have to take the Zoloft anymore, and only take the Concerta when I feel like I really need to focus throughout the day. However, I've been noticing recently that while on the Concerta, I'm moody, tired, and unmotivated.  I also start thinking really negatively about myself, and find myself very irritable. I feel like I've taken several steps back, and should be taking the Zoloft in order to balance out my emotions.",5,25
Concerta,"I'm a 22 year old male and I've been on Concerta for a week now.  Like another person said below, so this is what it feels like to be normal.  It is such a relief to be able to access my brain when I want it.  I am able to put sentences together without struggling to get it out.  I'm able to motivate myself easily.  It almost feels like time moves slower, I don't feel rushed anymore.  People are able to talk to me without me interrupting to blurt out what I was thinking.  I can sit down and start something and continue to do it until it's done. I don't have the urge to jump up and do something else.  But I also feel really draggy when I get home and the meds start to wear off, it's actually very frustrating.",9,60
Concerta,"Flattening out the dosage peaks as these occurr with Ritalin is a pleasant experience, reducing fatigue and also the moments per day being confronted with a chronic condition. Most notable side effect was extreme agitation, forcing to quit the usage.",6,11
Concerta,"When I first took Concerta, I was more able to concentrate on hard tasks, such as writing and doing math calculations. When I stopped taking this medication, I was unable to pay attention in class, and kept misplacing flash drives and pencils. Plus, I've got a bunch of D's and F's on essay assignments because I've been leaving ADD untreated for six months.  Concerta helped me concentrate, but it didn't make me too jittery or not focused enough, and it feels just right. When I came back to the medication, after six months of not taking it, I've had the best school days I've ever had in my life. This medication works, no nonsense, just don't drink too much coffee or energy drinks if you don't want a fast or irregular heartbeat.",10,65
Concerta,"First couple of days it was working well then I started noticing mood swing, insomnia, anxiety, anger, agitation on top of that lack of energy and a sore throat. It's ok but not worth all these side effects.",3,32
Concerta,"I have mainly taken 36 mg doses of Concerta from middle school through 25 years old. I start the morning with 10 mg Ritalin then take Concerta 3-3.5 hrs later. Due to its appetite suppression, I come home weak from hunger after 9 hrs of work, but my mental focus keeps me going and I get irritable if something gets in my way. If I give in to my weakness, I will slump on the couch and think about all the things I need to do. I never fully rest mentally, though it alleviates some of the hyperactivity. I have severe ADHD that affects my friendships, marriage, and helpfulness. My aunt switched to Adderall from this because it helps you initiate tasks, which Concerta doesn't. I will try Vyvanse, which is extended release Adderall.",8,17
Concerta,"I am a pediatric nurse and a mother of a child with ADHD.  The nurse in me hated the thought of medicating my son with anything yet the mom in me knew something needed to be done. My son went on Concerta at age 6. He takes 36 mg and today is 12 and still on the same dosage. It has helped him in so many ways...grades, focusing, decrease aggressive behavior, and friendships just to name a few. Though I was resistant this was the best choice for my child. It's been 6 years and he is great. It does decrease his appetite during the day time but he does catch up in the evening with calories. I highly recommend a daily Carnation shake with whole milk or a multivitamin if your pediatrician agrees, to prevent missing any nutrients. Good luck to you all.",9,191
Concerta,"This was a miracle that at first changed my life. I went from being always late for work, nearly losing my job to super Mom! My brain was on 24/7 and never switched off. It helped me come out my shell and be more social, more verbal at work. Excelled at work, at home I sucked! I lacked emotional judgment, was very aggressive and easily ticked off. I became obsessive compulsive, I would lose my mind if anything was out of place. 3 years later I just stopped cold turkey as being a super mom was just not worth it any more. I quit my job and my family must just accept me for who I am. I lack focus and day dream and forget to sign kids home work, but I am me.",1,48
Concerta,"Okay I wanted to comment on this in case people are looking to put their kids on it, I am 18 years old, diagnosed with ADD in 4th grade, I didn't take my meds until 10th grade when I wasn't going to make it through high school. The first meds they put me on were 36mg Concerta, yes it worked and made me focus BUT! I have never been more ANGRY AND MAD AND DEPRESSED in my life, it was absolutely horrible. I am now on Vyvanse 50mg and graduated high school and got a 4.0 GPA in my first semester of college.",2,43
Concerta,"My son is 6 AND has been diagnosed with ADHD. Concerta is one of the medications we have tried. It does wonders for him during the day, he has GONE from being the class clown to top student. He always had it in him just lacked the ability to stay focused long enough to show it. However, during the evening is when we started noticing the difference it made in our child. He doesn't eat, he whispers even when everyone else was being loud, he became very emotional, and he would sit with a coloring books and color for hours... or sit at the computer playing games, he never slept . This was very unlike our son... he was usually climbing walls like spiderman... running around... jumping... happy go lucky! He became very withdrawn. We took him off it.",8,42
Concerta,"My daughter has A.D.D. so we tried Concerta. At first it was fine I thought there was hope for my daughter but after two months my daughter started to get angry and really bad mood swings Super emotional. She told me when shes at school she wanted to to scream and yell. She wanted to throw things. SHE didn't. MY daughter is very quiet and shy and keeps to her self, I am so happy I took her off of it.",1,36
Concerta,"I am 18 and I've been on Concerta for just over a year now, and I took an extra year of high school to catch up, I went from a 60 in math to a 90, I felt like I had a whole new brain. Like others, I was a funny, outgoing, active person but I now find myself completely content with being alone, infact I prefer it. I easily become irritated by spending time with others. I've also experienced uncontrollable mood swings, and I spend a lot of time crying. Lately, I've been losing focus though regardless and my dosage is already at 54mg. I'm so happy with my grades, and in the beginning I was myself, but in the past few months I've become a machine, and all I think about is how much work I need to do.",5,28
Concerta,"On it for 5 months now, and all I have to say is WOW. I have battled nervousness, anxiety and a very, very low stress threshold for all my life (I'm 32 now). It all changed when I started taking Concerta. Started with 16 mg., and felt a lot more relaxed, but also started to develop a foggy kind of feeling in my head. After 2 weeks the dose was upped to 36, and the foggy feeling subsided a bit. Then on 54mg. 2 weeks later, it was like I could see things more clearly. My memory improved, I'm 'sharper', actually feel smarter. All of my anxiety, nervousness etc. is gone. cons: had a persistent fungal infection for a while (on my foot) allergic reaction (redness), &amp; slight tinnitus, but all in all very, very satisfied. A life saver for me!",9,44
Concerta,"I have been taking Concerta for (ADHD) about 3 months now.  The effects have been both positive and negative.  I started off with 36 mg and my grades were increasing rapidly, and I was more focused, but I started to become more antisocial, angry, I didn't have an appetite, I had sleeping problems and depression.  Then about two weeks ago I switched to 54 mg due to lack of focus, and my stomach has been troubling me. I'm having twitching problems, and I am hearing voices.",7,22
Concerta,"I am a college student and I have to say this is by far the best ADHD medication I have taken. I was taking Adderall XR prior and was having major anxiety attacks/mood swings and just never really adjusted to it, so my doctor switched me to Concerta. It has helped me tremendously, I am finding it so much easier to focus and complete tasks, I have gone from C's to the deans list over the last year. I feel no side effects, I take the extended release medication early in the morning so it lasts all day but does not interfere with my sleep patterns. I would recommend this medication, it has worked wonders for me!",10,42
Concerta,My 10 year old Son got from Below Expected to Expected in Maths due to amazing Concerta. Although sometimes it makes him be a bit depressed and finds it hard to smile. But this has really improved his Grades. His Cousin also takes it and they all now are very good in school. Use Concerta! It actually works! Thanks Jassen-Cliag for this great Medication for my Son's ADHD.,10,17
Concerta,"My 9 yr old son started taking Concerta 3 weeks ago after years of struggling with ADHD. We've done therapy (CBT), educational assistance, behavioral plans. His issue is related to impulsive reactions, emotional liability - rather than hyperactivity - while he had always been able to do his work well and finish tasks - he was often tantrumy, would lash out at peers if he didn't get his way or become so overwhelmed emotionally that he would not be able to process the situation rationally.  ALL of the behavioral issues have ceased.",9,38
Concerta,"I've tried several of the common ADD medications, and Concerta works the best for me. I was on it for two years a few years ago. When I am on this, I produce better work in school and in my job. When I am not on it, my mind has significant difficulty compartmentalizing information, storing it and accessing it when I need it. Often I wouldn't even hear what was being said. This creates major anxiety when I can't think clear enough to get more challenging tasks done. What Concerta also does is makes me hyper- focus on small things like constructing a simple email to send to one person - it'll take me 15 minutes to write the 30 second email because I'm overly focused on my every word.",8,20
Concerta,"I am a nineteen year old woman taking Concerta for ADD. It really helps me. I can focus a lot better and I feel a lot more relaxed. My boyfriend and I went from fighting every single day to not fighting at all. It has absolutely worked wonders for me. The only side effects I have had is no appetite and I have lost six pounds in less than a week which I am not complaining about since I am five foot three and weighed 155 pounds beforehand. I have also experienced a terribly dry mouth but my doctor said it should go away when I start my second dose. Overall, I love it and I would recommend it to anyone!",9,23
Concerta,"After the first day of taking Concerta I feel like: Oh , this is how normal people feel like. The medicine did not get me hyper but instead it made me feel a lot more alive. Exactly fit my expectation. Thank you.",9,43
Concerta,"I'm 18 and I've been on Concerta for years. All the bad side effects I have so I tried other medications but nothing worked, so I went back to Concerta. I love it. It makes me focus and not annoy people but it makes me have mood swings and go into phases where I'll just not talk, not eat, just watch movies all day (not depression).",5,23
Concerta,"This is the only medication that has worked for me, with limited side effects. I love this and would highly recommend it if your insurance will cover it (though not all will).",10,16
Concerta,"I been on this ADHD medication, but never was on it for more then 3 months. I am always switched due to the weight lose. When I first took it I was about 135lbs, after 2 months I was 98lbs. I lost over 35 pounds. This was in 2010. I stopped taking it because it wasn't helping me. Within those months my doctor kept putting me on different medicines, none worked. I started school with no medicines, I was on the high honor all, my mom wanted me to take it because I couldn't focus I was so HYPER. So my doctor put me on Concerta again. I have been on and off, but I have been consistent for 1-2 weeks. I have noticed my face is very itchy and blotchy and I want to hide and cry. Well I'm getting good grades but lost 10lbs in a week.",6,13
Concerta,"My 7 year old was diagnosed with ADHD this past summer. My husband and I tried 6 months of alternative treatments (tutoring, organic foods, tonsillectomy for sleep apnea) but nothing was helping. Finally had a neurologist prescribe 27 mg of Concerta, and it is AMAZING. Her reading scores went from 50-60% to 95-100%. The same with math. She can tie her shoes for the first time and get dressed without an argument. I'm 38 and was also diagnosed (recommended by her Dr). Started the same dose and I have to admit, I feel calmer than ever, explains a lot about problems I've had in the past. It's worth a try....glad I finally gave it a chance.",0,37
Concerta,I have been taking this medicine for over 6 years now. I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of nine (now 24) and have taken numerous other ADHD meds. I feel out of all of them Concerta has been the most successful. I do however feel it makes me zone out and am quiet at times. Most think something is wrong with me but I feel it's the medication. I am typically chatty and friendly most times. It tends to happen when I'm one on one with people rather than a group setting.,8,22
Concerta,"I have been taking Concerta 54mg for 10 years now. In early 2002, I was put on Adderall 10mg. The first day of the 10mg, I came home from school and said, I'm never taking this again. Twice I tried to pick a fight with my classmates. Concerta was like a miracle. I could focus on my work (instead of splitting my attention between my work and drawings or books or video games), and I didn't feel any major side effects. A couple years after starting it, the difference, minor at first, was remarkable between the days I would and would not take it. I've had increasing depression for the past 5 years, though, and I'm wondering if it's because of the Concerta...",8,18
Concerta,"Some of these experiences are quite alarming! I never experienced the really harsh side effects such as depression, suicidal thoughts and any other bad side effects. I've been taking Concerta ever since I was 8. I was taken off of Concerta when I was 21 and I actually went down hill after that. I lost a lot of my friends and I can't control my thoughts, day dreams and mood swings and my performance at my job declined rapidly to the point where I almost lost it. I am 23 now and just got back on Concerta and am super happy with how it has organized my mind! .",10,46
Concerta,"I am taking 54mg for inattentive ADD its only been a month of taking Concerta without breaks, but I feel I have the general feeling down. I can focus with minimal distraction. After 3 weeks I am feeling the loss of appetite, lost 6lbs in one week and there is only a period of about 5 hours I can feel it work, during that time I love the motivation I get and am more social. All in all it does what it's supposed to but for only around 5-6 hours, after the working period I am easily aggravated and my ADD is worse than ever. My anxiety was high at first but after a month I feel like it is less of a problem for me.",7,20
Concerta,"I am taking this medicine for ADD. Very positive, this medication has changed my life. I am much more productive. Only side effects are loss of appetite and increased anxiety.",10,18
Concerta,"I am 15 years old and was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 6. I feel Concerta is like a mental steroid. I focus 50% more and understand the things I'm taught better. Honestly, I really do not like Concerta. I have muscle twitches, nervousness, agitation, a complete lose of appetite, (which gets to the point where I almost pass out due to suppressed hunger pains) tiredness, mellowness, confusion, mood swings quite frequently, irritation of the eyes which is one of the things I absolutely hate, and more. I am not autistic but sometimes I feel like I am during school. My social life is completely impaired. When I take Concerta I am a very dull person. I am constantly paranoid, always worried about what others think of me.",6,39
Concerta,"I'm 16, and have been taking Concerta for about a year now. It works well and really helps me focus, but I do have a lack of appetite and trouble sleeping. Neither of those are really bad though. My 2 biggest complaints are first that I feel less creative while I'm on it and second, when I don't take it now my concentration is horrible, and I get less done than before I started taking it.",8,13
Concerta,"Yes, this medicine does work very well for paying attention. It also can be used when you need it and can stop and start use (you can just take it on schooldays even just important school days if you want). It's good that you don't have to ruin your weekend with the bad side effects. If you just take one like I have for five years you'll focus but by noon you'll be a zombie that hates the sound of people trying to make pointless conversation.",8,15
Concerta,"I am a college student and found that for the first two months, Concerta worked wonders. It improved my mood, attention, and energy. It even helped with headaches. However, as I write this at 3 am, the side effect of sleep disruption has become unbearable. I either don't sleep for days or sleep for 20 hours a day for a week. Don't write it off, though. It is definitely effective and adjusting the dose may do the trick.",8,14
Concerta,I started to take Concerta in 2010. I see a difference about my school behavior. My teachers think that I have improved at school.,10,5
Concerta,"What would I give to not take medication! I am 18, and have been taking Concerta for 3 years now. It helps me to keep things in order, stop forgetting things, concentrate in class for long periods of time, do mundane tasks I hate. However, within the first week of taking it I will feel very moody, have tics, etc. I get excited and anxious easily. In the evenings, it is impossible to concentrate and it gets me often very frustrated or irritable. I have been considering changing medications or stopping because it suppresses my creativity and will have me concentrate on negative thoughts causing depression. However, the withdrawal effects will make me very lazy, depressed, or even manic.",5,10
Concerta,"I am 16 years old and I have ADHD.  I have been taking Concerta since grade 6 and now I'm in grade 11.  For almost 2 years I stopped taking it because I didn't like the way it makes me feel.  But just recently my mother wanted me to take it for school, so I did and I can concentrate and everything and I feel more aware of my work and I feel like I understand things better, yet here's the problem.  Whenever I take them I get very depressed, start thinking negatively, I never smile, never laugh and make jokes like I always do.  I've been trying to find answers why this is and I can't find any, so I came here to see if this was happening to anyone else.",0,22
Concerta,"ADHD makes life challenging enough, when the medicines that have worked for you for so many years are not longer available, the challenge grows. My doctor put me on this medicine and lowered the dose ...it's not working.",2,5
Concerta,"I took Concerta when I was in high school for 2 years. I am a very lively person; however, after the first year I literally lost all my social abilities. I had no desire to speak to anybody or go out and have fun I became IMMENSELY depressed almost even suicidal. Additionally, I became so anorexic that I almost got hospitalized for low hemoglobin.",1,18
Concerta,"Very stable medicine in the sense of little personality change and no physical side effects other than loss of appetite in the first week. I am 58 years and believe this medicine is the first ADD medication that I have noticed is truly effective.  It has helped my concentration and increased the length of time I work without any distractions.  As some others have commented, some passion has been removed as a trade-off in of efficiency in work and a greater degree of focus.  I think my sense of humor has somewhat diminished and everything is more important in some ways and seriousness has replaced my having fun nature.  I believe on the whole it has made a positive improvement in the way I function.",8,26
Concerta,"I can't say it's bad. I can Ace through an assignment on my dosage like an Ariel Atom. BUT there are some things I did experience, as I was taking it and in High School I noticed I didn't care to hang out with anyone. There was times when I did but I was terrified. The days I'd forget my dose I was buzzing with charisma. I'd have to say out of all these the creativity it sucks out of you scares me because I'm a musician. But the worst is the withdrawal effects, they hit you fast in the morning even before you take your dose( Headaches, can't wake up) and irritability. It gets the job done but there are too many side-effects.",5,22
Concerta,"My 9 year old was doing very well but then became overly aggressive. We are temporarily taking him off to evaluate. But he was doing better in school, sports and socially.",7,10
Concerta,"I'm 19 and I've been taking this medicine since 6th grade. It really helps now that I'm in College but there is one main thing I don't like about this medicine. It turns you into a zombie/robot effect. I'm a very sociable person but when I'm on this medicine I really become an anti-social person and sometimes I really get a cracked out sort of feeling. Overall this medicine does help, but it does have it's side effects.",8,17
Concerta,"My experience with Concerta was unbelievable. I started getting hostile with everyone, banging things, flipping things, over throwing things. I had to have the police and EMT come take me to the hospital.",1,19
Concerta,"I was put on Concerta when I was in grade 9 because I was struggling to pay attention in class and just didn't have any desire to be in school.  After starting to take it my marks in school jumped way up because I was able to now focus in school and be able to pay attention.  The only thing I find I don't like about it would be the side effects like the hot flashes, mood swings, and whenever I miss it I just feel weird and have hot flashes and headaches is another big thing I get really bad with this medicine.  But it has certainly helped me with schooling and just things in general. But it has certainly changed the ways of my everyday life.",9,14
Concerta,My 8 year old son has taken it for two months now. It has helped out a lot in school and with his social behavior. However he has gotten depressed and we have just taken him off it.,5,14
Concerta,"It helps me stay focused. All the other ADHD medicines they tried me on did not help, only made me have horrible mood swings.",9,6
Concerta,"I'm 24 yrs old. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. So far I've been on short-acting Ritalin, Adderall, Dexedrine and Vyvance. The whole works. Nothing ever worked well. I either had severe stomach aches and I would get so irritable it amazes me that my husband didn't divorce me so far. I've been on Concerta (36mg) for a short time and so far it has helped me a great deal. I can concentrate now and I'm not even near as irritable. Simple things wont set me off anymore. Finally for the first time in my life I can relax, being able to sit down without shaking and feeling really uncomfortable. I don't get the urge to constantly do something.",10,21
Concerta,"My 8 yr old daughter has been on Concerta for 2 yrs and it has work great for her. When she was 5 her teacher could not handle her, she was getting in trouble every day (literally). So I had her evaluated by her doctor and she was diagnosed with ADHD. After she got put on this medicine she started listening, sitting still, was able to comprehend information. She was just a new child and she was even able to get along with her siblings. Since then she has been a honor student straight A's. The only side effect we deal with is loss of weight due to lack of appetite. Mind you she's 8 and wears size 5T clothes so with this it was recommended she not take her pill on weekends, holidays and during summer break. This helps balance her weight.",0,18
Concerta,My daughter was diagnosed with ADHD in May 2009 on her 8th birthday.  She was put on Concerta and we immediately noticed a difference.  We have had to increase it a couple of times but there has never been a negative side effect. She even noticed the difference in her ability to focus at school and at home.  It has also helped her to maintain her friendships (she not as annoying). I am satisfied with how Concerta has helped my daughter.,10,26
Concerta,"My son has been on Concerta for about 4 years now. He started when he was 6 yrs and will be 11yrs in 2 weeks. He was put on this medicine starting with 18mg. Over time he was gradually put on higher dose as his age and weight increased. He is now on 54mg. Since my son has been on this medicine he has developed seizures because Concerta lowers the seizure threshold. He was diagnosed last year 2010. He has paranoia, fearfulness, psychosis, headaches, nervousness, aggression, mood swings, trouble going to sleep, and doesn't want to eat a lot. He has had suicidal thoughts and depression.",5,29
Concerta,"I am a 19 year old studying Chemical Engineering in college, and I would say that Concerta has helped me so much. I started taking this in 18mg doses in 3rd grade and I was then able make straight A's through 5th grade. I then began taking a higher dosage of 36mg in middle school and continued taking it until this day.  I graduated within the top 4% of my high school class and I am doing very well in college.  The single greatest thing about Concerta at 36mg dosage, is that I can study and stay focused up to 12 hours straight! I have become an extremely hard worker and other students, who don't have ADD, simply can't keep up with me because of the amount of time I am able to put into my studies.  I would highly recommend Concerta.",10,31
Concerta,My son is 13 yrs old and has been on Concerta for a couple of months for ADD.  He is doing great on it.  He is able to focus and his grades are back to A's and B's.  One thing I like about this medicine is that he is not losing weight on it.  He still has a great appetite.  The first two weeks his appetite was affected a little but now back to normal.  I would recommend this medication.  I even get positive feedback from his school.,10,19
Concerta,"I am 23 years old and have been on Concerta for over 2 years. I can tell you, as all of you have mentioned, that the first initial response my brain had to this medicine is efficiency. I went from not knowing if I could make it through school, to getting myself back into school after a year or so off. I went to college, and started taking Concerta. I had straight As for quite a while. I went from 18 mg, to 27 mg. I have noticed, within the past two years, that my brain has become very used to the drug. I have tried not taking it for a few days, because I don't want to depend on the medicine. However, I do notice after a couple days off of it, that my mind doesn't work at all. I feel like my brain is non-functioning; like I can't do anything.",6,27
Concerta,"My son was diagnosed with ADHD (predominantly inattentive) two years ago. I tried to all kinds of non-medication treatments: tutors, 504 Plan, psychotherapy, meditation, Omega-3, diet, patience, love, encouragement, bribery... everything I could think of, but his grades continued to decline.  He was finally prescribed 18mg of Concerta. By the end of the 1st week he was acing his tests and his teacher said she finally has a student to teach and not just a body. The change is amazing. Slight decrease in appetite and the first couple of days it affected his sleep. Other than that, no side-effects.",9,51
Concerta,The medicine is a life saver that increases ones quality of life immeasurably.,10,14
Concerta,"I was diagnosed with ADHD and I have been on several different medicines and all they did was make it worse and made me feel more angry and just want to stay by myself at all times. I hated everyone and everything. I couldn't go anywhere because I would get panic attacks. I couldn't complete tasks.  I was nothing but miserable. I was put on Concerta, and I am nothing but amazed how much different I feel and what I can do. I communicate with people, even people I pass in the stores. I complete every task I start. I enjoy being a mom, wife, and a grandmother. Most of all, I Love My Life! Thank You Concerta!",10,33
Concerta,"I have used a lot of different ADD/ADHD medications. Concerta works okay. It helps my concentration, organization, and memory only a very small amount. But it makes me very tired and moody. Overall, it's not worth it for me and I will be taking Adderall again next month.",5,11
Concerta,"25 year old, with major depression. Take with other medicines (Sertraline   trazodone) greatly helps interest which the others don't. Probably inattentive ADD- never got on in school. 18mg is good. 27mg is okay but I'm a bit paler and a bit edgier. Any more and I look and feel washed out and jumpy.",8,13
Concerta,"I am an 18 year old male. While I was in school I struggled with subjects that involve high levels of focus to succeed in e.g. Math, Chem, Physics, English (all of the important ones). In grade 12 I decided to try Concerta after a bad experience with Ritalin (night terrors). I only take it on days I will need it which I think makes you not need to go up in dosage. It worked so well it is hard to explain what happens exactly but it just makes you focus and understand what the teacher is talking about. My marks instantly went up. The only side affects I get is I feel warm and sometimes if I take it to late in the day I have trouble falling asleep. This medicine is a miracle, I wish I had it earlier on in school because it helps so much.",10,22
Concerta,"My son has ADD without the H. He started on 18mg in September. His teachers noticed the difference from the year before. He did lose his appetite, but due to a growth spurt and my making him eat he gained a pound. He loved the medicine and actually wanted to take it. He got the flu in early November and stopped the pills cause they seemed to make it worse. When we started again they still made him sick so we just took a break, thinking to get the idea out of his head, then I got his report card. He started the pills again 4 days ago and no sickness, as long as he eats 1/2 hour before. Teachers have already commented on the change.",8,12
Concerta,"Our 10 year old daughter has been taking Concerta for ADD for two months and the difference is unbelievable.  Her performance in school had been steadily declining from year to year without any explanation.  We knew she was capable of doing well so we found this very frustrating.  After asking the school for help she was evaluated and diagnosed with ADD (no hyperactivity).  She is on a 36mg dose after increasing it just one time.  After starting the medication we noticed a difference immediately, the first thing being her handwriting, it honestly looked like a different child%u2019s writing%u2026so neat I actually thought her older sister had written it.  We%u2019ve received glowing reports from her teachers and even from the principal and her grades have steadily increased to As &amp; Bs in just a short time.  Homework is no longer an issue either%u2026we used to spend long frustrating evenings on homework and now 9 nights out of 10 her homework is completely finished by the time we get home from work.  Thank you Concerta%u2026you gave us the daughter we knew we had.",8,22
Concerta,"I've been on Concerta for about 2 months now. While the effect is much more gradual compared to the hitting a brick wall at 100mph effect Aderall gave me, there were some negative aspects. The first week I was a little shaky, which I also had with the other medicines I've tried (Vyvanse, Aderall, Ritalin). First dose always seems to make me feel really depressed and sick, then the next day I feel much better after my dose. Unfortunately, after the first month of use I've built up a strong tolerance to it and it doesn't work for me anymore. Thinking about trying a higher dosage.",4,9
Concerta,"Better than Adderall for me. Adderall feels like a sledgehammer slamming my brain into focus and Concerta is like a master artist finessing my thoughts into focus as much as Adderall but so much more subtly. I will forget I am on Concerta (36 mg, may go up to 54mg), during the day. There is a noticeable tolerance that I have developed. 18mg used to pump me up, now I no longer feel 18. 36 is getting to that point with daily use. Only reason it doesn't get a 10. Take 6000mg of fish oil daily and increase your magnesium intake.",9,21
Concerta,"Concerta, despite having little to no side effects (for me), was not very effective in treating my ADHD symptoms even at very high doses (108mg).",6,5
Concerta,"Not a panacea, but big drop in concentration when dose is missed. Extended release, but loses effectiveness by early evening. Supplemented by low-dose methylphenidate before dinner if I need to work late. Taken too late, may affect sleep.",8,9
Concerta,"My 7 and 11 yr old children take 18mg and 36mg respectively. The 7 yr old also takes a 5mg Methalin tab at about 3PM because she melts into a screaming pile of shattered emotions otherwise.  Actually, that's how she was ALL THE TIME before she started taking Concerta. The 11 yr old recently increased his dose because he's getting older and bigger.  He was singing/humming/noise making in class again (which is what clued me in to a higher dose. He started taking Concerta because he couldn't access information when doing homework. The information was there, he just couldn't concentrate long enough to access what he needed. VERY frustrating for him. He isn't hyperactive like the other child, so he was diagnosed at a later age. Side effects: sleepless until 12AM.",10,38
Concerta,I'm 31 years old.  Getting diagnosed and treated for adult ADHD has had a profound effect on my life.  It's enabled me to excel at work and in my personal life.  I'm glad that people are becoming more aware of all of the possible treatments for ADHD.  I've tried a number of medicines and Concerta is definitely the best.  I would encourage anyone who is just trying any ADHD drug to give a little time.  Most minor side effects lessen after a couple months.,9,50
Concerta,"My son was diagnosed with ADHD in Jan 2010.  Went on Concerta, lowest dose and it worked wonders from the first day, even his teacher thought he was a different child. His problem was focus. He wouldn't finish assignments.  For the first month or so he has some of the side effects.",8,45
Concerta,"My son has ADHD (combined) and ODD. Unfortunately, the medication only help with his hyperactivity not his attention, plus he was still defiant.",5,15
Concerta,I do like this medicine. I've been taking it for 2 months now. 18mg it has worked very good for me but I have lost my appetite. I think it is worth it.,9,17
Concerta,"I actually have ADD. This medication gives me energy, helps me focus, and aids in retention of information. It is a vital part of my daily performance.",10,44
Concerta,"I've been taking Concerta for over 5 years now. At first it helped me focus and get my mind together. It also kick started a great social life and got me A's through High School. After the first year though I took a downturn. I became almost emotion less and robotic like, that eventful social life degraded, and I felt like a complete loser. It's a terrible feeling. After 3 years of use I worked to get my social life back and slowly found it once again. Even though I was lacking feelings I learned how I could access my emotions through certain mental triggers. Now five years later my social life is siralling once again and I'm still getting A's, but instead of feeling robotic like I now get intense rushes and euphorias followed by depression.",6,35
Concerta,"I never knew 54mg each morning could work wonders. No more struggling to pay attention during the day, impulsive outbursts, or late homework.",10,24
Concerta,Better than Ritalin.,10,7
Concerta,"I am a 20 year old female and have been taking Concerta on and off for five years. I was diagnosed with ADHD during my freshman year of high school. Concerta has worked wonders for me. I started high school getting Ds and Fs and left with As and Bs. I would stop taking it every so often after lowering my dosage to see if I could manage without it but I would almost immediately lose my organization and more importantly my motivation. I did experience some side effects, including appetite loss and insomnia. These were easily cured by a dose modification. I am now the proud manager of a successful business.",9,42
Concerta,"My son is 7 and was diagnosed a few months ago.  He started with the 27mg Concerta and that didn't seem to help at all.  Moved him to 36mg and he's doing a little better.  There are a few concerns though.  Around 5:30, 6;00 in the evening he will have emotional meltdowns.  Cries at the drop of a hat.  Also I pretty much have to bribe him to eat and he has lost so much weight.  I am thinking about trying to switch to something else but not sure what to switch him to.",6,20
Concerta,"I have been diagnosed with 4 separate and distinctly different forms of depression. In addition to my taking Wellbutrin, I am taking 68mg of Concerta daily.  I have had at least 5 other ADHD medications over the course of the past year. Concerta is definitely the best of all of them.   I have experienced little side effect to this medication.  My side effects come from the Wellbutrin.  Concerta should be considered for any one who suffers from ADHD or depression.  It is a great drug.",9,25
Concerta,"I am 36 and was diagnosed with ADD shortly after my youngest son was diagnosed with ADHD. I take 36mg Concerta and it has changed my life and saved my career. Looking back, I should have been diagnosed as a child, but my intellect got me through college, the military and life in general thus far. Had I been treated as a child, life would have been a lot easier. However, my struggles have made me who I am. I recently began a new position at work and it is extremely challenging. I need to be exceptionally focused and organized. I was drowning and getting depressed about my lack of success until I started taking the Concerta. 2 months later I have been promoted and able to handle a larger workload.....HOWEVER, my son developed severe tics.",8,105
Concerta,I've been using this for 5 weeks now. I was on 18mg for 4 weeks and just started 36mg. So far haven't really noticed much of a difference. I notice I was less fidgety in my lecture classes. (I'm 29 and in college) but my dose has been bumped up to 36mg so here's hoping.,7,9
Concerta,So far so good. I've been taking the medicine for about 2 weeks now and I definitely like it better than other medicines I've been on.,9,9
Concerta,"I originally started taking Methylin when I was 8. I was totally unfocused and acted so strange bouncing off the walls. My personality was a deterrent for any possible friends. The day after I began taking it, I walked in to the class, it felt like everything made sense. The board actually seemed entertaining, I didn't mind not having many friends. Still don't with a grand total of two to this day (I'm 13). After a while I realized that my vocabulary expanded at least three times as quickly as anyone else and that made me very unappealing. As I began to turn twelve the 10 ml dosage started to lose its effect on me. That's when my doctor changed me over to Concerta, they work longer and better!",0,24
Concerta,"I've used Concerta for 5 years and loved the improvements at first - I became successful, in perfect shape, and did most things extraordinarily well.  My life did a complete 180.  Once unfocused, unmotivated and disorganized, I transformed to near perfection in everything I did.  The price you pay for perfection - I've lost my friends and my social abilities.  I used to be fun and full of life!  You begin to seclude yourself because you are too focused, too mechanical.  You lose weight because your appetite goes away and you are indeed anorexic.  I couldn't sleep, had extreme anxiety, headaches, dry mouth, highs and lows....I can go on and on.  It changes you and you may think it's great but ultimately you lose yourself in the process.",1,198
Concerta,"I'm 56 years old, and I was diagnosed with moderate to severe ADD when I was in my 30s.  I took Ritalin, then I weaned myself off of it 15 years ago because I seemed to function okay with my engineering job.   Then, in June of 2009, corporate shut down the location where I worked and laid off nearly everyone, including me.  There were no jobs available, so I decided to go back to school and get a second degree.  This is where I discovered that I had nowhere near the focus that I needed to pull of 14 credits per semester. My doctor prescribed Concerta, which really helped a lot, as long as it was before 1:00 PM.  He recently upped the dosage to 54 mg. Now, I can even handle the late-night homework sessions.  It's been a lifesaver for me.",9,45
Concerta,"I dont know how I feel about it. I'm 21, I was diagnosed with adhd this summer.  My grades went from c's and b's to A's and deans list.  I can't say I hate it, But i can't say I love it either. I use to be this free spirt girl who was bubbly and loved to go out with my friends..  Although, I did have issues with controlling my impulsive mood swings, I still was really happy. Since taking it the past 7 months, my friends call me the cave dweller. It's sad because I'm actually content with being alone. It use to drive me nuts. I'm almost scared to talk to people i dont know My social life has gone in the dump. Nothing bothers me. It makes me get really good grades, but it takes away the passion. I feel like a computer.",5,236
Concerta,"I have been using Concerta for about 3 weeks now and it has changed my life drastically. I am a Film Writer and Director and can already tell a difference in the way I am filming, my co-workers as well can tell. It is awesome! The only side effect is that I am less hungry, which is okay in my book or in any other womans book. It is not a horrid loss of appetite but still, I have loss 5 lbs in 3 weeks. Which again is alright. ;D",9,17
Concerta,"I'm a 15 year old girl and have been taking 18 mg in the morning for 4 days now and 0.1mg of clonidine at night. I had a mild, lingering headache the first day, was able to focus a little more on songs I was working on the 2nd day, lost emotion and had to fake laughing and smiling with my friend the next day, and today I was able to focus a little more than usual and get some vocabulary words done. I'm more motivated, but my attention span isn't improved much. Also, I can sit still. My psychologist doesn't think I'm hyperactive but my usual constantly-moving legs and fidgety hands are still.  I'll have to give it more time to work, and increase the dosage once my body is used to it, but I think it's doing okay for only 4 days on a low dose.",6,15
Concerta,"My son had been on Strattera for about 2 months and, when we increased his dosage to 60 mg, he became angry, hostile and belligerent.  Immediately, I took him to the doctor and she switched him to Concerta.  He is 13 and about 100 lbs. and started on 18 mg 4 days ago.  The Strattera seems to have finally gotten out of his system and the Concerta seems to be working well.  So far there are no side effects, but I'm afraid to increase his dosage at the end of the two weeks to 36 mg. I'm anxious to see how he does in the next few weeks, but I appreciate hearing the positive results others have posted.  We've tried everything up to this point and I am hopeful.",0,27
Concerta,"For me, who is about to be 40 years old, I found that I had a shorter fuse than normal, couldn't finish anything, no energy, no focus. Went in to talk with a doctor and he tested me and found that I too was ADHD. I cannot tell you that I was shocked.  He said it was bad enough to warrant 36mg starting point.  I started it on a Thursday and by Sunday I had lost 6 lbs already.  Not that I didn't like losing that much but not the way it happened.  I have been so nauseated.  Now, days are not too bad but I feel like I am crashing at night and also very nauseated at night still. I cannot take this anymore. I will actually go back to the way I was, before I will keep up with this.  For my son at 81mg a day. It is absolutely FANTASTIC for him.",7,22
Concerta,"I'm quite depressed and bad at schoolwork. When I take Concerta especially high doses, I do much better at school and my depression goes away. It feels like I'm completely stoned and I have no emotions. I also lost 10 pounds in a month going from 105 to 95 it's kinda cool being this skinny, my friends think I'm anorexic but I'm just not hungry.",10,17
Concerta,"Very bad side effect: insomnia, depression, important weight lost...",5,17
Concerta,"This medication has made a huge improvement for my son. He is doing better in school and has NO SIDE EFFECTS, which is a major plus to me. No mood swings, fits of rage, or emotional melt downs. I would recommend trying this medication to anyone.",10,73
Concerta,"I've been taking Concerta for about 8 years and it's helped my mood and productivity a lot.  I used to get a stronger focus benefit from it and Ritalin, so there are times I still feel unfocused.  But overall, it works well.  The one-a-day dose is great.  It doesn't keep me awake too late at night, unless I take it after 11 a.m..  I definitely notice the days I don't take it, either by choice or if I forget to get the prescription renewed.  The first day off it isn't bad, but after that I get really cranky.  So I like myself a lot better on it than off!  My wife does too. It's not a miracle, but it definitely helps.",8,50
Concerta,"Made me very itchy and gave me liver dysfunction, doctor says it was a very rare side affect",1,25
Concerta,"I was diagnosed a few months ago (I'm 19) with ADD. The first--any only-- medicine I have tried thus far is Concerta (27 and 36mg). Not only has my ADD not gotten any better, but I feel I have anxiety, mood swings, restlessness, and insomnia. I've used it for several weeks, adjusted my dose, and minimized any external stress and it's not any better.",4,27
Concerta,"Started Concerta 5 weeks ago. Started with a pediatric dose (I'm almost 40) and worked up to 54mg. LOVE that I can finally focus and finish tasks, work is getting completed, my lists are getting checked off, and I'm making it to appointments on time. THEN...2 weeks ago, slight insomnia started to get worse, and minor anxiety..thought it was various life issues I was dealing with. Tonight..I'm dealing with severe insomnia and anxiety so bad I can barely sit and research my problem. I have a check up with my Dr in 2 weeks, I'm calling tomorrow to get in sooner. I'm very upset as it solved my ADD problems and thought I started a new life...I do not want to start the trial and error roller coaster all over.",5,67
Concerta,My dosage is 27 mg and I take it in the morning before I go to school. It tends to ware off by 12.,8,9
Concerta,"My son is 10 years old. I suspected he had ADD when he was 6 and the teacher kept telling me he was spacing out in school, but he is also so smart I decided maybe the work was just too easy and he was bored. In 4th I couldn't take the complaints (almost daily)and had him tested and he was diagnosed with ADD and given Concerta. I can only tell you that his math teacher sent me home a note on the day he started medication to ask where I got my new son from, she could not believe it. She said he even went in during his lunch break to catch up on some work. He lost his appetite for the first week or so, but regained it and hasn't had trouble sleeping at all. He is happier, his teachers are happier and I am HAPPIER! Thank You CONCERTA.",10,208
Concerta,"My son was prescribed the drug just before summer.  It worked great at the beginning but now since school has started the drug is not working.  He is very moody, impulsive, short tempered, sad and depressed.  This is not my son.  I also have a friend who's son is also on it and is doing great.  It maybe worth a try, just watch for the side effects.",6,18
Concerta,"Since I've been on Concerta I've lost 9 1/2 pounds within the three months. So far I've had to go to the hospital because it has caused me to have bad anxiety. Also I can't eat, I can't sleep. Although it makes me sick everyday and I have depression, my grades have gone up. So I guess it helps with something.",4,37
Concerta,As an adult with ADHD Concerta is the way to go. Focused and able to complete tasks. Although the lack of appetite and sleep come into play the time released 18mg work better for me then the 27mg...With 27 mgs I was tired and moody.,8,40
Concerta,My son is 8 and started taking this med 8 weeks ago. We took him off. He looked like he had black eyes from not sleeping and wouldn't eat.  He also developed tics and reported stomach and chest pain. He did okay on Ritalin. We switched him onto Concerta because of the once a day dose.,1,21
Concerta,"My daughter was put on Concerta when she was 6. After working with the medicines and getting the right dosages (it took about 8 months) starting at 18mg and ending at 54mg, it did wonders for her. She was actually tested for the gifted program in 1 grade (7 years old). She stayed on 54mg for well over a year. Little side effects. Sometimes disrespectful. No problem sleeping at bed time (9pm) for the most part. Until January 2009 she developed tics (verbal ). They took her off and put here on Strattera. (she could focus great, but it made her want to sleep). They are going to try her on Focalin. Despite what happened with the Concerta I would recommend it to anyone. I miss my daughter. I hope Focalin works.",0,28
Concerta,"This medication really, really helps me with everything.",8,13
Concerta,Wonderful medicine. I was failing school before I took it. After it was prescribed to me I was focused and graduated with a 3.7 GPA.,10,27
Concerta,This is the best medicine my son has ever been on. He has done great in school. A's and B's all year.,10,17
Concerta,"I've been on several medications for my ADHD and Concerta is by far the best I have tried. Ignoring the slight sleeping complications I have and the lessened need for food, this medication works well. I've found that while Concerta is in effect I'm less fidgety and anxious, and I can concentrate for longer periods of time. I really do prefer this medication over any of the others I have had.",7,48
Concerta,"My son is now 13, and has been using Concerta the past 2 years. Was working great, went from doing homework until 12-1:00 am to finished before I got home from work.  Concentrated more and was overall happier with himself and his achievements. Around November he had started having trouble sleeping and eating and was acting different. I guess since he turned 13 and puberty is starting to set in it wasn't working for him anymore so we are changing medications. I do recommend this medicine though, while it worked, it was great.",8,19
Concerta,"My son took 18mgs for 2 days and it was like there were five children wrapped up in him at one time.  He was nasty, negative, unhappy, and would not stop moving for 3 days after his second dose. We and the doctors were shocked at this reaction.",1,39
Concerta,Concerta has saved my life and I am doing great in school. I just got my progress report and I got a 3.8,10,24
Concerta,"I used concerta for my ADD and it worked pretty good.  It gave me a little boost and helped me concentrate better but it kind of just felt like I was on a controlled form of caffeine. The side effects were a lack of hunger, mood swings, and the crash was terrible. I felt tired and got in a terrible mood.  So it does help I'm not going to lie but I have since switched to another medicine because the side effects were too much for me.",7,64
Concerta,The only problem I have with it is lose of appetite.,7,14
Concerta,"I'm 17 and have been taking this for about a month now for ADHD. I started at small doses of Ritalin (10 mg) and then moved to 20 mg. My doctor thought it would be easier to just put me on Concerta since it's 18 mg a pill. I then took 36 mg of Concerta which didn't work out. I got major irritability and started feeling depressed. Even my focus was off. I went back down to 18 mg and it's working much better. No irritability, depression feeling. Make sure you're on the right dose for your body, too much can do more harm and too little may not do any thing.",8,75
Concerta,"I am 26 years old and having been using Concerta for approximately 9 months. I have been extremely impressed with my new ability to focus and attention to detail. I have always been a daydreamer and that paid off in creativity.  However, daydreaming during a meeting with the president of the company you work for doesn't pay off.  My wife, out of angst, suggested that I might have ADHD and should consider getting tested.  After a 5 hour psychological evaluation it was decidedly so.  Since I have started Concerta I have been promoted to the top position in my office.  It controls my anxiety and keeps me calm and focused.  The only side effects that I have noticed are weight loss (lost 30 lbs) due to loss of appetite and a lack of emotion.",9,101
Concerta,"This is it. You might have to up or decrease you mg according to how you feel at first. I take 3, 18mg tabs in morning. It is the Concerta ER, lasts from 8-12 hrs. No side effects at all for me. I am calmer, more focused, and still get a lot done during the day. I easily go to sleep now. Recommended for ADHD though, not for ADD symptoms. I am energized during the day and do not feel like I am coming off something. I highly recommend this.",9,96
Concerta,This drug works. I'm a senior at high school and ever since I was in Elementary School I have had grades ranging from D-F. All through school I had problems paying attention and in recent years (9th grade) I was put on concerta and I have had nothing but good grades and teachers were amazed at how good I'm doing now. THANKS CONCERTA.,10,83
Concerta,I just started taking Concerta again and I have noticed big differences in my attention span and being able to focus more. I was on it for quite some time when I was younger and then wanted to come off of it in the 10th grade. Now several years later I asked to go back on it and I noticed big changes in school and I thank God for this drug to help me get back to a somewhat normal state.,10,53
Concerta,"I am very happy with Concerta. I am 17 years old and started taking this about 3 months ago. Before I took this, I had a lot of trouble in school with paying attention and focusing, and after I took it, I noticed an immediate difference and it was so much easier to focus and pay attention. Another really positive feedback from Concerta is that it helps me engage in conversation more because I am more focused and I don't interrupt people like I used to. Also, it helps me think things through more.",9,123
Concerta,My son's attention span now exists.  He does not wander off into his fairy land every 2 minutes. His teacher and other educators are very impressed with his work now. My son complains of headaches probably because he has trouble falling asleep.,9,41
Concerta,"I had a great experience with this medication.  I had to go off all medication for a while but will ask for this again when I can resume. My doctor gave me Concerta and I didn't think it was doing anything.  I felt calmer, the way you feel after a well rested vacation, but that was all the difference I felt. THEN my co-workers started complimenting me on my work more, saying I was doing much better (They were the ones that suggested I get tested for ADHD).",10,73
Concerta,"I'm 20 i have been on concerta for 3 years.... before i was on everything else... every other medication was a emotional rollercoaster ride.... and i was  very angry before... now 5 years later.... i'm the happiest most confident person... graduated college with honors, and lead a out of trouble life!!! THANX CONCERTA",10,131
Concerta,"it's a lot more mild than Ritalin and more effective than Focalin. The only problem i have with it would be weight loss (i'm 5'2 and only 100 lbs) and sometimes i can't react as quickly as i would without the medication. weird, but an awesome drug for any adhd or add college student. It instantly gets rid of fidgeting and you'll be able to listen and focus to the most boring lecture imaginable (and learn from it!).",10,123
Concerta,"my son has been taking concerta at varying mg's for the past 6 years. He has experienced increased heart palpatations at night for the past year.  Cardiologist and ADD doctor state that its anxiety related. Rx has worked well for years. Unfortunately, i think its time to rethink the prescription as he enters his preteen years.",8,61
Concerta,My son was taking the 54mg for 8yrs when all of a sudden he started to get severely depressed and thoughts of hurting himself.  He was immediately taken off the Concerta. I had read about the side effects but it seem to be a small percentage of children getting this.   Make sure you read ALL side effects and the long term usage on how it will effect your child.,5,161
Concerta,"my daughter just started taking concerta for ADD about 3 weeks ago and she has made significant improvements. she is now able to stay on task and complete assignments, which she was having a hard time doing before. there has been no difference in her personality, which was a concern of mine. she also has developed a better sleeping pattern, whereas before she had tendency to have insomnia.",0,193
Strattera,"This Strattera is  the best ADHD medication I've had so far. It takes a LONG time to kick in. I was supposed to feel the full effects a month into taking it, but I didn't get them for maybe 2-3 months. However, it was worth it for me. Instead of just giving me energy and turning me into an emotionless robot like stimulants, it reworked my brain.  My whole brain functions better now. I don't procrastinate, and I can pay attention and work better. I have branched out into different hobbies because it gives you motivation. This is in effect 24/7 because it doesn't leave your system or wear off like stimulants. Now, the side effects. I still zone out and dissociate. There is a decrease in appetite (not as bad as the stimulant in that area, though). I have vivid dreams/nightmares. I feel tired often, and nap a lot. Also, I feel more depressed in general. None of these side effects are very severe, but they can be difficult at times. However, I really do recommend giving Strattera a good chance.",7,16
Strattera,Strattera has changed my life!,10,8
Strattera,Didn't feel anything but side effects,1,12
Strattera,I have Manic bipolar / anxiety/ VERY POOR FOCUS and I take this with Buspar 15mg . It was really good the first 2-4 weeks I could focus I had a burst of energy I felt so good I could feel it working I no longer had racing thoughts I was so much calmer. But after the 4 weeks my poor focus came back I am now on 60mg  once a day and still feel nothing Im extremely agitated and annoyed with everyone yet calm as hell still but waiting to blow if u get that. It definitely helps with impulsive behavior and calming the mind and feeling low but maybe its the combination of pills I take cause I swear I rarely feel low anymore never been better I just hate that It doesnt work as potently as in the beginning,6,6
Strattera,"Im 18 years old, suffering from chronic depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPDR) and ADD. I was really thankful when I finally found out, that I have ADD. It explained every aspect of my life that I, my friends and my family couldnt understand (you all know what Im talking about). So I started using Strattera. On 10 mg, I didnt feel anything.  On 25mg I started having some problems with insomnia and little bit of anxiety. On 40mg I finally got to know, what real anxiety is. Staying up till 3 am, sitting on my bed with racing thoughts, fast heart beat and high blood pressure. Being sure, that I have Schizophrenia and that Im going to loose control of my brain. Waking up a few times per night, sometimes with hypnagogic hallucinations and feeling like a total trash throughout the next day. Also wasnt feeling any relieve from ADD and my DPDR got significantly worse, cause of all the anxiety.. Cant blame the drug, every brain is different. I hope It will work for you. ;)",1,20
Strattera,"I have been taking strattera 40 mg for a couple months now and so far so good. The main thing that I have noticed is how much calmer and less restless I am. I am not as easily irritated, I've been sleeping better, I talk slower, I interrupt less, I fidget less. My cravings for salty, sugary, greasy foods has also decreased substantially, and I am more inclined to eat healthy and more nutritious or filling food. I have not noticed many effects on my attention span, so even though my body has slowed down my mind still feels like it is zooming right along. For this I have been re-prescribed a low dose of vyvanse at 10 mg to take every so often (I took 40mg vyvanse for a few years prior to starting strattera). I am also on 150 mg of Wellbutrin.",8,21
Strattera,"I have been on Stattera for about 6- 7 years now! I had developed a viral infection which developed disability in my legs, arms, and most of all my brain. It can have some bad side effects. The best I have experienced from this prescription is that's it's a very great pill ! It can help you focus more, relax, and controls up and down mood swings. When I need to focus or calm my anxiety down I can use this medication. I have been on this medication for about 8 years now and I'm 21 going on 22! A very great medication!",8,15
Strattera,"I am 55 years old and, I have been taking 40 mg of Strattera a day for 2 weeks now, but I haven't noticed any changes or that it has helped in any way. I took 20 mg of Concerta/Ritalin when I was younger, and it always helped me within an hour of dosing. I read that it may take longer like 3 to 6 weeks to help me with my ADHD. I am going to continue taking it for 6 weeks and see what happens. Does anyone else have any experience to share?",1,21
Strattera,"I've been on Strattera for two months now for ADHD. It took about 6 weeks for it to kick in and start working. I don't feel that it helps with all my ADHD problems, but it does help with a few. I've had terrible side effects, including loss of appetite (I've lost 10 pounds since starting the drug due to loss of appetite). I also get really bad hot flashes and any time I go into a moving vehicle I feel nauseous. I can't sleep at night and I can't stay awake in the day. The side effects are not worth the small benefit I get from this drug.",3,14
Strattera,"It does work. But, give it two or 3 weeks. You will feel weird in the beginning and a little nauseous. It goes away. I do feel like I concentrate better and focus longer. Be careful with caffeine! It makes caffeine much stronger and last longer. After a few months while on it I get very irritable and tense. I need a break and let it wash out. No problems stopping cold turkey. Take 80mg a day. Overall, its good. Not perfect tho. Orgasms seem delayed for some reason and slightly less of a sex drive. No changes in weight.",7,26
Strattera,"At 34 I started Ritalin.  It had up &amp; down effect. At 46, I began Staterra.  Hated it. Gained 35 lbs; anxiety soared; was fatigued &amp; lethargic.  My current dose is 60mg 2x/day. I never lost weight, but I feel normal.  I don't limit caffeine intake. I drink tea, no coffee. Anxiety &amp; depression are better w/Straterra. Just added 40 mg Adderall as menopause dulls the effect of Straterra.  It has caused high BP &amp; urinary retention. Yet I haven't stopped Straterra in 14 yrs as alternative is dysfunction  With my daily dose(120 mg)over the max, changing insur. &amp; MDs involves much hoop jumping. Cost of Straterra (&amp;generics) is very high. Some generics are not as effective.  Overall, give it time to become fully effective, carefully weigh pros and cons, don't expect to eliminate all ADD behaviors, set realistic behavioral goals, &amp; closely monitor self.  Med is NOT a panacea; it  is one tool on the journey to living as your authentic self.",9,18
Strattera,"I will admit there has been a huge improvement in my ADHD since I started taking this Rx. And since I already take a depression and anxiety med I don't have issues with those. No the problem is that it's killed my sex life. My girlfriend and I used to have a healthy sex life but since I started this med my libido has all but gone, strange things happen during intercourse, and I have painful orgasms. I can't decide if it's worth it yet but I'm leaning towards no",4,10
Strattera,"Im a 27 female, previously diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I currently take Lexapro 10mg once a day, which controls my anxiety and the majority of my depression. Though my depression still exists and I have an inability to concentrate and Im tired constantly. I started on Strattera 3 days ago, so I wanted to document my progress. On day 2 I started experiencing nausea and I took off work. My doctor suggested over the counter nausea medicine before medicines like Zofran, and its been helpful. Im supposed to be careful and monitor my anxiety so that it doesnt increase, but as of right now its under control. I lost sleep last night, but I took it in the morning instead, so well see how well I sleep tonight. Update you all in a week.",5,17
Strattera,"Started off on dose of 40mg Strattera, upped to 80mg after a month. Seemed pretty effective for the first few months, concentration was much improved. It is currently 18 months since I started and the effects have reduced to pretty much nothing and concentration levels are as low as they were previously. I also have serious sexual dysfunction as a side effect, including loss of libido, erectile problems and ejaculatory dysfunction. I wanted to go on Strattera to avoid the loss of appetite side effects of the stimulant medications but this also has some loss of appetite side effect. I hope to go back onto a stimulant medication soon after review from my psychiatrist.",2,6
Strattera,"Our daughter started taking this medication in October for ADD after failing school. After a month, we noticed a huge change in her ability to focus and obtain excellent grades. She was finishing her work in class and doing extremely well compared to before Strattera.  She just made honor roll and never fights or complains about school work anymore.  Our only concern, is that weve noticed our 11 yr old loosing weight. She is skin and bones and has dropped a clothing size. She says that food isnt good anymore and has to basically force feed herself. Im afraid we may have to stop the medication if this doesnt improve, which is unfortunate because it has so many great benefits and has changed our lives.",9,32
Strattera,"I was taking Concerta but had to go down from 54mg to 30mg because of side effects. With Concerta, I was saying everything that was on my mind and I still could not concentrate enough as my mind was all over the place. I read somewhere that combining Concerta with Stratterra has helped control more ADHD symptoms for some. Started 2 weeks ago on 18mg, and co-workers appreciate. It really gives me the couple of seconds to think about what I'm about to say, improved working memory, and I take it at night since it lasts almost 24 hours, when I wake up, it is easier and I get to work  ahead of time. Starting on 25mg today and if still good, will not try and up the antes. Too much meds gives you side effects. So my goal is to be just ok, good enough to be a functional human being. Will let you know how it goes . I started with Strattera, now on the generic Pro Doc. Will tell you if I see a difference.",10,21
Strattera,"Not a good experience. My doctor wanted to try a non stimulant option for my ADHD first because she was nervous about my anxiety getting worse. This drug was NOT the answer. Stopped eating and sleeping after about 2 weeks, until I had a meltdown and sobbed in my boyfriend's arms for hours. She switched me to a low dose stimulant option and I tolerated it much better. It might be a life saver for some but it was horrible for me.",1,9
Strattera,"This is my seventh time attempting the medication. I'm trying to do it right this time, no other choice. My experience has been to start at THE LOWEST DOSE... 10mg and stay on that for six to eight weeks before you increasing it. (10mg at a time) I usually expect and prepare for two weeks of awfulness in the way of side effects before things get better. I've learned to be VERY WARY of either nicotine or caffeine consumption with this medication. My experience with norepinephrine drugs like this is just a little bit of nicotine or caffeine sets off my anxiety and irritability. Helps me with psychosomatic pain along with cymbalta. Helps my anxiety. Increases alertness. Increases my focus but not nearly like amphetamine stimulants. Sexual side effects for me are not too serious. Orgasm as a male is irregular but I actually find it more pleasurable. I find it also useful not to combine much alcohol with the drug. Uppers with downers for me can be ugly.",6,14
Strattera,"Game changer for me. 60mg for ~3y.  Not magic bullet, but without it I couldn't be self employed. I still lose days immobilized or where all I can do is a few emails, but compared to weeks of incapacity without it. Eg without meds I can sit for hours thinking:  I need to do the dishes [add mental distraction here &amp; repeat] . Now I can go from thought to action; just get up and do the dishes!!  When I dont take it negative self-talk starts in my mind, from how frustrating it is to not ever shift from thought to action. I can really tell the difference Advice: 1) REALLY important, titrate dosage up SLOWLY eg a few weeks or a month 20mg, same 40mg etc reduce any side effects. Dont go too fast or start on full dose.  2) I can't take it til AFTER I eat enough and wait for my digestion to awake, or nausea. I cant just take it WITH food on an empty stomach or even just AFTER Breakfast.  So I eat oatmeal and take the pill later after midmorning snack.  Otherwise Id rate 10/10.",9,30
Strattera,"Im only giving Strattera 2 stars instead of 1 because it worked for focus, but the side effects were horrible. The first day taking it, I felt great. I had enough energy to get through the day and I felt present and in the moment. Then the next day I started to feel really strange. I couldnt sleep through the night. I was majorly wired. I started to not feel like myself. My head was completely empty. I felt like a zombie tbh. I didnt find things funny and I started to lash out at people which I never do. By like day four, I lashed out at my dad and then I broke down. I cried and was becoming really depressed. When I went off of it, my imagination returned. It was kind of a scarring experience.",2,16
Strattera,"Diagnosed age 46. Initially placed on med that works for son (methylphenidate - short acting 10mg) made me feel CRAZY - manic -like and my typical resting heart rate is 55 -on that it was 100, whoa uncomfortable. Psychiatrist switched me to Strattera 40mg x 1 mo. Side effects: sometimes morning nausea, intermittent dry mouth, mild constipation, took longer to orgasm, irritability. increased to 60mg x2 weeks then was supposed to go on 80mg. Insurance required a pre-auth so went off entirely for 1 month (gotta love US healthcare system!). Now last few days took 60mg a day  for 2 days then 80mg a day for 2 days. Side effects: EXTREME nausea 1 hour after taking but was taking on empty stomach so will change that, dry mouth 1-2 times a day. Resting heart  rate mid 60s. Havent tried sex yet, well see. I am certain I am more focused. So far am happy w this. Worry a little about possible liver failure but that is very rare. Probably more chance of ending up  in an accident from my inattention by NOT taking the pills.",6,14
Strattera,"This drug probably damaged my liver just in 4 days. I am 75kg I was using 40mg. I can feel tenderness-pain right upper abdominal that I never had before. I feel drowsy, depressed, confused. I would never recommend this drug. Especially to kids.",1,12
Strattera,"If you have interest in horrifying co-workers... This is the med for you. I took my 1st dose with a small meal at  breakfast, within 30min I began to feel queasy, but brushed it off and headed to work. Within the hour - right in the middle of a meeting, I started turning green... Finally, I jumped up, made a mad dash to the bathroom, only to projectile vomit in my hands, on myself, and barely missed a coworker.  I headed home, spent the next hour throwing up, slept another two &amp; woke up tired, but fine.",1,8
Strattera,"Ive been on Strattera for almost a year. I am a 23 year old female with ADHD. It took about two months to finally fully work, but when it did and I got over the side effects I loved it. You will experience some nausea and stomach pain in the beginning and sweating or feeling lightheaded if you dont take it easy. I recommend eating lightly with it and make sure you drink water so your stomach acid isnt going toe to toe with extended release. You may vomit if you dont take it with a little food. Give it time. I focus easily now and my life has drastically improved. Im getting my masters and work full time, and the medicine also regulates appetite and seems to raise the metabolism. Good luck!",8,45
Strattera,"This medication did not work at all for any ADHD symptoms.  The only benefit of this medication, when it was used in conjunction with a real ADHD stimulant medication, was that it helped control the anxiety and tics that came along with using a stimulant.  It only helped mildly, but it helped. No other benefits.  She had to be weened off the medication as it is more of a mild antidepressant/anti-anxiety medication than an ADHD medication.",0,5
Strattera,I give it a 7 out of 10,7,4
Strattera,"Background: I was diagnosed with ADHD in my 20s and was started out on strattera at 40mg now I'm at 80mg. Also take with food or you may feel nauseous. NOTE: THESE ARE MY OWN OBSERVATIONS, YOUR EXPERIENCE MAY VARY. Pros:  - It gives me an insane amount of energy and direction. Drives me off the bed/couch to more constructive outlets. - It makes me hyperfocused at 80mg and decently focus at 40mg.  - There is no crash like amphetamines. Cons: - Some mild sexual side effects that disappear over time. - Weight loss - lack of appetite (Pro if you struggle with your weight? - just make sure you eat!) - Zombie effect - I noticed some kind of dulling of my emotions. I.e my lows are not as low but my highs are not as high.  - Cottonmouth/dry throat. I'm constantly drinking water. - Possible sleep disruption if you take it late in the day.",10,33
Strattera,"Had a stroke, resulted in ADHD. Stratterra has given me my life back. More like the old me.",9,23
Strattera,I took Strattera along with other Bipolar meds. I started slowly losing weight. I'm already thin and didn't like losing weight. My hair became very thin and started breaking off. Then it started falling out. My anxiety was very high and I developed severe tremors in my legs when I walked. I didn't know it was the Strattera for a long time. I went to my primary care doctor and he said it could be the Strattera.  I immediately stopped taking it. Within 2 weeks all my symptoms went away. I still have very light tremors occasionally.  Be careful taking this medicine.,0,8
Strattera,"I have always struggled at school with attention, disruption, hyperactivity and just generally focused. Into my teens much the same but more intensive. In trouble with the law, kicked out of high school. My parents struggled to control my impulsive behavior. Fast forward 25years I was finally diagnosed with ADHD. Strattera 40mg was prescribed to me straight away along with an antidepressant. I was hoping to start stimulant medication but I was recommended this non stimulant. I am currently taking 100mg for a period of about 8 week's and have found it to help a little with focus but  has made me very impatient and irritable, mood swings. I find that my impulsive behavior is still there, I'm constantly looking to fill my day with some activity that gives me a rush of adrenaline or anxiety. I haven't tried stimulant medication so I'm curious as to the effects it might have on me. Overall I feel Strattera helps a little but I can't say definitively.",6,7
Strattera,"Was diagnosed with Aspergers after ADHD diagnosis.  I'm a grown female, having  experienced severe migraines at the back of my left skull 1st time taking the Strattera. Due to the colourings that are in these capsule, E numbers that cause AGGRESSION, anxiety and hyperactiveness. I felt suicidal over Christmas and no one would help. I was lucky I was used to adverse effects from all  ADHD meds , worst decision l ever done starting on ADHD meds a year ago, for studying and it has broken my mind I have anxiety, depression, a severe black cloud envelops me.  I force myself to wake up after taking sleeping pills, aware I must stop taking ANY and they did something to my emotions and I can't get better.  Don't let your provider give you a cheap generic. I was allergic to the  cheap fillers in generic ADHD meds,   having an anaphylaxis shock at work.  If you have anxiety, depression, on the autistic spectrum. Please, be careful",1,8
Strattera,"Strattera is one of the best things to ever happen to me. I had struggled so much with binge eating disorder, and (I think mild-moderate) ADHD, and with Strattera it was like a miracle. I can read things and feel/act on hunger. I chose Strattera over a stimulant because I have anxiety/depression, so it didnt help much with my skin picking impulses, but everything else has been great. I take 40mg daily, and after the first week of hot flashes and nausea, theres been no side effects :)",10,25
Strattera,"Been few months now and the only side-effects I've had are drowsiness (went away after the first few days) and one really awkward effect I noted is that my penis doesn't seem to want to work. It's as if stuck in cold mode and lost some sense to it (peeing is harder). Also blood pressure is higher, I can feel it, but I don't think it'll really affect me that much.",6,12
Strattera,"I started taking Strattera three weeks ago and it has been awful. I started taking this because I had too many negative side effects wit the stimulants. Strattera made gave me mood swings usually leaving me feeling depressed, anxious, annoyed, angry, etc. It also suppressed my appetite which kept me from eating. It made me feel lethargic during the day which kept me in bed and awake at night which caused severe depression. I noticed no improvement in my ADHD symptoms. I have stopped taking Strattera.",3,16
Strattera,I was on clonidine (non stimulant) at night for ADHD. I could not take stimulants anymore because I have a very overactive brain. Clonidine worked fine but I wanted to try out strattera. I am not sure why they say strattera is a non stimulant because it caused me to have such bad anxiety! It really has a stimulant effect to it. I felt like it was worse than actual stimulants!,1,8
Strattera,"Im a veteran and just got out of the military the past year, so Ive been having troubles focusing on school. So my civilian doctor Put me on Straterra 40mg right off the bat, and have been on it for at least 3 weeks now. The common side effects were nausea, cottonmouth, increased Resting/active heart rate, loss of weight, decreased appetite. However I do have less impulses and can focus more in school. But I sweat a shit ton after walking a couple flights of stairs or walking fast, and my heart rate goes from 70 to 122 every time. Recently had my first panic attack, so far Ive had 3 panic attacks since Ive been on this. Coming from the military I was able to do anything, and My first panic attack was me sitting in class just listening to the professor. For no reason it happened. Its not pleasant. I also feel my body temperature is a lot hotter now, and my kidney feels like its there is a ball there. Im also on 300mg of bupropion.",8,17
Strattera,"(female, 25 yrs old) It's hard for me to say if Strattera is the reason I feel calm and focused, because I am on a lot of other medications for other diagnoses (depression/bipolar, OCD, anxiety). However, since starting Strattera I HAVE noticed a difference, a subtle difference. I was previously on Vyvanse, which also made a subtle difference, but it caused too much anxiety. I noticed I've been interrupting others less and feeling more focused in conversations and at work. So I say give it a try, especially if stimulants give you anxiety.",9,15
Strattera,Ive been on very low dose 25 mg  Strattera for one month and havent noticed any results yet.  Im taking it for ADHD and depression.  My practitioner will increase to 50mg or higher after three months.  No major side effects except very dry sinuses.  I prefer Vyvance but had high blood pressure.  Im optimistic this will work.  I take Ondansetron for the nausea which works like a charm.,0,4
Strattera,"I remember my very first day on Strattera, I vomited. It made me nauseous for weeks.  If you are having side effects then I'd recommend taking this before going to sleep, you'll basically sleep through all the side effects. On strattera my memory has gotten better, I can focus more, I feel calmer when doing complicated tasks, I'm not so impulsive, and my appetite has reduced. It's not like the stimulants, it's more subtle and steady. I still have side effects, I get very tired, I'll get heart palpitations, and sometimes I get hot flashes. I now take this in the morning ALWAYS with food, otherwise I get nauseous. Strattera has helped but the stimulates made me focus 100x more, but unfortunately adderall gives me severe side effects (paranoia, depression) and ritalin didn't do anything. I also take pristiq for depression and anxiety. Please give Strattera a chance, like all medications they work differently on different people, so please don't dismiss this because others might not have liked it.",7,27
Strattera,Medication is soo suboptimal works for a week or two then gets less and less effective everyday,2,9
Strattera,"I was put on 40mg of Strattera right after being diagnosed with ADHD. The first couple days, I had a lot of nausea, dry mouth, and fatigue, but I knew to expect this, and tried to power through.  After a week, however, I started feeling super irritable, which is not normal for me. I'm typically an even-keeled, patient person most of the time. Then, last night, I started uncontrollably crying and thinking terrible, awful things about myself that I have never thought before. . My partner said, That's the worst I've ever seen you.  I didn't take it today (I refuse to take that ever again) and after a week on it, I feel lifeless. Like a zombie. Like my personality, my thought life, my ability to function is just not there. I assume this will get better after a bit more time, but it's scary to think that all that can change in one week.",2,18
Strattera,"Kept me from sleeping deeply enough to be restorative, ended up getting severely ill due to lack of rest.",2,9
Strattera,"I want to start out by saying that I have nothing against this medication. Some people thrive on it, and I wish I was one of them. However, it does not seem to be for me.  I have been on this medication for 3 months, and I have not really experienced what I wanted to on it.  I take 40 mg a day, early morning, for ADHD, and thought it would help me focus, and be more productive. Instead, it seems to have just made me lethargic and exhausted most of the day. sometimes just wanting to sleep, instead of anything else.  I do feel a little more focused in general, but not in the areas I need to be, like during work.  I also started sweating... a LOT! I sweat buckets while on this medication, and I constantly feel hot, even when nobody else does. It can be rather debilitating. I already take a diuretic, so I am sure that this is not beneficial for me at all.  My mind does seem calmer, but I don't know if it is worth it for me if these are the side effects.",5,23
Strattera,"Just started my second week on Strattera increased the dose as per my Psychiatrists instructions to 50 mg's. I have not noticed any side effects or any gains, which is to be expected, and will be increasing the dose to 75 mg's next week before a psychiatric review a week after that. Will keep you all updated on my journey. My son who has also been diagnosed with ADHD is on 30 mg's of Ritalin. Please remember with these reviews that we all different which is why there are a number of ADHD treatments. What works for me may not work for you.",0,14
Strattera,"Do not let negative online reviews and personal anecdotes prevent you from trying Strattera if suggested by your doctor! Side effects: at first, I had some nausea, alleviated by taking after food. Now, after seven weeks, I take it at bedtime and have no side effects. I can already notice a real difference! I tried Strattera last year but only took it sporadically for a few weeks, not giving it a chance to build up to a steady state and take effect. This time, I have not missed a dose, and I am now at the full dosage for me (100mg). In the past, I was prescribed Adderall. I was concerned that Strattera would not work for me, because I had already experienced the rush of the onset of a stimulant medication. Adderall also affected my emotions/behavior in negative ways. Strattera is an entirely different experience. Even when I do not notice its benefits in the moment, I can look back at my day or week and see the difference in my attention/focus.",8,65
Strattera,"Took 60mg strattera as prescribed for 4 months. Stomach pains &amp; headaches we're endless. There was zero improvement for ADHD. This RX did cause frequent dreaming during sleep, to which I can say was it's only benefit to me.",3,5
Strattera,"Strattera wonderful alternative to stimulants. While unmedicated, I would consistently have brain fog and I would never be able to focus. I would frequently have to ask others to repeat themselves as I would always drift off mid sentence. I never experienced hyperactivity. Every stimulant medication I tried (Adderall, IR Ritalin, concerta) all resulted in anxiety, and loss of personality. With strattera I feel as if the fog has cleared, while also maintaining my regular self- the most  normal  Ive ever felt. Im currently on 80 mg a day weighing 175 lbs. It took my body roughly 5 weeks to become fully adjusted to the medication and receive the full benefits. Just make sure to always take this medication on a full stomach or youll probably experience some nausea. Also, the first couple weeks I felt a little more agitated than usual, but this passed after the first few weeks. Give this medication a chance, especially if stimulants give you anxiety!",10,50
Strattera,"After no luck with stimulants, my psych prescribed Strattera. Started at 40mg for a week then moved up to 80mg. I didn't have any side effects at 40mg but 80 mg was awful. First was the unbearable nausea. I started feeling sick an hour or so after my dose and vomited about 1/3 of the time. I was finally able to combat the nausea with high protein, high carb, low sugar breakfasts. About a month in, I realized that I had literally no desire to leave the house. At about 7-8 weeks, it finally kicked in full-force, coinciding with my husband being out of town for work. I found myself irritable, sad, and lethargic. He was having a good time on his trip and it just made me more and more upset. I struggled to not lash out. I felt like a moody teenager again. I did have moments where I felt more together - I feel like I was able to do a better job making myself stay on task when I started to get distracted. But that tiny improvement wasn't worth the emotional and physical side effects.",2,12
Strattera,"My boyfriend has been on and off this medication for the last 10 months. He gets crazy anxiety when he's been taking it consistently for over two weeks, and has really bad tummy aches.

Strattera,This medication had my son  hallucinating  After about 3 months on it.  The doctor took him off of ASAP,0,9
Strattera,"I tried it for a second time out of desperation because they dont want to give me adderal. This medication mellows me out so much I just want to stay in bed all the time. So not worth the nausea. I can read again which is a plus, but just not worth it. It gives icky feeling doesnt go away.  Feels like pregnancy morning sickness I had to buy a pregnancy test just to be sure. Just say no to this drug.",1,16
Strattera,"I went on 40mg of Strattera about three months after my psychiatrist left the office. I had been on 40mg of Adderall for two years under his care. After meeting with my new   Nurse Practitioner , I was told that no more scripts for Adderall would be written unless you were tested for ADD. My son had been diagnosed with disorder since he was five. I scheduled the exam and in the process of jumping thru the many hoops required to get my meds back. The Strattera was working fairly well. I did find myself sleeping a lot more during the day, but about six weeks into the regimen, my hair started falling out in clumps. I went and had my thyroid checked but it was normal. And as the weeks went by, the hair loss became more and more prevalent. Finally after three months into my dosage after racking my brain to see what I had done differently or changed up in my routine and I realized it was the Strattera. Meanwhile I have a balding spot in my crown and I am confused as to what to do...",6,14
Strattera,"I was finally diagnosed 3 years ago at the age of 45.  After trying stimulants and stopping them due to the side effects, being agitation, sleeplessness, crashes, chest pains on heart side, etc..., I was then prescribed Straterra.  Unfortunately, Straterra's side effects were absolutely horrible.  I was advised that the side effects would subside after 3 to 4 weeks.  Well after 3 to 4 weeks, those horrible the side effects did suddenly stop, but then I had unbearable anxiety.  Next I'll be trying Wellburtrin or Effexor, the next line medication that may help with my ADHD, although probably not as effective as the medications mentioned above.  Very frustrating, but not giving up.  I keep praying for some relief :)",2,11
Strattera,Switched from Adderall to Strattera for my grandson.  The change is amazing without the weight loss side effects.  So happy with the change.,9,10
Strattera,"I have been on strattera for four months for ADHD. I also have anxiety. Strattera took a few weeks to see the effects, but my focus has increased and my hyperactivity has gone down. It can make your ear ring, raise your blood pressure, and your heart rate for a while, but I have found this is less apparent with a meal. In the beginning it made me very nauseous and there was vomiting, but not if you eat with a meal. I take it in the morning. I feel that if you wait, you will eventually become accustomed to the dosage and see results similar to Vyvanse. I take 40mg a day.",8,13
Strattera,"I started with 40mg of Strattera and worked my way up to 80mg. The only side effects I've experienced are some mild queasiness and drowsiness, and once my body got used to the medication those side effects went away! I've noticed significant mood improvement with the combination of this drug and diet/ exercise. Planning for the future is noticeably less stressful and I even found it easier to do simple things like grocery shopping and coming into work early. Im still not perfect, because I have still missed a dentists appointment. Ive also noticed less cognitive distortions, which makes things more comfortable. I will say that it still doesnt help with the immediate distractions or impulses, like stimulants do. It takes some time for it to work, you have to take it every day, and you still need to live a healthy life. So even if it helps a little its not some miracle drug. Manage your expectations if youre considering asking your doctor about it.",8,26
Strattera,"2 weeks in and I am still waiting. All I do is keep failing asleep everywhere, no other side effects. Came off of Lisdexamphetamine 2 weeks ago which was real good but side effects were bad heartburn and dry mouth and feeling exhausted every day, but it worked very well otherwise. But needed to slow down to switched to Atomoxetine, now waiting for the results... Not sure when or how I will feel..... Neil",4,5
Strattera,I've been on 25mg Strattera for around 10 days and it is starting to feel like an on switch hit my brain. I can almost write computer programming code again with ease after I was practically crippled.,8,34
Strattera,"Was prescribed 40mg Strattera off the bat. Had every side effects within 30 minutes of taking the pill. I vomited, got hot flashes then goosebumps, drowsy and sleepy. I felt like I didnt want to go anywhere. Tried again the next day with food and couldnt hold it down after 2 hours. Again same side effects. People are like  give the medication a chance to work .  Screw that - I've never experienced more terrible side effects in my life even though I just started.  Only positive is my anxiety went away but I didnt feel like going anywhere. Never again",0,22
Strattera,Hi all diagnosed with ADHD after researching after a diagnosis been a roller coaster for me. We went to Ritalin first didn't make any changes then doctor put me on Concerta same as Ritalin no real positive response so he has just started me on Strattera 60mg for the first week then up to 120mg  I haven't experienced any negative effects apart from slight nausea but usually settle down quickly. I know it's different for everyone but I can honestly say that even after a week I have noticed a difference have now been on 120mg for 3 days and things are going great - less distracting thoughts able to get work done and invoices sent out looking forward to what the next few weeks,8,15
Strattera,TERRIBLE medicine. Do yourself a favor and dont take it because the side effects are terribly embarrassing. Stopped taking it months ago and take all-natural remedies instead.,1,12
Strattera,"I took Strattera for 3 months for ADHD. I started on 30mg, and had severe side effects such as headache, fatigue, nausea, muscle aches and a high heart rate. These side effects were not able to be relieved with painkillers, eating or drinking. Then my dosage was increased to 40mg. I was now experiencing insomnia, an extreme heart rate and would often nearly faint when I stand up for too long or too quickly. I also started to experience depression and suicidal thoughts. I had my dosage decreased to 10mg but the side effects persisted, only to a lesser extent. Whenever I come off the drug, I immediately feel better. To anyone reading; I spent 3 months well aware of the side effects and common negative reaction because I desperately wanted it to work and to be one of the few that seem to get positive effects, but this did not work out and it caused a lot of unnecessary grief in my life in the past few months. Take care and caution.",2,24
Strattera,"This did not work at all. I figured I would try the non-stimulant route, but it turned out to be useless and a waste of time. I have had much better luck with Vyvanse and have been on it for many years.",1,15
Strattera,"I've been taking it for 8 days (it's not a long time and it does take a while to actually get into effect) but so far I've noticed that my mood has been slightly lower than normal and I get angry easier. I also have been getting sensory overload but I'm just gonna put that on the fact that I'm no longer on anxiety meds. This medicine takes 4-6 weeks to fully go into effect and I will be waiting till then to see how it goes. Medicine works differently on everyone, so while some people think it's awful, others may think it's the best thing that's ever happened to them. If your doctor prescribes it, I suggest taking it and waiting till the 4-6 week mark unless it makes you physically ill, and even then I would give it a week or two to see if it goes away. This kind of thing is normally hit or miss and you might have to go through a few meds before you find one that is right for you. It has a lot of negative reviews but the review that are good are saying that it's amazing and you could be that person.",6,29
Strattera,"This drug ruined my life. I took it for five months total. I was only on 25mg and it was giving me heart palps and panic attacks. If I had anything with caffeine I thought I would die. When I stopped taking this med everything spiralled down. I had terrible anxiety, couldn't sleep, couldn't think straight and had dry mouth for months. This slowly improved over two and a half years until I felt normal again. But now after being on other meds like Cipro my symptoms came back and I have to start over. I'm sensitive to any mood altering substance land probably will be for the rest of my life! I used to have goals but now I struggle to survive. I have a friend who came off it fine but in my opinion it's not worth it. Other people I've talked to have had similar reactions. I hope I can do good by offering this advice: don't take strattera to manage ADHD even though it seems safe. I live with pain and regret every day and would give anything to go back and change my mind about taking strattera.",1,22
Strattera,"Ive been taking Strattera for a month. After being on it for two weeks, out of the blue, I had an angry outburst; a fit of rage directed at my husband for something small. It was completely out of character for me. Since then I have felt negative, angry, and irritable most days. Also after taking it for two weeks, I started getting a horrible, bitter taste in my mouth about twice a day with an acidic feeling in my stomach (not associated with any food or drink). And I have extreme dry mouth. I had dry mouth while taking Adderall, too, but the dry mouth Im experiencing on Strattera is off the charts! And it has done something weird with my focus. Ill be focused on one thing that I want to accomplish, then I get easily distracted by something else and I hyper-focus on that to the extent that I cant stop what Im doing (like obsessive compulsive) and everything and everyone around me suffers. My last dose was yesterday. My doctor is switching me back to Adderall.",2,12
Strattera,"I have been taking Strattera (50mg) for just under three weeks. I have noticed subtle improvements in focusing and organizing thoughts. The overlapping things to remember in my mind have quieted down. I hope to increase to 80mg at my four week mark.   These are the side effects I'm experiencing: daily sleepiness, dry mouth (nothing major), runny nose/clear sinuses and insomnia (until I moved my second dosage to 3 p.m. from 7 p.m.). I really hope the fatigue clears up after a month. That is my biggest concern at the moment.   I do not have the appetite suppression, nausea, vomiting or dizziness that some people have. Also, I take it on an empty stomach.    Overall, I'm pleased, but still in the early stages. I would recommend trying Strattera. The generic cost me less than $10 for 30 days.",5,18
Strattera,"Started taking this medication and was bummed out about it not working for a month, and then all of a sudden, week five and I can feel a difference. It's a much cleaner energy to me than adderrall, with adderrall I can't sleep at night, I grit my teeth, and am almost manic. Strattera is the complete opposite, I can read a book, work on homework and such. Definitely worth the wait.....and no come downs, steady medicine.",8,34
Strattera,Adult ADHD diagnosed with the onset of depression at age of 32.  I was on 60 mg of Adderall but doctors will not prescribe controlled substance anymore due to liability of my insurance through Medi-Cal right now. Strattera has done absolutely nothing for me. I started off with the dosage of 40 mg and went up to 80 mg. Makes me tired and nothing else. Pointless to even take just like Ritalin was.,1,6
Strattera,"I have felt horrible for weeks, feeling like I'm in the early stages of a disease or disorder. Headaches, joint pain, nausea, constipation, stomach cramps, insomnia, dry mouth, feeling irritated, tired, I've even had eye twitching problems which I've never had in my life. I get flushed or sweaty. Iv'e woke up with horrible leg cramps and toes even feel weird. Never want to take this again.",2,18
Strattera,I took it only for a few days. It caused me to have severe rage attacks. I didn't continue taking it. (I do not have anger problems normally). Also gave me hot flashes. I went back to adderall which does not cause me any issues.,1,11
Strattera,"I have taken this meds over 5 month (10 mg a day)  now. It definitely improved as far as concentration, cleared cluttered thought in my head. Now I have no anxiety while I drive because I can focus better. This meds takes time to effect on you and it works if you give it a time.  Everybody is different but this meds worked for me without side effect.  Be patient with this meds and it will work wonder!",9,32
Strattera,"My son took Strattera for 3 months to treat ADHD.  He had slight depression when he started it and the doctor said Strattera would help with that.  After no improvement in 1 month, his dosage was doubled. Within a few weeks he began self harming.  We thought it was the depression, but looking back it linked  to the increase of Strattera. This drug and the side effects sent him on a spiral of medication and hospitalizations and could have cost him his life.  Stay away!!   Read the side effects. Watch for any signs of behavior change and do not take them lightly.  This is dangerous!",1,16
Strattera,"This med has been the best thing to happen to me. I do feel nausea for a bit after taking it but I started on 40mg dose literally felt amazing after first week . As for a lot of you saying your having horrible effects, there are misdiagnosis all the time and depending on what other meds your taking will change how each person is affected by the med, and everyones body's are different so might suit different meds",9,41
Strattera,"My son was switched to this after an increase in a different med didn't work but the lower dose was not enough. This medication did the absolute opposite. He was sent home from school early day 2,3,and 4 on this medication. An hour after giving the medication he was a different child .. even more impulsive and hyperactive. I kept saying to myself he needs time for it to get in a system.... it needs to build up in his system. After dealing with these awful behaviors and him being sent home I finally called the pharmacist because his doctor was not open being a weekend. the pharmacist agreed that it was a failure to treat with this medication.",1,10
Strattera,"Does nothing.  No side effects, no effects at all to be honest.",3,7
Strattera,"Before I start, I would like to point out that while I have never taken Strattera, my brother has, and it has completely changed who he is as a person. He was diagnosed with ADHD when he was six-- we were so lucky it was caught that early-- and, after a few fluctuations in dosage, ended up on 35mg a day. I can't even explain how much of a difference I noticed in him-- he went from constantly hyper, selfish, and distracted (I understand that those were not his fault, though) to a focused individual with passions. Strattera did stunt his growth-- he's been taking it for seven years now, and at age 13 is 46 and 70 pounds-- but I think he would agree with me when I say it is so worth it; he often comments how glad he is to have it. Even after seven years it continues to work well.",10,36
Strattera,"Felt depressed, tight chest symptoms, and nauseas. Did not focus any better.",1,6
Strattera,"I was diagnosed with ADD as an adult in my 30's, I'm now 51. I was prescribed Adderall after my diagnosis. The treatment helped me make remarkable changes in my life during the first few years. Initially the side effects from Adderall were a real nuisance. Fast forward 13 years and I started seeing diminished benefit so I discontinued Adderall. A year later it was apparent that I needed to resume some type of treatment. Due to my increase in age, doctors wanted to try Strattera. I've been medicated on Strattera for over 2 months. I had almost decided to throw in the towel but finally noticed some changes. I feel like my mood, decision making skills and overall energy are improving. The drug has no affect on concentration compared to Adderall so we will need to address that. A great side affect is that my desire to over-eat has  diminished! My appetite is controlled but not erased the way it was on Adderall.",6,23
Strattera,"They said I could experience insomnia, constipation, and nausea and that if I stuck with it they may go away. I got all the side effects after 4 days taking this and not sleeping at all, having absolute constipation on lock down and feeling like I just rode the zipper at the county fair if I so much as sat in a vehicle or turned my head too fast . I stopped taking this stuff! It took another 5 days to SLOWLY get back to being able to sleep, being able to use the rest room normally and once again experiencing no nausea. I would recommend reject any  Doctor who prescribes this  and run if they try to use you as a guinea pig and push the medicine on you!",1,13
Strattera,"I took Strattera 10mg for a few days but had to stop. Even at 10mg, constant headaches, tiredness, hot flashes, heart palpitations and my skin felt tight and a bit itchy. There was more but I'll stop there. No thanks. I know some people say wait it out for 4-6 weeks because its worth it, but I have a feeling, given how terrible I feel on it that It won't work out. Everyone is different and while it will probably work for other people, It's not working with me. It's also very expensive.",1,14
Strattera,"The first 2 months on it are awesome... focus, drive, energy.. but I need a nap 5 hours after I take it. Then theres a shift. Ive done this twice..: Taking 80mg for 2 months then all of a sudden, Im ANGRY. Agitated. Outbursting. CANNOT focus to save my life.. And EXHAUSTED. Ive never tried Ritalin but I may now.",4,11
Strattera,"I have been using this for 7 months, starting at 40mg and slowly increasing to 80mg. I have had no side effects other that tiredness, but also no impact on symptoms.",3,15
Strattera,"I got diagnosed with ADHD-PI (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive) and chronic depression last year at 24, this is one of the best medicines for ADHD. I struggle with inattention and mind chatter all the time, and have been in college for 7 years. However last year was my best year in college, when I was on Strattera (also known as Attentrol) with B Wellbutrin. Don't lose hope and give it at least 8-10 weeks  before you see the effects, and honestly it is unreal and has worked wonders on myself. The side effects when I first started taking this drug was pretty intense the first week, but after that I gradually started with 20mg a day to 60mg a day now. The mind chatter was gone in a week, with my attention significantly improving. We live in a society where Patience is no longer a virtue and people want results ASAP. That will not happen with Strattera, but if you were to give it a few weeks, then you would exactly know what I am talking about.",10,63
Strattera,"Ive tried most, if not all of the AHDH medications, and this is the only one to work. However, I have found the side effects to be unbearable. It causes the worst nausea, that makes you want to skip breakfast AND lunch. I have tried nausea medications, but they just create more problems. The only way to reduce the nausea is to eat, which is the one thing I just dont want to do. So, Im stuck without medication.",4,12
Strattera,This medication is wonderful. Has improved my concentration and no side effects. Of course no medication is going to be perfect but no issues with this one.,10,29
Strattera,Worst experience of my life. I couldn't handle the side effects for a second day. About 1 hour after taking it I was exhausted slept for about 2 hours woke up disoriented with a killer headache cotton mouth and goosebumps. I didn't want to get up or do anything. I had to pee every 20-30 minutes. Felt sad couldn't sleep well the next day. I had forgotten most of what happened the day before. I told my Dr and they didn't believe me but told me they could prescribe me an anti anxiety med. I went in for my ADHD I don't understand her reasoning.,1,13
Strattera,Today is fifteenth day with strattera. Actually its pretty good. But I'm really really emotional. This morning I cried because my girlfriend didn't have sex with me -_-,9,22
Strattera,I used it for 5 days before having a near psychotic break. I do not recommend.Ever.,1,16
Strattera,"It didnt work and I wasted weeks increasing the doses (with horrible side effects) to prove that didnt work. There was a couple of days with the high dose that seemed like it was doing something.. I had terrible hot flashes, chills, nauseas, palpitations... and they lasted for weeks. With the first dose it took me also one day for the side effects to disappear, but with the higher dose it took 3 weeks to complete disappear without bringing any good effect.",3,7
Strattera,"I suffer from drug and alcohol addiction so it is important (for me) to steer clear of stimulants. I have awful ADHD, so my doc started me on strattera a couple months ago and my fidgeting and inability to focus have both lessened dramatically. I started with 80mg for one week, then jumped straight to 100mg. My very first day I experienced mild nausea along with 6 straight hours of goosebumps (weird, but whatever), but no side effects since. It has helped me a lot and I'm glad I'm on it.",9,32
Strattera,Strattera works well for me. Lets be straight with the facts folk. Strattera should be dosed at least to 1.2 mg /per kilo body weight  Or 80 mg a day (optimal dose for most people) - if you take less then 1.2 mg/kg the risk is high that the effect that you feel is too low or placebo - (this is proven in lots of real life medical trials).  After about 6-8 weeks (during which your blood pressure is taken regularly) - its effect should be evaluated by your doctor - please have patience with the medicine to work.  If the response is to low - it should be dosed up to 100 mg or higher. A doctor should know this things - its mandatory in Sweden to have this knowledge among doctors below 80mg a day is SUBOPTIMAL dosing. 100-120 mg should not be exceeded. This fact in the medical sheet/package with your medicine. Please inform your doc about this simple facts.,8,30
Strattera,Strattera is the most efficient medication for me. It helps with my concentration in class and at home.  It started working for me the first day I took it and Ive been taking it for more than a year now.  It used to give me dizziness when I took it in the morning after breakfast... so something helpful I found is to take it after dinner on a full stomach so that the side affects dont occur while I am awake because they ware off as you are sleeping.,10,27
Strattera,Not good only took a 25mg pill went to zombie status. Not good,1,6
Strattera,18 yr old haven't been treated for my ADHD till now. Took a month before I adjusted to them afterwards I was alright. It helps me maintain focus while balancing out my emotions that seemed to go up in the day and down at night. It makes me feel like I can truly be myself and become self sufficient and independent when I need to be. Had issues with starting/completing chores and now I remember what I'm doing just fine! A great alternative for those who don't want stimulants or have inattentive ADHD.,10,26
Strattera,"Tried it last year, it was great for my confidence, libido, and overall well being. It started to keep me up at night for at least a couple hours however, and I was experiencing painful nerve pain on my right calf muscle. I was also losing hair, which I attributed to another medication I was on. I started back up this year at a much lower dosage, and experienced the same leg pain and started to lose my hair again! Also strange that it treats ADHD however I had troubles reading a book. Had to quit due to these unfortunate, odd side effects.",7,10
Strattera,"I have been taking this medication for about a week now for ADD at 40mg. I had nausea the first couple of days and slight headaches. I decided to take one day off from it, and I have had a migraine all day. Medicine can sort of help with focus especially for me since severely scatter brained and forgetful and definitely suppresses appetite.",0,11
Strattera,"I've been on Strattera for 4 months so far. I had no luck in the beginning with this medication, no difference until he upped the dosage to 80 MG. The only bad thing is feeling nauseated, sluggish. Overall my focus is way better.",0,11
Strattera,"I started it taking it when I had no motivation, was super depressed and suicidal. It helped me. I stopped having obsessive thoughts and gave the will to get up and so stuff. However that was just the first year, after that I lost perception of what life is like with our without the drug.  the first 2 weeks I had headaches and horrible nausea.",9,12
Strattera,Straterra made me feel like a zombie. It did not help me focus. I actually focused less. I was always incredibly exhausted and I was sleeping 16 hours a day.,0,14
Strattera,"My 9 year old was diagnosed with ADHD with anxiety.  The pediatrician wanted to try a non-stimulant in an effort to not exacerbate the anxiety.  Made sense.  However, this did NOT work for my daughter and in fact caused her to become an emotional wreck.  She was constantly fighting with her sisters and having one meltdown after another. We kept letting this go thinking it was just her adjusting until one night she had a meltdown that was so terrifying and said that she wanted to die, she is worthless and an awful person. A 9 year old!!  Never was she like that before!  So, we called the doctor the next day, he took her off immediately and prescribed a stimulant medication, Concerta.  What a miracle. It was like a fog lifted!",0,21
Strattera,I was a happy but chaotic woman with ADHD. I am looking for a substitute for Ritalin because although it worked miracles for my lack of attention an organizing skills it eventually wore me out. My new neurologist suggested Strattera (80 mg/day ). At first it made me very tired. After a few weeks Strattera changed me into an emotional wreck. Crying every minute for no reason. I'm still in hospital. I'm so tired of trying something new and hoping it will make the fog in my head disappear. But we're back to square one. No more Strattera fore me...,1,30
Strattera,"Worked great for ADHD! Did cause migraines to be more frequent and is expensive, but does do wonders for inattention.",9,16
Strattera,"Started Strattera treatment two months ago and it has been amazing. I can focus like a normal person (25 years old, 82 kg), without the need of glancing at my phone every two minutes. I could even listen to people and not having the need of interrupting them as always. I had some side effects (dry mouth, if I wake up too fast I get dizzy, difficulties to pee sometimes, sometimes erections are difficult to keep) but I can live with them since they not always happen. I can have orgasms like normal and I sleep like a baby since I take it. Everything went better but honestly, like every drug for ADHD, it's better to make short pauses to evaluate whether you need to change or suspend the treatment. I really recommend it.",8,27
Strattera,"My daughter is 11 years old and she has been on 10mg of strattera for 28 days and has just jumped to 18mg. My concerns are the side effects. Skin rash, headaches and severe stomach cramps since going onto the higher dosage. Do I persist or take her off? Doctor wants me to persist but I am worried I am doing more harm. She battles to fall asleep taking pill at 6pm and in bed at 8:15pm. She cried every morning because she is tired. Should I be taking it in the morning?",3,7
Strattera,"I think this may be my third review of Strattera, I still give it a high rating because all in all it has done what it was supposed to do. I've had some bad migraines, while on it, and I've gone off it a few times, because I couldn't fill the script or felt like it wasn't working, but I have always come back to taking it in the past four years. My current dose is 25mg, and I also take Adderall, 10mg twice a day. If I had to describe Strattera, it is a great focus/ motivation medication, but it also ups the anxiety, and adderall seems to up it even more. My doctor really doesn't have another solution than to take ativan. Coffee makes Strattera worse, but sometimes it won't kick in without the morning coffee.",10,38
Strattera,For a little while it did make my ADHD feel better but all of a sudden extreme depression hit me and I was sleeping ALL of the time!,3,20
Strattera,"I only took this for 4 weeks &amp; most say it takes 4-6 weeks to work. Initial side effects-- extreme sedation &amp; emotional flattening. I slept the first week anytime I wasn't actively engaged in something &amp; even then I was groggy. That subsided a bit, but I remained very lethargic all day every day for the duration of the 4 weeks &amp; as time went on, I felt more &amp; more emotionally flat &amp; lost all interest &amp; motivation. It certainly completely cured my hyper-activity, but it never helped my focus one bit. It did, however, really help my fibro pain better than anything has, took away my panic attacks, &amp; cut my general anxiety down greatly. Unfortunately, I can't continue to feel so flat, lethergic, anti-social &amp; disinterested any longer.",0,33
Strattera,"So I've been using Strattera 40-50-60mg since 8 months. The 50 and 60 mg dose got me very confused and I made a lot of mistakes at my job so I stopped and restart with 40 mg. At the beginning the most common side effects were: nausea, dry mouth, constipation and sinus headache.. but it stopped after a couple of weeks.  However, I started to get migraines (got 5 since I take strattera)... and I haven't got one for the last 6 years before (I'm 22 years old and I had a lot of migraines when I was 10-16 years old)... so I will stop taking the medicine. I also hurt my esophagus scphincter while vomiting cause of a migraine.. and now I have GERD. So even if it makes me feel very calm and I can eat and sleep, I think I'll be better without it.",5,17
Strattera,"My parents took me in for testing in 5th grade because of lacking in school, failing at best. A few years later in high school I went to my therapist for extreme anxiety and my PCP diagnosed me with ADHD. I was put on strattera at age 16. Worked amazing almost right away. My only side effects were extreme dry mouth for a few weeks and loss of appetite . I also lost about 20 pounds. Which I was pleased with because I've always struggled with being over weight. I was doing better in school.  Being able to focus on papers and projects and for the first time even doing my homework and turning it in on time. My self confidence grew tremendously also. I made better eating choices and wasn't anxious. Now 25 and starting again! No side effects so far",10,41
Strattera,"Started taking  60mg of this medicine for ADD &amp;  anxiety triggered my ADD.  It took about a week to hit my system, while it helped somewhat with my ADD. It wasn't major. I was still forgetting things like crazy and was able to be side tract.  It's been 13 days and I'm stopping it today.  It has made me an emotional WRECK!!!! I've had CRAZY mood swings like seen in a damn horror movie. Yesterday, I woke up happy then saw puppy shit on the floor and I LOST IT.  I was a crying wreck. It was so bad I laid on my floor and screamed tears! I've never been depressed insane.  Couldn't find my shoes- crying screaming mess again.  Left the laundry in the washer over night- another HUGE breakdown.",1,22
Strattera,"This medication has worked great for my son!  Family history of ADHD and possibly bi-polar.  Recently noticed my son has been talking in his sleep.  Nothing to worry about but just an obvious side effect.  2nd week in on 18 mg.  This is the 2nd time we have tried the Strattera and it seems to be a very effective medication for focus and concentration, helping the anxiety and frustrations.  He also has quite a long list of differences like dyslexia, ADHD and dyspraxia which contribute to a slight depression.  The Strattera seems to help with everything including the impulsivity.  Depression seems to fade and life goes on.  Just wanted to make note for anyone that may be interested or taking this medication that talking in sleep is a side effect.",9,34
Strattera,"I had such high hopes for this med to work out but it simply does not do it for me. I have suffered with ADD my entire life and after being over medicated on anti-depressants, bi-polar meds and anxiety meds my neurologist put me on this. I did not want to take another drug that could possibly become addictive however now that I have been on it for 8 months and get almost no relief I do plan on switching to something different. It may work for some but did not do well for me personally.",2,11
Strattera,"I have been on this med 4 days now. The first day I made the mistake of taking it night before bed, boy was that s mistake! Up all night really bad insomnia. Day 2 I took it in the afternoon when home from work at 2 pm. I curled up on lazy boy and did not want to move, ended passing out due to pure exhaustion, needless to say I did not get up till the next morning 15 hrs later. Day 3 about 1 hour after taking developed slight nausea and the feeling of extreme skin sensations like things crawling on me , but those do subside after about couple hours. On 40 mg and going to stick with it and ride it out for a few weeks to see is side effects lessen. Also on 450mg of Wellbutrin at the same time. I think it is working in a weird kind of way!!",6,17
Strattera,"My nine year old son was put on this for impulsivity, lack of ability to pay attention and retain things at school, and to help the spazzy moments. At first he was a walking zombie so we gave it at night. Eventually he was able to switch to taking it in the morning as his body got used to it. But still he would crash as soon as he got home from school. He says the medicine makes it hard for him to sleep in anymore even though he's tired. He is less spazzy and can pay attention better. But I don't know what to do about the emotional roller coaster we get from him being so tired from it towards the late afternoon or evenings. He just seems too sedated. I want him to be able to focus. But not be blah. It seems like it took his happiness.",3,28
Strattera,"I took this med for ADHD with hopes of helping w/anxiety &amp; depression. I had headaches right away and began lying in bed all day long. I wanted this to work so I stuck with it despite constipation, dry mouth/eyes and headaches. My mood was worsened and I had a flat affect. I didn't laugh for two weeks. It wasn't until I stopped taking it that I realized how depressed it had made me. Once out of my system, my libido also returned. Drugs change the brain chemistry and for some it works, for others it doesn't. Straterra is not for me.",1,20
Strattera,"Strattera has changed my life, my relationships, and the way I feel about my self. This drug takes time to get into your system mine took about 2 months, with some uncomfortable side effects at first, but one you over come those this medicine truly works. The problem is most people just want to jump to the next drug. I feel like a normal human being I'm no longer extremely reactive, irritable, irrational, and emotionally all over. I have found to be emotional yet stable (I'm not just some zombie) I am not constantly making impulse decisions. I have improved my relationships with my family and friends and feel finally like my self and have control over my life. So great film and I hope many others find the same happiness. female 21",9,70
Strattera,Absolutely a joke... gave me rage and did nothing for my ADHD symptoms. PASS!,1,19
Strattera,"Strattera is a wonderful ADHD medication if you know how it works for you. For me it takes a solid 8 weeks before the full effect of the Medication kicks in to full potential. When it does. I have a superb memory through paying attention. My Dr. Increased it from 40mg when it worked well but not well enough. To 80mg. Then I had to restart the 8 weeks. Like the 40mg,  I started noticing a difference in 5 weeks. After 6th week it's a perfect mix. Superb focus that seems to get better week after week. I'm glad I gave the Statterra a chance.",9,46
Strattera,"Has helped me a lot with focusing and getting tasks done. I had some nausea during my first and second weeks. Taking it with food was helpful. Overall, it worked pretty well for me.",8,25
Strattera,"Awful experience with this drug after taking it for 5 weeks.  Started on 40mg for 4 weeks, then went to 80mg.  Stopped using it after 1 week on 80mg.  All adverse symptoms became much worse and no relief for ADD at all.  Extreme tiredness, dizzy when sitting up, insomnia, intestinal pains and moderate burning during ejaculation.  Was formerly using Adderall for 20 years which worked great, but because of a recent heart attack at age 50, my doctor recommended a change to Strattera.  To me, this medication was just awful.  The worst of the side effects were complete lethargy/sluggishness and insufferable insomnia. Now I will continue to look for another Adderall replacement or asking my doctor about possibly trying a lower Adderall dose.",1,16
Strattera,"Female, 28 and have been on Strattera for 5 months and it has changed my life.  Went back to a college to finish my high-school degree, after having dropped out of high school in year 9 due to pure inability to focus. I was always in a daydream before this med. Motivation is increased 10x fold. I also had panic attack disorder with half a dozen panic attacks every day! About 3 weeks into this med and the anxiety lifted. Anxiety is 100% gone. No other med in my life has ever done that. Not even actual anxiety medications.  I'm more social. Have more energy and general satisfaction with life.  I am so happy with this medication and truly believe this is an absolute miracle medication. I think this medication is more for people who have ADHD-PI",9,77
Strattera,"-- Initial ramp up weeks made me sleepy and very cloudy. Good luck if you manage a team at work or have a detailed oriented job. -- The best period lasted for a couple of months. Sleeping was normal and I felt pretty clear-headed. However, it made my emotions neutral to almost everything. Like a cardboard cut-out of the real me. No laughing at jokes. No natural sense of urgency when the situation called for one.  -- Then the side-effects really kicked in. I would get dizzy when standing up. Then dizzy just sitting up in bed. I recall I read something about it can mess with your blood pressure. The gray cardboard cutout feeling got much stronger, plus I could not easily carry on a conversation during meetings.",1,19
Strattera,I am a really happy person and this drug made me depressed. I did not want to hang out with my friends and I would randomly cry. Do not do it.  It does not even help with your ADHD,1,15
Strattera,"I am a 27 year old male, on this drug for 3 weeks so I can't really comment on it's efficacy, as it takes 2-4 weeks to start working. All I can say is it didn't help me. I took 40mg for 7 days, then went up to 80mg for 2 weeks. I had to stop taking it because of the side effects - I was getting severe irritability to the point where I was yelling at the top of my lungs at people for minor mistakes and generally grumpy. Based on this and other side effects - needing to urinate far more regularly than usual, heart palpitations, feeling down for no good reason and insomnia - my doctor decided it wasn't right for me.This is a rare reaction which is unlikely to happen to you, but if you get it, tell your doctor.",2,18
Strattera,"I read all these reviews and I still took it. I told my doctor about the reviews and my concerns and she pushed me to try it so I did. Progressively I could not leave my house. I was so tired. I could only have the strength to shower once every 9 days. I felt myself becoming more and more tired and for some reason I just stayed with it- I gradually increased the dosage and ate it with food, all the tips everyone's said I've done because I wanted it so badly to work. But it has made me sick and I'm not sure if I've recovered even now, a month after stopping. The final straw was me starging to feel worse I had been in years. Please do not be like me. I saw the reviews and I did not listen.",1,21
Strattera,"I started taking this medication about 2 months ago. My doc had me start out at 40 milligrams for one week and then upped the dose to two 40 mg capsules twice a day. At the second month, I started taking just one 80 mg capsule around mid-afternoon early evening every day. So far the drug has seemed to greatly help my ability to focus and really experience the world around me. I'm able to finally slow my mind to a cruising speed instead of an outright race. Strattera has made me calmer and more composed when it comes to social interactions with others and encountering stressful situations. Also, I seem to be getting really positive and more optimistic in everyday life making me feel as if the drug as some mild antidepressant properties",7,36
Strattera,Water pill worked about as well without the terrible side effects.,1,8
Strattera,"The first meds prescribed to me (NZ) male 19, Stopped taking this immediately, experience almost all the side effects and it is not worth it for me as the body seems to hate it. May be worth a shot for you but I'm not taking this rubbish for 4 weeks to get any benefit for ADHD symptoms not worth all these side effects IMO. Plus I was told I can't stop it once I build it up in my system. No thanks feels like poison in me",1,10
Strattera,"This medication sucks. I took 20mg Adderall XR, which worked wonderfully for my ADHD, for a month, but had to get off of it, because I have Tourette Syndrome and Adderall aggravated my tics. My physician then put me on Strattera. It is extremely expensive, since it is patented until May 2017, and I was given a sample 6-week starter titration pack (from 25mg to 80mg). I took a 25mg capsule last night around 7 PM, and an hour later, I was nauseous/lost my appetite, and I experienced sexual dysfunction (it took over an hour to reach a burning, painful orgasm). The next day (today), I am constipated and depressed. I'd recommend clonidine or guanfacine before trying this garbage for ADHD.",1,5
Strattera,"I was diagnosed with ADHD late and started Strattera about a year ago. When one gets a diagnosis like this late in life, one contemplates missed opportunities along the way, so I was very hopeful at the beginning. My insurance balked, because it was only approved for children, but eventually, I started it. A year later, I stopped. I don't know what the reasons are, but I felt no effects whatsoever. I stopped about a month ago, and never even noticed anything since stopping. I know doctors don't want to prescribe amphetamines or opiates or anything which has even the slightest risk of dependency. Fine. Then what? And what is out there for adults with ADHD?",1,13
Strattera,"Started off on Webutrin (Bupoprion) because Strattera was non-formulary and required approval that didn't meet my schedule.  Switched, and noticed a dip in mood, but figured that it was some sort of withdrawal from being off Welbutrin. Started at 20mg P.O. for 10 days with no effect, increased dosage to 40mg as scheduled.  Strange dreams, not quite nightmares.  unusual temperature regulation, cold chest, sweating legs.  Started to experience severe difficulty in just getting out of bed, started to have significant irritability and being outright enraged over some things.  Started to experience signs of depression.  Girlfriend noticed and said that she was actually worried about me.   Called doc, was advised to stop. 36 hrs back to normal.",1,14
Strattera,"Well, started taking strattera around 6 weeks back, had ADHD since I was a child. (23 now) been on ritilin and a couple of other ones when I was young, can't remember the name of the other two. Took myself off the meds when I was old enough to leave school, looking at how people are describing their children's symptoms are bringing it all back. How every day at school trying to eat was the biggest challenge, YES I could sit still, YES I was well behaved but all the time every day I just felt ill. All some parents and mostly schools care about is if every child in the room is quiet and being educated. I'd never felt so free when I took myself off the meds. Strattera is kind of working for me now but is causing a lot of changes to my body",6,15
Strattera,"My daughter was diagnosed with ADD in the  1st grade.  I didn't want to start her on a stimulant right away and our pediatrician recommended we try Strattera.  I am happy to say that my daughter is now in 11th grade and has been on Straterra her entire time in school...we went through all the ups and downs of titrating the meds, which combo worked and which upset her tummy but all in all this has been the best med for her.  She is now on 80 mg and has been since she stopped growing.  Unfortunately, the meds have gotten extremely expensive and even with a coupon, I will have to pay over $350/month to keep her on this until we hit our $5,600 deductible.  I am very disappointed in the manufacturer that they have hiked the meds so high.",10,25
Strattera,"Strattera is the worst ADHD medicine I've ever been on!  I was originally on Ritalin (worked well, but not long enough), then on Vyvance (worked great but doctor didn't like my higher blood pressure) and now I'm finally off Strattera after being on it for 11 months, because it didn't work!  My doctor is concerned about high blood pressure that can trigger heart attacks and strokes.  I'm having lots of problems coming off the Strattera.  My doctor is not willing to help with a medication change. Doctors don't know what it is like to experience the problems of ADHD and what we go through.",1,22
Strattera,Well I been on this medication since I was 9 to about 13 years on age and I was wondering was that a to long amount of years on medication I'm 19 now,3,0
Strattera,Hey all! I've seen where some people have mentioned the cost of Strattera. I have insurance and my copay was still $45. I actually got online and googled Strattera discount cards and my pharmacy let me use it on top of my insurance. My prescription ended up being free and I can still get a discounted price each month so I'm pretty stoked!,10,25
Strattera,"Struggled with life at home, at work, with relationships. I have never taken stimulants, and I had anxiety and ADHD. Straterra has changed my life.  Anxiety - gone Attention - noticeably improved. This is a medication you have to be patient with.    1st 2 weeks - felt like I was going to pass out of pure exhaustion, constipation, felt zero improvement (40mg.) 3rd week - anxiety amazingly disappeared  (60mg.).  - Realized my confusion was in fact anxiety  (not lack of intelligence).  - Job performance - started seeing noticeable improvement to the point to where I was amazing myself.  - Obsessive thoughts - gone - Can sit in my seat for longer periods of time and easily tackle many tasks like it's a piece of cake! - Handle stress with ease",10,81
Strattera,"My 16 year old son was diagnosed with ADHD at age 4. We went through several meds at first and Concerta worked the best for him. He took the drug for 10 years increasing dosage when needed. Things seemed to be fine or at least better on the med than off. This last year he became impossible to live with. Argumentative (more than normal), irritable at home, mouthy and his grades were tanking! I initially chalked it up to regular teenagerhood! Then I had an inkling that maybe he needed to switch meds. He started taking Strattera on Monday and 4 days later is a different kid. PLEASANT is the first word that comes to mind. WOW, no arguments! No mouthiness! He left just now I said, have fun, I love you! He replied Love you too! Wha??? HAPPY MOM!!!",8,35
Strattera,I am just starting to take this medication. I'm 54 years old. I was diagnosed ADHD in 2006 but never took this medication. I hope I'm not making a mistake. For now my insurance pays for it 100% because I met my out of pocket max for the year. I have harken insurance which is phenomenal insurance if you can get it. It's not offered in every state but Georgia is one.   It sounds very expensive but the main point is that it helps my the ability to focus and be more productive and not feel tired or irritable,0,12
Strattera,"I started give this medication to my 7years old we started with 18mg, 25mg and now 40mg, no change on his behavior yet 40mg it only been 2wks that he is taking it, but one thing is he is more aggressive, crying a lot but I am going to continue for 2more wks to see if any changes after that definitely I will call the doctor to change this med.",4,9
Strattera,"First of all, unless Strattera is seriously messing with your brain, you should really be patient and keep taking it to see if it really works. I thought several times about quitting, but since I have been fighting depression and ADHD my whole life, why not give it another month to take effect? I started a month at 25mg, a month at 40mg, and about 2 weeks at 80mg. Wow, have things really taken off for me! I am getting so much done at home and am motivated to get a job again! The one downside is the cost. Seriously? My insurance won't cover it so my 80mg prescription was almost $500! To combat nausea, take with food always! It may interact with vitamins too, so take those at the opposite time of day. Most side effects went away after 2 wks.",9,44
Strattera,Been on Straterra for about a month now. Only thing I've noticed is that it gives me heart burn. I've also become more agitated. Has not helped with focus at all. Still daydream. Still very forgetful. This medication really sucks for me. I know alot of Dr's hate giving stimulant drugs for ADHD but it's what helps me. I personally think if you are gonna take a non-stimulant drug you might as well take all-natural meds.,1,21
Strattera,"Hi, I'm from the UK. I have been taking  atomoxetine for roughly 5 months for my ADD which was diagnosed late. The medication had been ok. Recently it's impact on me has started to reduce. I feel that I am able to continue with tasks but am unable to apply focus on to the task. In other words I feel able to continue doing a thing but the quality of my effort seems diluted (beyond help). This is frustrating because I have to repeat things several times (such as reading things for my Masters degree). It has more or less ended other symptoms such as daydreaming, inability to continue at things, sleep problems, memory issues (though this to a smaller extent over time).I am going to get it changed though it works for some better than others.",4,12
Strattera,"I'm just starting the journey of the medication. I never wanted to be on meds cause I am a chef and did not want my taste buds affected. I have to say in one week I feel really hopeful, less irritable and focused and CLeAR. I can see my goals clear and am knocking things out one by one and not so stressed.  It's working as a anti depressant too. I'm excited. I really am. I'm reading that the journey has just began but I'm going to see it though. Adderall is a mess and we use it for a buzz and to be high all night. I actually am done with those days and want to start to get my life on track. How is it with drinking? I don't drink much but since I began to be a working chef we have a ton of wine pairings. Would be nice to join in with clients",8,30
Strattera,"Strattera was my first treatment after I was diagnosed with ADHD PI for six months. First week on 40 mg, then 80 mg and the last three months on 100 mg. I didn't improve any symptom, but it worsen everything. I got negative effects, from the sexual side (no erections just after taking Strattera,). My mood was really unstable, with peeks of depressing episodes and rage outbursts on the last weeks. Now I'm quitting it, and I got some discontinuing effect as tension on my head and anxiety. On the next week I'll start with methyphenidate and I hope the best.",1,15
Strattera,"I have aspergers and ADD and started taking strattera when I was about 9 or 10. And in just two months I lost over 20 kg (44 pounds) I was so skinny but I didn't change because I had tried everything else and this was the smallest side effects I had so far. But after I quit just over a month ago (I'm 17 now) I realized that the medication had caused me to have severe depression for all my childhood, I'm really happy for the first time in forever. and the medication had made me more angry and restless than when not taking them.",4,11
Strattera,"I've been taking Strattera since I was finally diagnosed in February with predominately inattentive type ADHD and I think I might stop taking it altogether. It's helped with my attention span a little, but the side effects largely overshadow this. I have never experienced such agonizing headaches since I started taking this medication, to the point where I've had to call off work several times because I'm so nauseous from the pain. It might just be the combination of medications (I also take Wellbutrin, Zoloft, and Trazodone), but I'd rather live without the headaches than continue taking Strattera hoping it will one day work.",4,11
Strattera,"I have taken Strattera for almost 5 years now and its a wonder drug for me personally.  Without this drug my mind really really races and I can help it with exercise and things like that to get the energy out, but I'm not on the same beat as others.  When I take Strattera, everything slows down and I'm on the same beat and wavelength as everyone else.  Social conversations go better and I'm able to stay on task with work and actually get things done. I've found taking it on an empty stomach can be bit sickening, but other than that no downsides for me.  I take 40 mg 1 or 2x a day as needed and find it wears off in 6-8 hours for me. I'm extremely ADHD but have no depression at all, very happy person always have been.",10,54
Strattera,"People bad talk this stuff but it has helped me immensely with attention span, focus, socializing, depression, and my executive function overall. Helped almost immediately for me. Very few side effects. Good stuff",9,43
Strattera,"Great stuff. Like any ADD med, if you have underlying depression or anxiety, I can see how this could exacerbate it. Caffeine used to make me super depressed. Take care of your depression before starting a stimulant. Anyways, this stuff is great. Vyvanse would make me super edgy and basically feel like ripping the world's juggler out with my bare hands. This stuff feels like that peak 5 minutes of coffee where you're like 'damn I wish this could last all day!' I sleep way better, I have a ton more energy. Things done bother me as much as they used to so I can focus on my work more However, you should really work out to burn it off otherwise you could get a little aggressive. I know that I really don't put up with any shit while I'm on it",8,35
Strattera,"Was only on this for 4 days. I yook 25mg in the mornings. The side effects were bad and got progressively worse. My head felt weird and also headaches that lasted hours on end. Took extra long to fall asleep the third day. I barely ate the third and fourth day because the naseua was so bad. I would eat something small then feel like vomitting. The last day I tried to take it before bedtime as directed to try to sleep through the bad parts, but ended up calling off work because of severe insomnia. I would not recommend this stuff for anyone. Stay away from this stuff!",1,11
Strattera,"28 year old female.I have both positives and negative effects. I have been on Strattera for six weeks Side effects constipation,dry mouth,anger and terrible insomnia. I cannot sleep even after taking zoplicone 7.5mg I struggle and when I eventually do get to sleep I don't sleep for more than 5 hours and its always broken I wake up several times so am always left feeling exhausted. My mood swings however have massive improved, pretty much stopped which I'm very happy about. Only complaint with mood is that I seem to become very angry over little things, I have had several arguments when I have always suffered with anxiety so am not confrontational at all.I am not happy and going to consult my psychiatrist regarding changing meds",3,11
Strattera,This drug literally sedates me lol. I honestly naturally function at 1000mph from the second I wake up. I've never had to drink coffee in my life until I started taking strattera... So I guess the drug made me normal. Also my troubles in school went away along with impulsiveness and bad decisions.,0,25
Strattera,"I see a lot of mixed reviews on this. It's obvious this drug is EXTREMELY helpful on some and on others its completely ineffective, and can even do harm. My suggestion is to try it out for a month. If you don't feel the effects of it, try it for another month and if you still don't then switch to another drug. If you start feeling agitated by it, get off it immediately. For me strattera has worked wonders. I am 18 years of age, and have noticed the effects after my 4th week of taking it. My mind feels clearer, and I feel more motivated to focus on things I would usually find boring. The effects are reflected in my ACT score: my score has gone up a whole 6 points since first taking it. I wholeheartedly recommend strattera to anyone with ADD.",10,38
Strattera,This stuff must've been brewed up by a demon in the depths of hell cause it was awful.  I can't explain the feeling when it kicked in other than I wasn't prepared and I could definitely feel it kick in.  Also it was too much for me to really be helpful.. I felt a lot like i did when I tried to take vivanse once and it was so bad I threw the stuff away and years later I'm just trying to get back on meds.  Well it also makes me really tired and agitated but it's difficult to sleep after it kicks in because for the next three or four hours if just hits me in waves.  A week into taking it I started getting so bummed I eventually started feeling suicidal.  Will never take this stuff again.,1,16
Strattera,"I see a lot of people bad mouth this medication. It works extremely well for me, and I responded within just a few days. My psych doc says he has a number of patients that this med worked well for as well. It is also an effective antidepressant for me. Just my experience.",9,33
Strattera,"We started strattera 10mg then 18mg then 25mg for our 9yr old. In the beginning it was great, after about 5 days of each dose it was clearly time to increase to the next dose, but now we have been at 25 mg for over a month and the impulsivity and anger has gotten worse again over the past 2 weeks or so, and we can't increase the dose any further. Will be calling her doctor Monday to change to something else. An alarming thing to me is that she is also sad and crying a whole lot, which is new. This child never cried before.",2,24
Strattera,My 6 year old son (ADHD/Autism) starting taking Strattera about 6 months ago because he had a bad reaction to stimulant medicine. Was on 20 mg and it did not help him.  The doctor increased it to 40mg and now he cries all the time and about everything.  His concentration is still really bad.  I will be talking to his doctor soon.,1,20
Strattera,I started taking Straterra in February of'16. About three weeks ago I began to cry at the drop of a hat. Three days ago my depression worsened and began to become almost delusional with themes of guilt. I feel better since I stopped yesterday and today. I will ask my Psychiatrist to take me off and commence with Vyvanse. Crying and emotionally labile isn't me. I'm glad I stopped it before I hurt myself.,1,11
Strattera,"unbelievably bad ,seems to exaggerate  all of my adhd problems 4 fold . i started on 40 mg even though im 91kg in weight and ive read up and they say it should be a mg per kg . so im guessing my doc was cautious , not a bad thing.So i went to 60 mg things didnt change i was wanking 4 times a day and sleeping only 3-5 hours a night and hardly eating a thing .i cant be arsed typing any more",1,12
Strattera,"I'm 36 yr old female who has been on Strattera for 8 months. When I started back to college full-time my focus was a mess and it took me hours to write the simplest of papers. Growing up I greatly struggled in school and clearly it was due to undiagnosed ADD. As an adult I was diagnosed w depression/gen anxiety but never found much relief from medications. Once I began the 80mg dose of Strattera, I was sleeping better, able to focus in class and at home while tackling work and much of my anxiety is gone. Over the break my dr suggested some people take a med break , so I did -- now realizing what a huge difference it made for me. Side effects in the beginning were heartburn, but I took a Xanax w dose and it subsided in about a month.",10,31
Strattera,"This drug works mildly, not as well as stimulant medications like adderall.   Unfortonately while it mildly boosted concentration and motivation it severely increased my anxiety, ,heart rate, and tremors.   Stimulant medications actually decreased my natural tremors.   My pupils were always dialated as well.  To me this drug is a stimulant like super caffeine not a medicational stimulant.",3,10
Strattera,"My experience with this drug is a bitter sweet one. However, the bitter side to it overpowers the sweet by LONG SHOT. Since I was a kid, I've had behavioral issues and it wasn't until I was in my mid teens that they began to truly effect my way of life and my relationships with those around me. I had been taking Bupropion in combination with Sertraline and had no serious problem or complaints. However, when I started to wean off of the Sertral and began taking the Strattera, I began to get irritated and just downright pissed off for no apparent reason. The slightest things set me off, and it's only gotten worse with increased dosage. I'm gonna stop taking it all together. Screw a bunch of this unprovoked anger stuff. It helps no one.",3,22
Strattera,"I'm giving it a 5 for the moment. I just started it last week and it looks like I'll have to commit at least 2-3 months to see if it really helps. The first week, I was on 25mg and I could feel the change in productivity and lack of procrastination. However, when talking to people, I almost felt like I was over focusing which resulted in not hearing what they were saying at all. I did have a couple of days of facial flushing and water retention. Today I started 60mg and I haven't been as lethargic and tired in a long time! I got hardly anything done. My eyes were burning because I just wanted to sleep. I felt down on myself for being so lazy.",5,20
Strattera,"Strattera was like water through my system, dirty water; did nothing except give me terrible distress: Stomach aches, terrible constipation, nausea, constant dry heaves, and, at last, vomiting that almost had me fail my last school semester. Oh, did I mention the irritability at all the side effects? Had to quit cold turkey",1,14
Strattera,I have been taking Straterra for 2 years now! Side effects are awful at the beginning and last 6-8 weeks! I feel normal now and I don't have the irratability I had on other medicines. I think it depends on the person.,9,28
Strattera,great drug with few if any side effects.... especially in adults.,10,21
Strattera,"My Doctor put me on basically the fastest titration. 40mg for 4 days then 80mg after that. The first 4 days on 40mg were awful. The worst of the side effects being insomnia. I had to call out of the work for the a few days to catch up on sleep. I could not fall asleep at ALL. The Doc prescribed Trazadone to sleep. That helped after being sleeped deprived for a few days. I've heard of people upping their dose and having the side effects lessen and positive side effects increased. WRONG. First day on 80mg I had crippling nausea, body aches, massive headache, off the chart irritability, burning urination (with white discharge), and thoughts of SUICIDE. No joke. I've read of people having this happen them but it's a rare side effect.",1,17
Strattera,"Diagnosed with ADD this year, I initially wanted to go without medications. Being a senior in college I have deadlines, and I noticed my grades suffering significantly. I decided to give medications a try. My doctor prescribed a 6-wk starter pack of Strattera (25-80mg). I noticed a difference in attentiveness but after week 4 I felt lethargic, unmotivated, sad, impatient, VERY irritable, and depressed. I didn't go to class, didn't turn in homework and my grades took a deeper dive in that month. My psychiatrist then prescribed Vyvanse (30mg). I have been on it for a month and it helps ME stay focused without losing sleep and decreasing my appetite, best of all my grades are improving! My worse side effect is dry mouth. Hope this helps(:",1,32
Strattera,"I have had ADD for several years now (I'm 24). I was taking adderall for a while but it flared up my anxiety. I am now prescribed Strattera, and so far, no good. I'm only on day 3, but I feel absolutely exhausted and irritable. Considering giving up on it because it's the end of the school semester and I can't afford to feel this tired with all the work I have to do.",3,11
Strattera,I have never been diagnosed with add or adhd but was having trouble concentrating. I approached my doctor and he prescribed this drug. It worked perfectly. I no longer have problems paying attention and am doing extremely well in school. My inattention did not return after I stopped this medication.,10,22
Strattera,I have been  taking stratter for 3months now ! I'm more tired when I take it bad I'm assuming gas pains but I don't care for it !,3,7
Strattera,I was on Adderall and that worked amazingly!! But I was paranoid and depressed which effected me so much I had to switch. I switched to strattera and it helped! Then it started to not make a difference so I got upped to 100mgs. I have to eat right after or else I become very ill(nauseous).,8,17
Strattera,"Hey, I'm a 20 y/o Medical Assistant (Internal Medicine), After being on Strattera for about 2 months, and even though I complain about my pts not battling through side affects to achieve benefit, I as well, failed to reach the finish line.  I Re-Starting Strattera 4 months later, I think I finally figured out why this medicine is so difficult for me. I have come to realize that this medication is relatively a Shock Collar more or less. Strattera doesn't actually Help my symptoms but yet, Shocks me (Punishes me) when my symptoms show through. Every time I get distracted, or overly excited, start mono-logging thoughts in my head, etc. the side affects flare up. I dont know if this is true for everyone, but it is what i have noticed.",4,19
Strattera,while taking strattera it didn't really help with my ADHD but it did cause unwanted nausea and once I reached my target 80mg dose I began to get extremely hot then started to sweat a lot and finally threw up the strattera.,1,12
Strattera,"Strattera has proved to be quite beneficial for my cognitive performance. It has increased my memory, attention and organization of thinking. The side effects I've had have been nausea and trouble sleeping but as I keep taking it in sure it will subside more. I currently take 40 mg and working up to 80 mg.",8,23
Strattera,Strattera made me tired during the day and kept me awake at night. It was miserable at night. I took it for 3 months before I couldn't take it anymore. Now I take 200 mg of wellbutrin twice daily and that seems to help quite a bit with my moral and the way I view myself in the world. Honestly the strattera made a zombie out of me.,1,16
Strattera,"Tried Strattera for ADHD, because I wanted to try a non-stimulant.  Within about a week, I was depressed and crying over the littlest things. It was NOT for me.  Also diagnosed with anxiety, Zoloft mellowed me out, but too much so, I felt apathetic and gained weight.  Tried wellbutrin and became violently sick (throwing up.)  Adderall XR I didn't like, just felt high and tweaky.  Finally found relief in a combination of Vyvanse 30-40mg and Lamictal 150mg. Truly life changing, along with gluten/dairy free low sugar diet, and good sleep.",1,24
Strattera,"I have a now 10 yo son that was diagnosed with ADD &amp; ADHD when he was 7. His Dr. has put him on all  different types of meds since.  The only one we found that seemed to work for him, was Vyvanse, well now he's on Strattera 18 MG and I had to rush him to the ER because he was complaining about his chest bothering him, and I mean really bad.  They said he was fine, besides his heart rate,which was really really high, but they didn't see anything wrong. I mentioned he was on Strattera, and they said that the meds can be a big part of it.  I took him off of it for the next two days, and he was fine. Started him back on it, and a week later, (2/6/16) he was having pains in his chest again, so I've been trying to get a hold of his Dr to stop it.",4,11
Strattera,"My son who is 12 has been on this medication now for about 6 months. 40 mg a day. It does absolutely nothing for him. The Dr tried upping his dose to 50mg and he started having major mood swings, anxiety and depression. Ritalin, Concerta, Vyvanse we have tried those too but the side effects were too much for him to handle. I'm at a loss what to do now. No more meds I guess?",1,16
Strattera,"The first month on Strattera, I did not feel well. It made me tired and grumpy. Then, after it stopped being a nuisance, it started being nothing. No help, ZERO. Waste of time, money and liver. I quit cold turkey after my 6th month script ran out. Too expensive to continue paying a lot of money for ZERO. (I no longer had the same insurance that had a copay. I do not know how much it would have cost with my new insurance).",1,11
Strattera,"In the 6th grade I missed two consecutive days, then took my pill as I would any other day. Throughout the day I felt terrible and eventually I went to the nurse. She took my heart rate and said it would've been okay if I had just sprinted a mile, but I had been sitting in class. She checked again 10 minutes later and my heart rate was slower than it should have been at a resting state. She called my parents and I went to the doctor immediately. I had to be hooked up to machines and monitored. The nurse said I was lucky not to have a heart attack that day. I've been scared of Stratera/Adderall/Ritalin ever since.",1,12
Strattera,"My daughter 7 years old, prescribed strattera 20 mg. once a day.  I looked in here to see what happened if she didn't take it when she doesn't have school.  it doesn't make sense to me, that if it takes 2 weeks to get into the system (body) then how is it okay to skip 2 days  of taking it. wouldn't she have side affects &amp;/or take a few days after starting it again to be back to normal.",0,5
Strattera,As I was reading all the comments when I first start taking strattera I ignored  it in the beginning and I've been on it almost a month now honestly no advantages at all. My first week I almost had a fight in a restaurant because a guy parked near my car blocking it. I started throwing words at people I don't know. I became super aggressive and angry with every one my friends and family. I will see my doctor ASAP to get me out of this shit drug.,0,18
Strattera,An unusual side effect I experience is head tingling every time I urinate,0,9
Strattera,"I've been on every ADHD medication under the sun. After heavily abusing adderall and lying to my doctors, I broke out in a huge body rash that went all the way up to my face. I didn't like the way adderall made me feel. Like a zombie. I was wide awake, felt euphoric, but I didn't do anything. I just sat there for hours chainsmoking while on my phone. I decided to try straterra. I love it! It does everything adderall did minus the tweaky stimulant effect. And, I can't abuse it :) my adhd is under control,  my depression disappeared, and I feel like myself again.",8,79
Strattera,"All it did was make me feel like a zombie. I personally don't recommend this drug, as it only makes you get nauseous and very tired, and causes insomnia.",2,6
Strattera,"I am starting on a low dose as I was given a stimulant type at first, which made me feel sick and stopped me sleeping. So now I am on Atomxetine but just a low dose as I seem to suffer badly with side effects. At my recent assessment, the doc told me to increase dose to 40mg, then 80, but I decided to start on 20 mg, then 40 second week. Only I am finding I can't sleep so I am going to try to take about 2 hours before bedtime, see if that helps. Not sure what to do if these don't work ...Any advice would be grateful, thanks",5,7
Strattera,"I've taken strattera at first and didn't like it so went on adderall XR 15 mg once a day. Increased energy and increased focus.  After a while, the increased energy was TOO MUCH so I decided to try strattera. I dropped the adderall dose and took them both together for a Few weeks before discontinuing the adderall.   They feel virtually identical.  I take strattera twice a day to avoid daytime sleepiness &amp; no longer feel over stimulated and zombified and I have energy, &amp; increased focus. I did have a headache for the first couple of days. Took an adderall yesterday and yup felt identical. Could barely tell a difference except got a bad headache at the end of the day on the come down and I also felt like a zombie again. Oh yeah, no come down on strattera!",10,26
Strattera,"I was prescribed strattera 50mg once a day to go along with the 20mg of Ritalin I take 2x a day because the Ritalin doesn't cover me for later at night, because I go out almost every night with friends. The doctor said after a week or 2 it should start to work. I took it for 2 weeks and continued to get cold sweats, shivers, and just felt like crap so I stopped taking it. It didn't help one bit. It made me feel like I was on a anti depressant or something.  All around terrible experience and I will never take it again. I'm at my doctors today to rectify the situation",1,13
Strattera,"I was diagnosed with ADHD very late in life, at 55. My main symptoms are depression, anxiety, insomnia, lack of motivation/energy and a raft of others. I have tried every anti-depressant available, most of which didn't work or the side effects were too bad.  I always seem to have to take high doses of medication, and ended up on 120mg of Strattera. It didn't do much for my concentration or cognitive symptoms, but after a few months I noticed my motivation getting better. However, it caused my quite severe cardiac symptoms and the dose was dropped to 100mg. I needed to think straight, so Methylphenidate was added. This was a great combination for me, apart from the side effects which often go away given time, but in my case didn't.",8,14
Strattera,"Recently diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 22, and am a full time college student with difficulties getting my responsibilities and homework assignments done. Started on 40mg once a day with instructions to bump up to twice a day after 3 days if I needed. I refused to bump up because of the crappy effects. I know some people have had great results with this drug, but I was not one of them. The only positive thing I noticed was the ability to tune out outside noises and distractors, but those distractions your own head puts out are still there. Side effects: complete revulsion to food, sluggish and lethargic, lack of motivation or enthusiasm, and EXTREME irritability. By the 5th day, I refused to take it.",2,24
Strattera,"My doctor gave me a free sample pack of Strattera and had me start at 20mg, and increase the dose all the way to 80mg. I didn't notice a difference until I got to 60mg, and at 80mg, the side effects became all too apparent. I noticed that I was able to focus on a particular topic for longer periods of time, but that's it; my motivation, procrastination, sluggishness, irritability, memory problems, all remained the same. Now for the side effects, my head starts to itch, my testicles become very tender, but worst of all I start to get depressed. I don't think this medication is for someone without the Hyperactivity part of ADHD. Because I am sluggish enough as it is.",3,16
Strattera,"I have been looking for a medication that will keep me at a stable pace all day, not with the several ups and downs I experience on Motiron and Ritalin. I have tried Adderall, Ritalin, Straterra, and more than 3 other medications. But of all the medications I have tried, Straterra gave me the worst side effects by far. I felt sick to my stomach, irritable, toxic, I had a headache for 3-4 hours a day and the come down was terrible. I went through extreme periods of depression and anxiety while on this medication for only 2 weeks! I know some people can feel the effects after a few weeks, but for me it just wasn't worth it to continue. Hope it works for others but this non-stimulant was all side-effects and no help for my ADHD.",3,12
Strattera,"19 yrs Male 175 lb I was diagnosed with ADHD in March, being an engineering major made my psychiatrist skeptical if I actually had ADHD (I do), so he prescribed me Strattera. He told me it was completely safe and had no side effects. I took it daily, for a month straight, and I felt nothing. I  told my psychiatrist this and he increased my dosage to 40 mg. I continued taking my dosage daily and did not notice anything on the first week of my 40 mg dosage. However, I did start developing irrational thoughts. For example, I began thinking everyone hated me, soon after, I started becoming suicidal. I tried killing myself by overdosing on opiates, but my roommate called the ambulance. I stopped taking it, and I started feeling normal again.",1,23
Strattera,"I'm a 18 year old female and I started taking 80mg strattera for ADD and honestly didn't see much to any improvement, I couldn't focus any better than I could before . I became so unmotivated I didn't even want to get out of bed anymore. It calmed me down defiantly and relieved my anxiety 100% but it made me so 'for lack of a better word' depressed. And when I would forget to take it or couldn't get to the pharmacy to refill the prescription for a couple days I would get these massive headaches that hurt so bad I could've cried. Overall I think it just didn't work for me",4,8
Strattera,I'm a 43 y.o. female diagnosed with ADD or ADHD at the age of 30-it's actually the inattentive type if you want to be specific. I kind of knew I had it most of my life because my bro and father had it.  was prescribed ritalin-had energy....but increased my anxiety &amp; insomnia (1-2 yrs)  . Only lasted 4-6 hours but racing thoughts &amp; heart palps at night. Now at 43-I had to ask Dr. repeatedly to prescribe Stratterra-non stimu-helps tremendously w/ anxiety &amp; I can focus somewhat better. Tired in the day but I can complete tasks faster-sleeping much better :) Bonus: I pee less during the day. Took about 1 mo to kick in- side effects: tingling and tiredness. Got used to it.,9,24
Strattera,"I had such high hopes for Strattera, but it was completely ineffective and actually made my condition worse. I wanted it to help me focus on work: sending emails, making phone calls, generally being able to work at a computer and other things. I started at 40mg a day, and found myself slightly more tired. I raised it to 60mg a day and seemed to get more tired and less motivated to get anything done. Finally I went to 80mg and still no help with focus. I just found that I was lethargic, unmotivated and tired. I took naps and lazed around, but didn't get as excited about things as I had before the medicine. My job requires creativity, and it's hard to be creative if you're not excited about it. So I actually became LESS productive.",1,18
Strattera,"I'm a 24 year old female who was prescribed strattera and Ciprolex combined. I have been diagnosed as ADHD and mild depression. I was on Ciprolex for a number of years before strattera and had no side effects but when I started taking Strattera within 2 days I had heart palpitations, dizziness, sleepiness and nausea. I stayed on the medication because I could not focus on even the most basic of tasks so I dealt with these side effects. After a year I started to feel great!! So I weaned myself off and within 2 months I became such an angry, depressed and filled with anxiety over nothing. Anxiety to the point where I thought I was going to be sick. So now I'm stuck dealing with these pills or be worse than before.",2,13
Strattera,"Did nothing for my ADHD. Made me aggressive and easily angered, complete change of personality for the worse.",1,13
Strattera,"My 5 year old daughter has been on 10 mg of Strattera daily for 3 days.  Her first dose was opened and in a prune and Apple sauce mixture....tummy ache in 30 minutes.  The second and third dose were in the capsule and a table spoon of chocolate pudding....she swallowed it and had no tummy pain....we are pleased, so far, and we got a good report from her teacher, today.  I had her say the alphabet tonight and she was more focused and did not mispronounce a single letter.  I am a FNP and WHNP so I have treated a lot of ADHD kids.  Our daughter's Psychiatrist suggested Strattera due to her new diagnosis and young age.  So far she is eating well and fast asleep, beside me.  I hope this continues to be a positive experience.",9,36
Strattera,"My 9 yr old son has verbal dyspraxia, sensory processing disorder and ADHD.   We tried Ritalin which was ok for a year. We didn't give it to him on weekends and school holidays. Then this last term the retalin started causing depression, aggression, mood swings, more headaches and stomach aches. We stopped the Ritalin and saw an improvement, though he was still easily distracted and disrupting the class.  Doctor then said we should try Strattera. From what I had read about it I was not hopeful and expected bad side effect. To my surprise it worked from day one. No side effects. He feels better and happier and is able to listen better so less fights at home and teacher is happy with improvement.",9,38
Strattera,"My 8 year old daughter was prescribed this medication yesterday by our PCP. For the past 6 months she was on Adderrall 10mg and I decreased her to 5mg two months ago. She weighs.64 lbs and 10 mgs of adderrall had her like a zombie, the 5 most recently caused her to become anxious,  overly sensitive,  and literally trichllomania - literally developing the habit of pulling her out. I stopped the adderall this week and her doctor suggested Strattera. I got an email from my daughters teacher after sending her to school on the 1st day of her new meds. My daughter was experiencing super fatigue, headache, and nausea. She was definitely calm, but she could not eat dinner and my baby was so hot to the touch. I will NOT give her any more meds.",1,13
Strattera,"My son who is 6yrs old was put on this medication due to ADHD/anxiety. He was taking 20mg once a day. In the beginning of this medication I felt like I had lost my son, the boy who loved to play, be happy, and active. As week 6 went on when it starts working was awful. My son would have constant negative things to say. Whether it was saying how I didn't love him, or not wanting to do anything because he didn't feel worthy or capable of doing little things. His mood swings had been horrible as well. I recall several evenings, where I would lay with him in bed and rub his back; that before he fell asleep he was saying how he was already having a nightmare. Also, urination...is constant! A 2hr drive consists of at least 3stops!",0,12
Strattera,Caffeine worked better for my ADHD symptoms than Strattera did.,2,11
Strattera,At first I hated it because it didn't give me the energy of Vyvanse and I desperately wanted my Dr. to switch me back. After a couple of weeks I realized that even though I was a little tired and not really focused I was calm and happy. This medication doesn't really do much for my ADD but it eases my anxiety that I always have had. I've tried many other medications and nothing worked for anxiety except for this one. It feels great to be calm and not worried about nonsense. Hope it keeps working for a long time to come.,7,39
Strattera,"I'm a 30 year old male and switched from Dexedrine to Strattera about two years ago. For the first two months I thought it was a terrible decision because of the horrible side effects and talked to my doctor a couple of times about switching back to a stimulant. He told me that even though it says it can take up to a month to start working, in his experience, it took most patients 2-3 months to see the benefits. I'm glad I stuck with it. After four months all side effects we're completely gone and it works better than any stimulant type I've been prescribed. The problem is you do have to get through a horrible period of 1-3 months (10 weeks for me) before the nausea, fatigue, ED and insane sweating are gone. This drug takes time to work!!!",10,59
Strattera,"Works well, does it's job, but be warned, for the first few days - week, the side effects are freaking horrible. I was on Wellbutrin for a half a year, but got off due to having a rare side effect (muscle &amp; joints hurting). Trying Strattera now, and as far as I can tell, it's very nice. Thoughts are organized, and I feel more relaxed (which is good because I might have anxiety - still being determined), none the less I get a lot more things done. Side effects are a bloody nightmare - hang in there! They do go away! I started on only 25MG and for 4 days I was nauseous &amp; had to lay down from time to time, couldn't stop sleeping, &amp; my eyes were hurting... weird... I went up to 50MG, and again, the same symptoms.",9,23
Strattera,"15 year old female with ADHD and mild depression. This sent me into a downwards spiral of suicidal thoughts and erratic behavior. It also caused me to throw up and miss meals due to the 'stuck in my throat' feeling it gave in addition to the burning acid in my throat feeling. Also it gave me headaches so severe I wouldn't even get out of bed.   I give this a 2/10 because although it did help a little, the negative side effects are too much for me.",2,23
Strattera,"Since I've been on strattera I've felt tired &amp; listless -- I can't even work up enough energy for essentials like laundry &amp; dishes. I've been on it for 5 months. My worst side effects are nausea, fatigue, irritability, and strange dreams. It feels like I start dreaming before I even fall asleep and it's driving me crazy. In typical ADHD fashion I forgot my meds at work over the weekend &amp; had to go without -- I woke up at 4am to the worst headache I've ever had. I have an appointment on Wednesday &amp; will be doing my damnedest to get my doc to switch me to a different med. I think it did a little for my ADHD but I also upped my coffee intake while I was on this med.",3,8
Strattera,"My 8 year old son took this, and had an extreme allergic reaction.  I thought it was something else, but on day 5 his eyes swelled and his face broke out.  It took a while to get out of the system. On the other hand, my 11 year old daughter is taking Strattera 25mg, and it has worked great for her.  She is reading like crazy, and she's never been able to focus enough to read.  When ever she took stimulants, she would get a lot of stuff done, but she would be anxious and sad.  This medication is the only one that she's taken that didn't make her sad. I rate it a 5 because it worked terrible for one child, but has been great for the other.",5,21
Strattera,"I was prescribed Strattera for ADD 40 mg. and I was only on it for 6 days. I was warned about the side effect of having nausea and to eat before taking meds in the morning. I started Strattera on a Saturday morning and by that night I had diarrhea so bad that I thought I would have to sleep sitting on the toilet, I also had the feelings of being constantly angry,  I had really bad headaches, depression,  tireness, it worsened my anxiety and any time I would eat I ended up on the toilet for quite a while.  I was put on Strattera to help me with my ADD lack of concentration, etc,  needless to say, it didn't work what so ever. My poor butt thanked me when I quit taking it, hahaha.",1,11
Strattera,"It's maybe my 5th week on the drug, noticed an increase in my productivity and feel like I can get a lot done. Although I'm suffering from nausea and slight headaches, I'm taking other medications so it's hard to say. Tried Ritalin, Ritalin XR and Dex amphetamine also. This isn't as aggressive as Dex, but Dex is my preference in comparison to this. Though it's still early days!",7,9
Strattera,"It works, is all I can say. Started on the sample pack at age 12 (I am 16 now, but will never forget my experience). It worked, I cannot say that it didn't, but it gave me the worst side effects possible. After about a month of the medicine, I was diagnosed with depression as a result of Straterra. When I took it, in probably 2011, the box said, may cause suicidal thoughts or actions, which my physician did not warn me about. Then all of the sudden I was extremely depressed and suicidal and my psychiatrist discovered that Straterra was the cause. He has had several cases before where the mental illness was caused by a drug, and nothing else. Good medicine, just beware of the side effects!",2,13
Strattera,"I've been on Straterra for about two months and am up to 40mgs, with the exception of dry mouth and some manageable stomach aches, the medication seems to work pretty well--and subtly too. I am a very young 48 and I was diagnosed as hyperactive in 1972. I was on Ritalin at a very young age.  While it's NOT a cure, it works much better than stimulant medications as an adult--I read better and seem to not interrupt as much. Coffee effects me quite a bit and if I keep it down that helps too. I was worried about all of the reviews of sexual side effects--I seem to be up and running, this worried me a lot. Once again, I'm not saying Staterra this is a cure all, but my experience seems to be very different than many reviews I have read",7,22
Strattera,Son is making vast improvements in school.  Focus very much improved.  Self confidence increasing.,8,20
Strattera,"I hate this medication. My doctor gave it to me and says to keep taking it in order to feel the effects but I took it a few hours ago, I have the shakes, I get so hot and feel totally out of it. I can't wait til this feeling is over. I will not take it again",1,9
Strattera,"I'm 30 and have taken several types of ADD medications since I was young.  I stopped taking Adderall/Ritalin when I graduated from college (about 25 yrs old) because I did not like the side effect, particularly loss of appetite and jitteriness.  I have since had to get back on meds because I have a sales job and I was making mistakes at work.  I started on 25 mg a couple months back and it worked great at first, but has tapered off some.  I wasn't sure if it was still working, but at night when the morning pill wares off and I can't get anything done and I'm super scatterbrained.  That tells me it is working.  I should probably take the doctor recommend evening dose, as well.  Only complaint on side effects would be extreme sleep spells.",7,13
Strattera,I started taking strattera at 25mg. The first week was crazy I felt like I could do anything. I had so much time on my hands and accomplished so much. I no longer had to fight with myself to wake up. I had so much energy and the foggy feeling was gone. I could focus and what I had to do do it and then move on to the next. It was wonderful. The only side effect I had was insomnia but that went a way after the first week and it was easily resolved with some meditation. After that I started to settle in because I was getting used to it the feelings were dying down. I missed the sense of euphoria the first week had brought but I was still plenty productive and over all my social relationships ad improved. After 3 months I am starting 40mg.,10,34
Strattera,"I was diagnosed with depression/ anxiety after I failed several add medications due to severe constipation.  Recently, l learned about taking probiotics for constipation and tried Strattera again.  Wow, what a difference.  I am much more emotionally stable/focused than I have ever been.  Anxiety disappeared.  Depression is almost unnoticeable.  I'm on Pristiq 50mg for depression/anxiety and two days ago, I upped my dose of Strattera to 60mg.  I was at 40mg for 30 days and I was much more stable emotionally, better focused &amp; functional.  So far, at 60mg, I'm fully focused and no longer feeling slightly tired.  Side effects wise, slow urination is almost gone.  Sexual side effects are moderate and dry mouth is slight. Give it time to work!!!",8,28
Strattera,"within the first week i started getting moderate then severe headaches, that nothing helped (tylenol, advil, aleve, aspirin, natural remedies etc) nothing touched them, and my adhd symptoms persisted  so they made my dose higher and the bigger the dose, the bigger the headache, until i couldn't stand it, and i just stopped taking it after 2 months of severe headaches, and they were so bad i couldnt tell if it worked for attention since i was too distracted by my headaches!  so i was getting distracted either way!  then finally after coming off for a month and being put on intuniv later, no more headaches! and i can actually focus although i don't speak for everyone,  there should really be a warning of severe headaches on the label!!",1,16
Strattera,"I was given a starter pack of a month long supply of Strattera from my Psychiatrist. I'm currently about two weeks in (starts you at 20mg and ends at 80mg) and the reason I am giving the drug this rating is due to me being unsure about how it's affected me thus far. When I first started to take it my anxiety subsided and I felt normal and back on track again. This lasted for the first week. I was even able to travel alone to be with my fiancé in Mexico. I've never traveled much, let alone by myself. I did this with ease. Now back from my trip and having increased the dosage to I believe 60 or 80 right now, I don't feel the same. Sadly. :-( I'm disheartened because I thought this was my cure all after a terrible winter.",6,8
Strattera,"well...... it worked. that's about all I can say.You'll be able to focus, and if you don't mind the fact that the ONLY thing you'll be able to focus on is how tired, nauseated, and occasionally slightly mad you feel, this is the medicine for you. despite that, it's worth nothing that i'm only 17 and ~130 pounds which is really close to the minimum weight on the box. based on what i've seen, it seems to work better for ~30  year olds who aren't underweight. not a professional, obviously, though, so take this with a grain of salt.",2,6
Strattera,Did absolutely nothing.,1,7
Strattera,"15 and diagnosed this year. I have been on it for 4 months (in conjunction with cipralex). Made a massive difference to my concentration levels and sustained energy, I had no idea it was possible to be this productive. Nausea was awful the first week (even threw up once) but faded quickly. I still need to eat alongside it to prevent nausea but since I take it at breakfast time its not a problem. only persistent side effect has been weight loss - abt 7 kgs in past 4 months - mostly due to appetite loss. I was on concerta (ritalin XR) beforehand and the side effects such as heart palpitations and insomnia were awful, also didn't help my adhd symptoms at all. I'd recommend strattera to people who've had bad results with stimulant adhd meds.",10,20
Strattera,"Did not seem to notice much improvement, was on it for probably 8-10 wks.",3,6
Strattera,"I had been on Ritilan for 10 years and found I kept increasingly the dose every year or so. I went on this medication and got so sick. I was very angry and had urges to hurt people I cared about. It felt so weird my hair felt like it was growing tingly feeling. Vision impairment etc, I stopped taking this when I had such strong urges to strangle someone. Very scary. This medication is not for me.",1,18
Strattera,"I am an adult with ADD. I took Strattera according to my doctors recommendations, starting with 25mg and upping the dosage to 80mg gradually for 6 weeks. I noticed nausea almost immediately after I started taking the medicine along with unusual bouts of tiredness. I continued with the plan as I was told some of the initial side effects would ease as my body became accustomed. The side effects began to get worse, with frequent sweats, occasional sore throat, EXTREME tiredness, and the worst constipation I have ever had. I will say that my ability to stay focused was improved dramatically, but the side effects made it impossible to stay on the medicine.",4,14
Strattera,Hated it!!! I was taking adderall for a year and it started making me feel anxious maybe one day a week. I was switched to this and once I started it my anxiety got really bad. I've never had a problem with anxiety and I really feel for the people that suffer from chronic anxiety! I also had a problem with dropping blood pressure (could be from adderall withdraw tho) I also had HORRIBLE mood swings. As soon as I would take it I was very negative about everything. I'm so glad to be off it now and so is my boyfriend!!,1,13
Strattera,"  Comprehension: Before:  If you wanted me to pay attention, understand something, or even acknowledge it, you would often have to repeat it several times.  I would misread or misunderstand things more than the average person.  After:  I understand most communication right away, including the emotions and attitude of the other person, which were often not even on my radar before.    Interpersonal Communication: Before:  I was very likely to interrupt others.  I wouldn't wait for others to speak before continuing my conversation.  I came across as very harsh &amp; critical. After:  I'm better at engaging in appropriate give-and-take in conversation.  I communicate in a much appropriate friendly tone. Dealing with adversity: Before: Even trivial matters would provoke a negative reaction, ruin my mood or trigger impulsive/disruptive behavior. Id get down on myself for minor mistakes After: Even when things dont go the way I like them to go, I handle things in a much more mature, measured way. When something goes wrong, Im more likely to laugh it off than I used to. Im more even keeled, less likely to fly off the handle.",8,64
Strattera,I couldn't handle the side affects. Night sweats with intense anxiety and nausea. Couldn't sleep. Terrible. Only lasted 2 weeks.,3,15
Strattera,"This drug does help me calm down and focus (it also really helped me with my anxiety) but the side effects of vomiting, feeling like I don't care about the world and my head is squished in, and ultimately my inability to stay awake throughout the day left me asking my doctor for a change of medication. For reference, this was my first medication used to manage my adult ADHD and I started on one pill for three days and was moved up to two and these side effects worsened with two pills.",4,20
Strattera,"Worst treatment I've tried, may even exacerbate ADHD symptoms. Causes depression, fatigue and anxiety without even working to improve concentration. Don't even feel or act like myself since I started this med. People even know something is wrong when they talk to me. Trying to stop/change treatment, but Doctor only wants to keep me on this med until college semester is over. Have tried Concerta before, worked somewhat.",1,17
Strattera,"Diagnosed with having ADHD in my early 20's. Dr. wanted me to try out Strattera before a stimulant since I also have anxiety and he feared a med like Adderrall would make it worst.  This is my second month on it and it does seem to be working. I am better able to concentrate and my head seems more clear. I'm on 80mg.  Stomach-aches and drowsiness started off horrible when I first began taking this med but these side effects are almost gone. Still get dry mouth which ranges from mild to it feels like I've eaten cotton and sand. Unless the side effects are too intense for you, I would at least give this med two months. Think it gets such a bad rep because people don't give it a chance.",7,63
Strattera,"In my 30's, energy levels dropped and  found life more challenging.  I would wonder how I could get through the day.   I took adderall  but could feel that it wasn't right.  I guess it felt too much of a party drug.  After a few doses, I actually just felt, I suppose buzzed, not able to complete tasks.  Perhaps the dose wasn't high enough?  I went to my doctor with a list of meds. and notes.  He picked up on straterra, which wasn't top.  The instructions said it may take a month to work! It was instant!  I am less irritable, have more mental energy.  My brain must have been tired and my thoughts are more positive than negative.  I have all the side effects, inconsistently.  They are far outweighed by ++.  Also try matcha green tea!!",9,46
Strattera,"Made me feel totally disconnected from social interaction,life,etc. its like it closed my head in.",1,20
Strattera,"45 year old woman, 138lbs 5'7. Started at 25mg and titrated slowly. Noticed within a week my stress responses improved. Continued to increase as no change to organisation, memory or attention. Felt ok even at 100mg. Then since I started 120mg, I feel quite unwell. I don't think I'm unable to sustain this dose as side effects are strong: nausea after 1hr of ingestion, tiredness, feeling as though I've had too much strong coffee. The S/E definitely more pronounced if I'm not doing anything so I try and stay active and never take this on an empty stomach!  I'll give it 2 more weeks at 120mg (which will be 6 weeks total) then gently titrate down. It gives me palpitations, too, which make me unhappy.  I get this free on NHS in UK.",5,12
Strattera,"I had bad reaction from Ritalin so I was given Strattera. Strattera gave me and still gives me a nauseous feeling, I always take it with food and after driving to avoid this side effect as much as possible. At times it gives me head aches and irritability due to me feeling off. It is very effective in controlling my hyperactivity. I am much more attentive. Its benefits out weigh its current side effects, I recommend talking to your doctor and to keep trying new medicines to find out what works best for you. I gave it a 6/10. Its expensive, $140ish",6,11
Strattera,"36 year old female diagnosed last year. I did not want medication, but fearing I'd lose my job from symptoms, talked to my doctor and gave Strattera a try. Been on it a month. Can see major improvements in concentration, getting things done, not jumping from one thing to another constantly. I'm also a calmer, less anxious version of myself, more patient mother. Things don't seem to bother me as much! My head is quiet. For side effects the first 2 days were bad - chills, tingling/current sensation on my scalp, upper back and neck and numb arms, drowsy. My doctor told me not to quit, so glad I did! No constipation or trouble urinating. Still get occasional chills and scalp tingling, low appetite (good cause I was overeating!). Hope it lasts!",9,35
Strattera,My son five has ADHD and anxiety and still further diagnosing. He was on it for a month and half and he was so awesome on it. Dr did 40 mg a day and love how it works throughout whole day. Unfortantly insurance did not want to approve before age six and it cost over 370 dollars. I've gone through way too many medicines with him. Once he turns six you best to believe we are going right back to it!,9,23
Strattera,"I'm ADD and Bipolar.  Strattera has helped give me a laser like focus in the morning.  If I don't get enough sleep I can't stay awake (it seems to cause drowsiness) but if I am well rested, I am on task.  The only negative is as the day wears on, it seems to lose effectiveness.  I could use another dose by 3pm.  I am thirsty all the time, dry mouth and not very hungry. I'm on my 2nd month and seeing how it goes. I've tried Adderall that made me way too nervous and Effexor which didn't do enough.",9,23
Strattera,"This medicine was awful for me. I felt nauseous taking it, moodiness and had a hard time staying awake after 3-4 hours. I also had a hard time driving during that time too. Do not like it",1,19
Strattera,"Gums started hurting 2nd day 3rd day unbearable and face started to swell  had to lie down as dizzy , violently sick, pins and needles in hand , very unhappy tooth ache  I as trying to tolerate as got told takes time to work but I was in to much pain so phoned Dr who told me to stop taking it, I never want to take this drug ever again I feel very unwell. No help at all to my AHHD just feel completely Unwell",1,23
Strattera,"I just started taking Strattera a little less than two weeks ago. I was taking Adderall for two years but my doctor took me off it because he was concerned that I suddenly began losing weight rapidly. I haven't noticed many side effects from Strattera but I have been a little more tired than usual. I still haven't seen any increase in my ability to focus but it seems like it could take up to a month or so for the full effect. However, I also have epilepsy which might possibly make my experience with it much different than others. Here's to hoping it works out!",0,5
Strattera,"I have been on Strattera for 5 weeks now. I'm 48 years old and have been treated for bipolar and anxiety  disorders from the age 19, have tried dozens of med combinations and have been hospitalized a few times when unable to cope. This last time a therapist suggested it may be ADHD and doctor put me on 40mg... its a night and day difference. I have never in my life had this kind of clarity and focus and other then dry mouth and a bit of a lost appetite side effect which is much better then past combinations.",10,85
Strattera,"My son, now 10, was diagnosed with impulse control issues. He has always had As and Bs in school and always loves to read. He gets bored alot in class and his impulse control (blurting out, saying what's on his mind/no filter) had caused him to be put in alternative school (where his grades began to falter). Over the summer, we had him evaluated and they said that meds would help. Our general physician didn't want to put him on a stimulant and suggested Straterra. First 2 months @ 60mg. Lost 15lbs (which put him at the right weight actually) and slept all the time. Backed off to 40mg since then and he's maintained his weight, sleeps well and maintained grades. Too bad our monthly script cost increased x9. Looking for a cheaper alternative.",8,41
Strattera,"I started with a low dose and then took the highest dose. I noticed nothing for the first two months and then I felt suicidal, derpressed and it did nothing for my ADHD. It was costly even with insurance and I had to stop taking it. Now I'm stuck with my ADHD and never have I felt worse than I did on this medication. It messes with your mind.",1,41
Strattera,"It's the only ADD med that actually works for me. The higher the dose the clearer I think (male 5'11 185). However, if my dose is over 40mg (I've taken as much as a 100mg) then I get erectile dysfunction, penis shrinkage and dry mouth. Once I lowered my dose to 40mg I stopped concentrating as good but the side effects went away too.",8,26
Strattera,"40 yr old male newly diagnosed first time to take ADD meds. Small dose definitely gave focus, but mind was racing at night. Bad sleep, woke up many times, clock seems to tick very slow. Noticeable side effects included:  decreased urine flow, ED, shrinkage and semen leakage prior to climax. Got up to 40mg and quit.",2,28
Strattera,"(18 years old, 104lbs, 5'0) I was on 25 mg and switched to 40mg as I hadn't noticed anything after a month. So far I have dry mouth sometimes, feel more tired, nausea after taking pill. Also, those around had noticed that I am blah all the time after I take it and that I completely change from my upbeat personality to very flat. I will be talking to my doctor about taking a stimulant instead so I won't have to take it everyday.",6,28
Strattera,"I am on a trial pack starting from 25 mg with an increases of 15 - 20 mg a week. I am at my second week at 40mg and so for all I feel is the side effects. I found that if I take it on an empty stomach I get extremely nauseous for about and hour or two. I can't really tell if it's working yet since I'm only in my second week, but so far I'm not too optimistic. I was on Wellbutrin before and that had little to no effect on me. I don't feel depressed at all but I will say my anxiety has diminished. As for the ADD I guess will just have to wait and see.",4,17
Strattera,"I'm only on day 1 with 40mg dose, but I noticed the front of my brain hurts and I'm endlessly thirsty. Getting up and sitting down has made me a little dizzy also. Hope it gets better with time or I'll ask doc for a change of meds.",3,15
Strattera,"I had taken Adderall, Concerta and other ADHD medications which all caused me to lose my appetite, get moody or come down from it and I felt I wasn't able to be myself. Strattera took a few weeks to kick in, I fell asleep constantly for the first two-four weeks (I know lots of people jump the Strattera ship then saying it is not working or making them sleepy) but after 4 weeks I started to feel like myself again. Except my mind got clearer, I could organize my room/now apartment, do all my school work, do everything I need to do, have better conversations and do not binge eat. I take 40mg and have had no side effects from it. It also helps my anxiety. It is my miracle.",10,185
Strattera,"I started taking Strattera a few weeks ago for ADD. I have noticed it makes me really calm compared to my usual ways. It helps me focus a little better than I used to but I am still not really focused during class. I take 80mg a day, yes I know that's a lot but that's what was prescribed for me. I have completely lost my appetite. Some days go by and I realize I haven't eaten anything. I have lost 10 lbs. Other than that it just gives me a really dry mouth. I always take over the counter sleep aids so I always sleep fine. I wonder if I should try Adderall? Concerta I have already tried and did not like it.",6,25
Strattera,I had been on Strattera for 8 years. It did great but within last year things seemed to change. I thought it wasn't working due to my memory and concentration but now being off for about a month realize it was doing a lot. I am now having headaches lack of motivation loosing temper easily etc. My family and friends see a significant change in my behavior. (Negative change). Concentration and focus have always been an issue on and off medicine so I just have to work harder with it. Also realize it takes more than this medicine to really have success.,7,58

Strattera,Strattera helped my ADD very little and suppressed my appetite and I lost all ability to sleep even though I was always tired.,4,31
Strattera,"This is the start of my 3rd day in this medications. I am in 25mg once a day. So far I notice it makes me a little sleepy, dry mouth and gives tingle sensation on my head.

AGE: 21, 110lbs, F",6,56
Strattera,"I am a female, age 21, weight: 110. First day taking it I experienced: dry mouth, fatigue, head tingles and no sign of concentration benefits yet. I know that it's supposed to start to work after a few days. Definite appetite suppressant but I still ate meals. You feel as if you know when it's wearing off. I'll keep updating as the days go by.",0,33
Strattera,"My son, 11,  was taking Strattera and it did not work out well for him.  His ADHA is rather mild, and I thought this could help him with a few of his struggles. However, the side effects outweighed the benefits. The most extreme side effect didn't really hit until about a month into taking Strattera.  He became very emotional, would lash out disrespectfully and within 5 minutes would be crying and saying how sorry he was.  His brain clarity actually was WORSE.  He has always been a honor student and suddenly couldn't remember his multiplication facts. Last side effect was his appetite was suppressed.  He has been off the medication for 5 days and I have my kid back.",2,73
Strattera,"Nothing would quite fix me. Not antidepressants, or therapy or Adderall.  Depressed all the time, screaming on the inside.  Had days I literally could not do anything. Unfocused at work, hated my job, life and wife.  Changed psych doctors, prescribed Strattera, titrated more slowly than sample pack, got up to 60 mg. Way happier. Less sensitive - don't get hurt easily. Take criticism better. Wife notices big difference in mood- always thought it was depression.  It's ADD and Strattera is perfect for it.  Just hope it keeps working!",9,205
Strattera,So far so good. Been taking about a week now &amp; no noticeable side effects. Had to quit Adderall due to symptoms in re my heart. I have High Blood Pressure &amp; ended up in ER for a myriad of strange &amp; scary heart-related issues. PCP wanted me off Adderall since it's a stimulant &amp; suggested Strattera as it is a SNRI. I take a SSRI for depression without incident so with this new one I guess time will tell.,8,29
Strattera,"Everybody has a different chemical composition, what works for you may not work for others. For me this was legit mind and focus booster. I would be unemployed if it wasn't for this.",10,153
Strattera,I would feel focused but always tired and the worst stomach pain for me personally.,5,43
Strattera,"I have an 8 yr old son who has ADHD. He has tried several medications including Adderall and Vyvanse. Nothing has worked as well as Strattera for him. He's a new kid. So much happier. He used to have severe mood swings with the Vyvanse, although it did control his ADHD fairly well for about 5-6 hrs after he took it. Strattera has been a big help regaining some normalcy in his life. He is only on 10 mg daily for the last 3-4 weeks but it has made a very noticeable difference. I have not seen any negative side effects from it, and he is actually eating on it. Thank you Strattera.",7,114
Strattera,"I was 20 when I started staking Strattera. As far as focusing yes, I was completely focused and motivated all day! If I was sitting still I would have to pull out my phone and play a game to keep my mind moving. However the side effects were absolutely terrible! I was constantly sweating and if I wasn't sweating I had chills! I began suffering from insomnia. I have constant dry mouth and headaches. The worst side effect by far was what it did to my menstrual cycle. It gave me a EXTREMELY heavy and very crampy cycle. It also made my very regular cycle completely irregular. The side effects made it not worth it at all.",3,56
Strattera,"The side effects were terrible. The first day my heart was racing so fast, I had dry mouth, headache, chills, sweating, and woke up every hour after falling asleep at 10pm. I usually sleep through the night. The 2nd day of taking Strattera my eyes were dilated and my husband said my eyes looked weird. I thought I would sleep better since I took the medicine in the morning but I was wrong. Fell asleep at 10pm, woke up sweating with a fast pulse...really fast. Woke up every 2 hours. Just terrible. The 2 days I took it I had energy to do tasks around the house but the side effects of not sleeping and my eyes dilating were too much. Plus my heart rate was all over the place.",3,40
Strattera,"I wanted to do an updated review on this medication. I am in my 9th month of taking it, and, before Obama Care I ran out a few times, and the effects were very noticeable. Even though it is not supposed to have classic SSRI withdrawal symptoms, I still had severe brain zaps. I have my script filled and I am back on it. I am such a better worker, listener and planner on this medication. I am a better version of myself. Love it! I take 40mg a day, 60mg was too much.  I am 160lbs tall female 34 yo.",10,135
Strattera,I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 9. I'm now 22. I've been on many medications for it. My favorite would have to be Adderall because it works now. Strattera is time release and it takes weeks to actually notice a difference. If you have patience for it then I'd recommend it.,7,55
Strattera,"Straterra is changing my life. I held out for 4 months with the side effects and now the improvements are extremely significant. My memory is better and I can get myself easier into a concentration mode. Although it does not fight all symptoms, it enables you to start taking action against it, if that makes sense.",8,96
Strattera,"I have been on Strattera for 4 months. I still find myself procrastinating a lot. I never eat, I lost 7 pounds the first week I was on it. Doctor then gave me Adderal. I find it way better except the fact it keeps you up all night.",3,29

Strattera,"I am 15 years old girl and this was the first medication I ever took for my ADD and I don't even know if it worked for my ADD symptoms. But I do know the side effects of Strattera were all I had. I was depressed, numb, sleepy, could not eat and had anxiety. It felt like I wasn't on earth I was out in space numb to the world.",1,67
Strattera,Took this since 3rd grade. It made me tried and I became depressed. After getting off the pills I became myself again. I took it from 3rd grade till about 8th grade. I'm now in 10th grade with no ADHD meds at all.,3,44
Strattera,"I am pretty much in love with Strattera. I am a 19 year old female and was diagnosed with ADD around 8 months ago. The difference between my life on and off Strattera is huge. When I'm on it, I am so motivated and focused. I have a plan for every day of my life and, though I don't always get everything done on my list for the day, I at least try to be productive and I at least care about getting things done. When I'm not on it, I am a complete blob. I care very little about being productive and have issues even getting out of bed. Like, I will literally stay in bed ALL DAY. The only persistent side effect that I've experienced is dry mouth. If I miss a dosage and then take it again, I get super drowsy, but that goes away after a day.",9,125
Strattera,"As an adult living ADHD, I had no idea how it affected me. I was prescribed this by a psychiatrist, and almost immediately I was able to think more clearly, my memory felt better, I felt like I could concentrate on things.

Strattera,"My son was diagnosed with Autism, however he has symptoms of ADHD but is not. The ADHD meds. just made things worse for him so the Dr. gave me Strattera to try 10mg and it helped, I kept wondering why he could take this but not other ADHD meds. his pediatrician told me it is an antidepressant that was discovered to have a calming effect, and if it makes him tired take it at bedtime. It is very expensive but helps we have not been able to increase the dose, but kids on the spectrum are difficult to medicate.",7,54
Strattera,"This medication was not a good match for me. I was dizzy, nauseous and sleepy. I had to move very slowly in order not to make side effects worse. I only took one 45mg dose. I was given a verbal list of possible side effects from the pharmacist. I tried to keep an open mind as everyone may not experience negative side effects but in this case I did. I am an adult with ADD so I was prescribed this to help symptoms of inattention. The side effects lasted 24 hrs.",1,42
Strattera,Makes me super depressed unmotivated and unable to enjoy anything. Does increase attention span at the cost of not wanting to do anything.,1,61
Strattera,It made me want to sleep all day and made me extremely nauseated. After a month of taking 40mg it didn't touch my ADHD and after a month of 60mg still nothing happened except the side effects.,1,40
Strattera,"I used Strattera for adult ADHD after I auto-diagnose and then was corroborated by my doctor. It helped me stay focused on any tasks I started to completion. I took it for more than a year but had to stop because was too expensive for me even with insurance. I had some side effects that I mentioned to the company Lilly. These side effects were slight dizziness, nausea if taken without food, hair on the back of my neck would raise sensation, and some stomach discomfort, but the worst was the size of my penis would decrease incredibly while flaccid (normally 3 inches, but after medication, about 1 inch or less) and would take a lot of stimulation to get an erection.",9,49
Strattera,"Well, it only took 33 years for me (and a good doctor), to figure out what was wrong with me. I have had unexplained tachycardia (did EKGs and no problems, although never during an episode) since about age 8-9, I've had episodes of fainting, syncope, almost fainting, fatigue, being hyper and crashing. ADD symptoms, depression, mania. I have been treated for Depression and Mania, 3 years ago, and came oh so close to a solution, but the wrong meds made it even worse. Took 2 years to recover. Until, I got a new doctor, who treated my ADD and after two failed attempts to tolerate Adderall and Ritalin, prescribed Straterra, in the first 40 minutes I tool 25mg, my ADD symptoms subsided, and ALL other symptoms have resolved.",10,87
Strattera,"I am 32 &amp; have walked around with ADHD for my entire life until a nurse suggested I get screened. My Doc told me I was Cyclothymic (Bipolar III) &amp; that I was having panic attacks. I agreed but the symptoms never got better with the prescription I was on.  I went to have my Echocardiogram &amp; was told I gave Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. Long story short, the benefits of this medicine have shown up in the 7 days that I have taken it. My pulse is lower, I haven't had any panic attacks &amp; I'm starting to be able to focus a little better. I can't urinate as well unless I consume more water but I needed more anyway.  This medicine has made me feel normal for the first time in many many years.",8,89
Strattera,"My husband has ADD, and it really took a toll on our relationship.  He was originally on Vyvanse, but it suppressed his appetite horribly.  It didn't do enough in ratio to the side effects, so he decided to try Strattera. So far, it's been working decently.  His main problem, however, is being able to urinate freely.  I bought him Urinozinc Prostate Formula, and literally the first pill he took, he was able to urinate much more easily.  Conversely, when he forgot a pill the other day, he noticed an immediate difference, and struggled to urinate.  The supplement has allowed him to stay on Strattera. I note this stuff, as I have read that this is a common issue for men taking Strattera.  Hope this helps others.",7,60
Strattera,"I was given Strattera to treat my ADD. I began taking it with a free packet that ranged from 20mg to 80mg. At about 40 mg I began to notice that I was able to concentrate better in school. When I got to 80mg I began to not daydream anymore and people found it easier to talk to me because I wouldn't be constantly jumping from subject to subject. My anxiety and sleep problem was also solved. However, after forgetting to take it one day, I got a massive headache, equal to a migraine. Besides that, I have had no other issues and it has made life much calmer and it has made my grades improve alot.",9,102
Strattera,"I've been on Strattera for a month and am currently taking 60mg a day for ADHD and anxiety. I'm also taking Lexapro and Buspar. So far, I've experienced no side effects and this has been almost a miracle. My anxiety is almost gone, I am able to think more clearly and concentrate on work and other obligations. I'm much less impulsive than before taking Strattera and I tend to think things through before acting.  My only complaint is the cost. My insurance doesn't cover my medicine.",8,54
Strattera,I would have only good things to say about Strattera if I could have got pass the constipation that started after week three.,9,20
Strattera,I am a 25 yr old female with ADHD And bipolar disorder. My doctor started me on Strattera a little over a month ago and it works great. I was having a hard time constraining in class (I'm a college student) and it really helps me focus. The only down side is the occasional nausea but I found if I take it on an empty stomach the nausea isn't so bad. I would suggest this medicine.,10,44
Strattera,"My son 13 has Strattera for almost a year.  Starting from 10mg for a month, 20 mg for a month, 30 mg for 3 months,  40mg for 6 months then 50mg for now.  The only side effect is dry mouth.  Everything else is good, he can make friends and focus in class.  However, I still think Strattera is not a magic pill.  Combining both medication and behaviour modification works best for our ADHD children.   Lots of love and acceptance are the best remedy,",8,98
Strattera,"This medicine helps...it is not a cure-all. My biggest side effect is I CAN'T SLEEP...Thankfully this passes after a few weeks. Overall, I have found this medicine to be helpful.",8,49
Strattera,"My son went on Strattera... came off after about 6 months because he found it terrible and was causing him pain, discomfort (mentally) and he was constantly crying, hurting himself and even one time fainted.",1,43
Strattera,"My son is 15 now and we have struggled for years with his ADHD. He has now been on Strattera for 2 years and has gone from straight D's in maths to A in achievement he can concentrate more retain information and does not lose it as he uses to. I have seen no side effects at all. At one point he went off it, lasted 5 days then chose to go back on it as he could tell that it helped his behaviour and way of dealing with things. I have only good things to say about Strattera.",10,107
Strattera,"I was on this for ADHD and while I did see a noticeable improvement in my ability to concentrate and not be running around acting all hyper, it worked a little too well if you know what I mean. I had a heck of a time getting ready for school and I'd fall asleep on the bus ride there (I was in high school at the time). I also couldn't keep my head up in first period and would constantly snap awake at loud sounds or giggles in the classroom, not realizing I'd even fallen asleep. It wouldn't wear off until second or third period, so mornings were awful. I would be so zombie-like and sleepy no matter how much rest I got the night before. Eventually I quit taking it because I didn't like feeling like a walking corpse in the mornings.",7,52
Strattera,I began Strattera two days ago and the first day I had problems urinating immediately. I also noticed problems holding an erection. Day two was even worse as I could hardly urinate and when I got sexually exited I could not have an erection at all. I have never had sexual problems before and urinating has always been normal. I blame Strattera because it's the only new medication I was taking. I also take Lithium for depression and Prozac for my sexual addiction.,1,36
Strattera,"I definitely noticed a difference while taking Strattera. The symptoms of my ADHD have improved indefinitely. I feel less withdrawn from reality, increased self esteem and better focus. The 25mgs gave me insomnia. With the 40mg I stopped noticing the benefits of Strattera and noticed more of the side effects (dizziness, hot flashes, etc). 60mg seemed to be the most effective for me. But after a week of taking the 60mg, I didn't go a day without nausea. The nausea was so bad that it practically cancelled out the benefits of Strattera. This is just what happened in my case. I would recommend this medication in hopes that the side effects aren't as bad for others.",7,50
Strattera,I took it for ADD. Too many side effects. Discontinued after 13 days.,5,29
Strattera,"Took it for a month. It caused a great deal of anxiety, sweating, and nausea.",1,37
Strattera,"I love Strattera! I'm a 31 year old woman with ADHD that has gone untreated my whole life. I finally got tested and diagnosed with ADHD, and after doing lots of research decided to try Strattera. This is the first and only thing I've tried for ADHD and I love it. I've been taking 40mg for two months and I've noticed a significant improvement in my ability to focus on and complete tasks without feeling distracted. It has calmed me down and I don't feel as edgy and agitated anymore. I'm able to control my emotions more and feel happier and more at ease. So glad I moved forward with this!",10,148
Strattera,I have been on Strattera  for 6 years. I take one 18mg a day. When I take it I don't feel like myself. I feel depressed. I feel tried all the time. So for me I don't like it but so far they haven't found anything else that will work  for me.,3,19
Strattera,"I'm a 47 year old female.  Dr. gave me the free packet that works up from 20mg to 80mg.  Took it for only about 3 weeks and then quit.  Did not notice any help with ADHD, although I may not have given it long enough.  However, the side effects were: increase in blood pressure, feeling my heart beating hard, sleepiness, getting winded very quickly from just walking less than a block.  This medicine is not for me.  Even though it is not a stimulant, it seemed to affect my cardiovascular system, and the symptoms were just not worth it.",3,35
Strattera,I have been on Straterra for about two months.  It certainly has a subtle affect that creeps up on you. It is not a stimulant so does not have that quick hit affect.  While taking it I feel a little dopey... but if I have been on it for a while and then lower the dose to one every two days. I can really feel the difference in my performance and focus. I went through a stressful experience which brought on some mania.  Stay off this medicine if you go through a similar experience.  It heightens panic and intensifies anxiety. Other then that seems to be good.,6,26
Strattera,"Bad experience. Week one- headaches. Week two-agitation. Week three- severe agitation, nausea and light-headedness, feeling slightly suicidal. My doctor prescribed this to help me focus and I thought symptoms would subside.",0,25
Strattera,"I'm in my mid 20's and bipolar. I was put on this to treat ADHD since I've always struggled in school and I'm completely unorganized. The first day I took it, it put me to sleep. After a few days of sleeping a lot I could focus! The only bad thing was when I worked out I would get funny vision, like I was going to pass out. Which doesn't help since I'm a fitness professional. I think the lower dosage worked better, once I went up to 60  I couldn't focus, slept all the time, felt depressed, and the vision got worse. I gave this medicine 8 weeks just to see if the side effects would dissipate and sadly it didn't. I did lose a few pounds, but nothing drastic (a loss of 3lbs.. I'm female 53 and 105).",5,26
Strattera,"For the first night in I can't tell you how long, I am processing one thought at a time. I am calm instead of frienzied. My normal 20 thoughts all playing at the same time are gone and I'm not sure what to do with the calm. This may take a few days to adjust, but I am at peace right now that has been sorely lacking.",8,83
Strattera,"I am a 37yr woman diagnosed with ADHD. 1st try with Ritalin made me feel overwhelmed, sad, uncontrollable spurts of crying for no reason, tired. Dr. switched me to Straterra. It's only my fist week, but had to share. Ok, 1st the bad: mild headache, SUPER DRY mouth, hot and sweaty, weird tingly sensation that comes in waves. Feels like my hair on my arms and head is crawling and tingly and cool for a few seconds and goes away. Clenching my jaw. No noticable improvement with racing thoughts or concentration as of yet. Now the good: This pill should be called Lady Viagra, lol! That cool, tingly, hair crawling sensation is AMAZING when being intimate. Everything is more intense and indescribably WONDERFUL...and I have been married 10yrs!",5,43
Strattera,"My son is 11 and started using Strattera about a week ago after Ritalin was showing some minor side effects.  He is currently waking up at night and claiming he can't sleep - this happened every night he took Strattera.  We stopped taking it after 4 days because mom was paranoid after reading all the side effects.  I didn't connect the insomnia with the medication at 1st but decided to carry on with Strattera after a talk with Pediatrician - suddenly, he's again struggling to sleep at night.  We decided take it in the evenings now - tonight was the first  - we'll see what happens tonight.  I am really not sure about this medicine.  Wish there was something natural that he could rather take to help with his concentration, etc.",0,22
Strattera,"37 female with fresh diagnosed ADHD. Doc let me tried this 1 month sttratter. See clear improvement from 2 wks at 40mg/d. I almost want to cry when I finish reading one scientific article  in 1 hour... Mental work is no longer painful. I think, I write, my brain is used to it's potential at last. Cons: constipation, dry mouth, nausea, low appetite, stranger sensation on scalp, easy to get angry, expensive, distance. But now MY life is priceless---knowing you could try your best.",0,66
Strattera,"We used this medication after stimulants didn't work for my 9yr old with quite severe ADHD.  He also has high functioning autism. This medication did have some positive effects - it helps calm him and is therefore more reasonable and able to focus.  Others immediately noticed a difference in him.  We certainly notice a difference to when he doesn't take his meds. However, over the last 8mths or so we have noticed quite a significant increase in suicidal behaviour. It was only after a recent report about strattera that we made the link.   So this HAS worked, but unfortunately we are stopping due to high suicide ideation.",0,35
Strattera,My son only started Strattera this week.  The first day his stomach was upset.  Then we started taking it at night.  It was mush better.  I dont know if it is going to work but he says that he is feeling better already.,8,24
Strattera,"I have been on Strattera for over a year now.  I will be 50 in July. This medicine works well for me.  My thought patterns were like a slot machine with three or more thoughts going through my head at one time.  Now my brain is quiet. It's amazing. I sleep well because I can turn off my thoughts. I have lost over 50 lbs. due to side effects at first, but now it's because I find that I focus on what I put in my mouth. It is nice to be able to wear skinny clothes again. I only need to lose about 30 more. Try this medication. I can't imagine not ever taking it. It has been a blessing.",10,128
Strattera,"I have been in treatment for ADD for 15 years. As a result I have tried and used several of the standard drugs used for treatment including Adderall, Ritalin, Dexadrine, and Wellbutrin.  About 3 years ago I began using Strattera. I was made aware that the medicine did not affect the dopamine levels but should still help prolong my attention time. Since then I have found this to be true. However, the difficulty is since the impact it is seemingly subtle. It's very difficult to gauge the effectiveness and to determine the proper dosage.  After 2 years, my doctor and I are still tweeking this aspect.  Overall, Strattera has worked to allow me to still have something for my family left after a long day work.",7,37
Strattera,"I started taking Strattera in 8th grade when I had a low C in Maths. I haven't had anything under a B since and I am now a freshman in college. It definitely worked for me, helps me focus. When I don't take it I do notice a difference in how I'm feeling. I would recommend not taking it before bed, whenever I do I have nightmares and have trouble staying asleep.",9,38
Strattera,"Can't tolerate stimulants, so only choice was non-stimulant medication.  It does work, and I've definitely noticed a difference.  First couple of days I'd get real sick for a couple of hours, pretty nauseated.  But that went away after a while.  For the first two months, I rarely felt hungry, I dropped 15 pounds, but my mouth was always dry, and I was drinking liters upon liters of water every day.  Still some problems downstairs, if you know what I mean.  Makes me pretty sleepy, so I usually take it right before I turn in for the day.  But honestly, even with all the side effects, it works well enough that I do continue to take it.",7,28
Strattera,"Eighteen year old female, just started taking Strattera on Thanksgiving.  Slept through the entire day and night, had lucid dreams, woke up angry and crying.  I tried it a second day, Friday, and managed to stay awake (more due to the fact that I was reading a good book).  I refused to take it on Saturday because I was visiting family and I didn't want to be moody or drowsy around people that I get to see maybe twice a year.  Took it again this morning, barely managed to finish a short story before falling asleep in the car, which I have NEVER done before.  Still feeling the effects of it right now, got yelled at for falling asleep, still moody, still have homework to do.  I'll check back in a few days after school.",1,15
Strattera,"28 years old, 165 pounds. Severe paranoia from stimulants and Wellbutrin; caffeine as well. Nowhere else to turn, I started on Straterra 10mg, twice a day. Effects in first 2 hours. Felt manic-ish. Sleep pattern disrupted. Cola colored urine stains on the toilet bowl when not flushed. Smoking desire enhanced.  2 weeks later. same dosage. Very focused. Used together occasionally with an anti-psychotic and anti-anxiety for when any panic attacks, manicness, or paranoia begins to occur.  Studying time increased. Comprehension enhanced. Distractions minimized. Recommend this medicine at 10mg for those with side effects from stimulants.",9,25
Strattera,My son is 9 years and  we just found out that he has ADHD but since he has been on his medicines he's been really good at  school.,10,19
Strattera,My doctor tried to put me on this. It gave me heartburn and a bad headache. I was not able to control bowel movements either. Sometimes I would actually stain the back of my pants. One good thing is I had an erection for hours. It did make me lose 40 pounds the first month I was on it though.,1,8
Strattera,"My 7 year old son with Autism/ADHD took this to decrease impulsivity. He got insomnia, rages/aggression, completely out of control. It would happen about 4 hours after taking 25mg. It also interferes with his asthma medicines- Albuterol. Not for us.",2,19
Strattera,"I took my 1st 10mg, I ate 1/2 peanut butter sandwich with banana and cup of coffee, within hour and half I was nauseous and gagged. I had hot flashes throughout morning. I felt better by late afternoon, I lay in bed all night long beginning at 9pm trying to fall asleep, I may have a total of two hours. It is time to get ready for work and I am exhausted, I have to eat breakfast and start all over again- I am sure I can endure these beginning effects but plan on calling Doctor.",5,7
Strattera,"I have been on Strattera for almost a year. This is the only ADD medicine I have tried so I do not have experience with others. It helps me focus in on one thing and gives my brain a rest from all the thoughts. It also helps me sleep at night because my mind is not wandering.  Some side effects I have experienced is weight loss (almost extreme from 120 to 100 in 5 months) although I have gained about 5 pounds back and am still working on it.  Also I am very thirsty all the time, so keep water with you everywhere! . Lastly I have to take it on a full stomach or else it will give me a severe stomach ache. Overall, this medicine has really helped me be able to enjoy life and want to spend time with the people I love!",9,57
Strattera,"I've tried Concerta alone, Strattera alone, Strattera with Wellbutrin, and am now taking Concerta 36 and Strattera 40 together.  They have different effects, and I don't want to be without either one.  Concerta works great for staying on target when I'm at work.  Strattera works great at lowering irritation and provokability.  Much slower to anger with the Strattera, able to brush off insults, has helped with marital problems.  Strattera also makes me interested in my daughter and wife, improves my patience in reading a book, and reduces my urge for internet browsing.   I had the often reported sexual side effects (leaking semen, painful ejaculation) at the 60 dose, so reduced to 40.",8,21
Strattera,"The negative side effects were too much to deal with. I couldn't handle the IRRITABILITY, agitation, depression, decreased libido and penis size, constipation, chemical odor in my excessive sweating. I couldn't remain in a deep sleep at night, feelings of helplessness and insecurities only when using Strattera. Sadness and I can understand how suicidal thoughts tend to develop on this medication. There was a slight increase in my concentration. After discontinuing abruptly the most intense nightmares and sleepless nights followed. Good luck, I hope you're one of the fortunate ones that this medication worked for. I am a 30 yr old male.",2,13
Strattera,"I have been on it a few months, with great results for my ADD. I have greater concentration and am up getting things done, instead of vegging in front of the tube. The major drawback has been sweating. I was getting chills and sweating a lot! Originally thought it could be hormones, but not after reading others' comments matching my symptoms. I was jittery at first, but now smooth sailing. I tell lots of people how happy I am with the results. I loved Welbutrin but am allergic.",9,27
Strattera,"I knew I always was ADHD, but I found that this medicine really helped to stabilize my mood. I used to be grouchy all the time, now I feel more laid back. I also suffer from Ulnar Neuropathy, and it seems to really help with the pain! So far I enjoy this medicine. I'm a little concerned it might directly affect my short-term memory though.",8,13
Strattera,"I'm a 26 year old female and been taking Straterra for 2 weeks for ADD and I love it. Straterra has been a miracle for me. Before I would start projects and never finish them but now I finish them. I'm actually happy instead of being down on myself and staying frustrated all the time my husband says I smile and laugh a lot more. I am experiencing some of the side effects, dry mouth, chills weight loss and I don't eat near as much but I needed to lose weight and ate to much before taking the drug. I just hope this medicine continues to work for me because so far its awesome.",8,54
Strattera,"I've been taking Strattera for half a month now, I am 34, and it seems to be doing a pretty good job of increasing my attention span.  I have some, but not many signs of decreased sexual appetite, depression, or suicidal thoughts.  I HAVE, however, noticed that I am biting my tongue on the right side of my mouth and when I forget to take the medicine this stops.  It usually happens when I am concentrating, and while I was typing this review, I found myself doing it again. This is very strange, as I haven't heard about it. Also, when I get the shivers, I notice that they now linger at the top of my scalp. I am assuming this has something to do with increased blood flow in your brain or some such thing.",9,14
Strattera,"I am a 31 year old female and I tried strattera as my first adhd medication. I have been on an antidepressant for years as well. I liked the way this medication made me feel so much calmer. However, it gave me miserable heart burn, to where I would lose sleep and be so uncomfortable at other times as well. I also felt a little agitated but my anxiety level did go way down on this medication. I also had to take it at night because it made me very sleepy. Upon my doctors advice we decided to change to adderall er.",6,10
Strattera,"Better than a lot of other ADHD medications. Helped me lose 5-10lbs in only a month, but my weight remained the same for a while then went back up to original weight, probably because of starting other medications. Been on it for 8 months, and it has helped with reading and impulsivity related to ADHD, but does not give a boost of energy and productivity like Dexedrine or Vyvanse does.",8,14
Strattera,"I was started on Strattera almost 3 years ago.  Before taking this medication I was constantly on rabbit trails couldn't finish a project and trying to do 3 or 4 things at the same time, which I wasn't doing very well.  I've probably been ADHD all my life but was not diagnosed until I was 50.  I have gone back to school and work as an inpatient crisis stabilization nurse.  I should be the poster child for this medication because it has been a miracle for me.  I take 100 mg of the medication a day.  The only thing I can complain about is the medication wears off sometimes before I get off of work. This probably could be fixed with a simple medication time and dosage change.",10,62
Strattera,"I have been using Strattera for about 10 months and had great success for the first 9.  I felt great, very focused and able to get things done, and had no negative side effects except for a little bit of dry mouth for the first couple of weeks.  About a month ago I experienced a bout of depression until my doctor switched my prescription from 1 80mg pill a day to 2 40mg pills each day (once in the morning and once in the evening).  After the switch, I was back to feeling great until last week when I had another bout of depression.  This morning I took 5mg of Ritalin and snapped right out of my depressed mood.  My doctor has suggested stopping Strattera and using Ritalin instead to try to determine if Strattera is the cause.",8,17
Strattera,I have been on and off Strattera for last two years. Strangely enough besides some dry mouth and dizziness at the beginning I have no side effects at all. I went up on my dose to 75 now. The only problem is that it is hard for me to say if it works or not.,8,4
Strattera,I'm a 47 yr old female. This medicine greatly improved my attention. I was able to complete tasks at work. Organize my work and home. The problem was that my heart would beat rapidly at night keeping me awake. I stopped taking it when my blood pressure increased significantly.,5,15
Strattera,"Worked for a half year, then I got paranoid, depression and ADHD started to show, and had really bad headaches.",3,18
Strattera,My son was in kindergarten when he was diagnosed with ADHD. Strattera was the second medicine we tried and it worked great. His teacher and us at home noticed the change and could always tell if he missed his dose. He is now 13 and in 8th grade and has decided to take himself off the medicine. Hes been off it since before last summer and is doing great. Hoping because he was medicated at a young age that he may have out grown his symptoms. I would recommend Strattera to anyone.,10,50
Strattera,"Stratterra is incredible. I began taking it in 5th grade, after Adderall and Ritalin both failed me. I heard from my doctor that Strattera works for a less percentage of people than stimulants (like Adderall and Ritalin), but if you have had trouble with stimulants, Stratterra is worth a try. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and both Adderall and Ritalin caused me to have spontaneous anxiety attacks. While Strattera does not treat my anxiety, it does not increase it. Strattera will NOT work automatically, like stimulants. It took about a month for my Strattera to work, and in that month I experienced a lot of nausea, drowsiness and headaches. I encourage you to ask your doctor about Strattera if nothing else has worked.",10,31
Strattera,"36 year old female with ADHD, Depression, Fibromialgia, Severe Menopausal hot flashes, and Panic Attacks: total hysterectomy at 29.  Strattera #22 or so on my list of Antidepressants, Nerve Pills, Sleeping Pills, Hormones, Herbal supplements, etc.  The Gyno got with the Psychiatrist and weeded out tons of things that I'm severely allergic to and came to the Strattera (no red dye, sulfa, codeine,..).  It eliminated hot flashes entirely, I lost 50 pounds, I focus better.  All else I just have to deal with.  It makes me severely nauseated and gives me a migraine every day and makes my heart beat irregularly pretty often and I can't eat after it at all, but I am up living, working, playing with my grandchildren, NOT sleeping and crying.",9,33
Strattera,"I've been on this medicine (80mg) for about a year now.  Every time I go off of it or forget to take it for whatever reason, I have the same side effects when I start up again: severe nausea and dizziness, to the point where I have to lay down for up to an hour at a time.  However, those pale in comparison to the benefits: I can focus, complete both small tasks and big projects, read and comprehend material more easily, and am infinitely more relaxed and less anxious.  I've also been in recovery for a food addiction for the past three years and it's helped tremendously with the compulsive thoughts about food.  Unfortunately I'm now noticing that the benefits seem to be wearing off, and I'm considering either upping my dosage or switching medicines.",9,24
Strattera,My doctor gave me a 30 day trial of Strattera with incrementing doses each week. It started with 10mg and the last week was 60mg. I didn't really notice a positive difference with any dosage but I did have an extremely detailed and horrific dream the first two nights but after that my sleeping was normal. As far as side effects other than the two night terrors I was slightly constipated. It took a lot more effort to make myself do #2. I'm currently on Adderall XR and it seems to do the trick.,1,12
Strattera,"I'm 46 and recently diagnosed with ADHD.  Straterra is the first and only medication I've tried for this condition.  I've been on it for 2 weeks and notice profound improvements in my ability to concentrate, absorb material, and complete tasks.  That is what I had hoped to achieve with Straterra.  However, I am experiencing some unpleasant side effects, including difficulty urinating (very slow flow and the sensation that I'm not finished after my bladder is empty) and frothy ejaculations during sex that occur without any sensation of orgasm.  For now, I can accept the trade off, as I am much more productive at work.  But I'm really hoping these side effects disappear or diminish.",7,27
Strattera,"Been on this medicine since I was 11. Been upping the dosage up to 60mg from 15, now 17 years old still taking. Incredibly good at keeping my attention and solving ADHD. Used to be a troublemaker, now in college preparing for university, but has minor side effects for example I feel down and depressed randomly.  I also feel drowsy for a little while.",8,26
Strattera,"Hi, 36 year old male here.  I've been on Strattera for 2 weeks already and so far so good.  My metabolism has always been fast so I noticed an improvement on the 1st day!  I was able to concentrate and focus at work and it has enabled me to focus in class(I'm in grad school).  For me, the medicine kicks in about 1/2 hour after I take it and for the first 10-15 minutes or so, I get a sort of sleepy feeling but once I start a mental activity, it goes away.  Its very weird because I tried to take it at night and although it gives me that sleepy feeling, the medicine keeps my brain awake.  One time I took it at 9pm and I couldn't fall asleep till 4am!  After that event, I just find it better to take it in the morning after my workout.",9,42
Strattera,"Been on Strattera for 3 months and can't wait to get off it! It had helped my concentration to an okay extent but I'm having bizarre side effects such as leaking semen followed by testicular pain, paranoia, weird thoughts, anxiety and slight tics. Not recommended for long term use!",3,14
Strattera,"I have tried a variety of medications for ADD; including Ritalin, Adderall, Adderall XR, Dexedrine, and Strattera. Each has benefits along with side effects.  After several years medicating with central nervous system stimulants (CNS) I  switched to Strattera. I found the medication took a few weeks to take effect, and tended to cause constipation. I also found my psychological state was less effective if I became dehydrated.  To counter the side effects I added All-Bran into my diet twice a week, and drank more liquids. The big benefit for myself was I could enjoy reading books again, which I could not on the CNS stimulants.",8,46
Strattera,I was diagnosed with ADHD in 6th grade and have taken Stattera ever since. I am a college student now and its worked so well for me that I continuously make good grades. I would recommend this medicine to anyone who is having problems finding one to work.,9,36
Strattera,This works great for my daughter who would daydream and often get stuck in negative thought patterns like I can't do it.,9,38
Strattera,Had no side effects while on this medication.  My new insurance would not cover it so I was unable to afford it.,8,14
Strattera,It was very expensive and provided no help.,4,7
Strattera,"At first, I had to take it with a high protein meal...and even then, I had some nausea.  Now I've figured out a way for it to not cause nausea, yet get into my system:  Take RIGHT BEFORE you go to bed!  This way, it gets into my system, helps me to sleep 7-8 hours a night, and I feel in control of my feelings/moods instead of a slight fog all the time. THIS medicine works;  the others I've tried (Ritalin, Dexedrine) produced unwanted side effects.  I'm staying with what works!",10,114
Strattera,Got sick a good three times during the first week and felt dizzy. Continued to take it for another 2 weeks every morning but it made me drowsy to the point that I had to take a nap everyday. Switched to taking it at night before bed and could not sleep at all. On a positive note I did notice my concentration levels increased a bit but was surprised how I could read an article or a textbook and remember the information I had just read.,4,35
Strattera,"I experienced decreased physical ability, lost muscle tone and stamina. My sexual desire dropped sharply. I was unable to motivate myself and had no desire to do anything. This drug takes away individual thought and makes you do things without the desire or want to do them.",3,31
Strattera,"I am 65 yrs old; and been dealing with learning disability all my life. However, only recently a clinical psychologist, who I went to for some testing, recommended Ritalin, Adderall which caused unpleasant side effects then Strattera 40 mg. Strattera has been the drug that works for me. I am definitely more focused and can stay focused on reading a book or newspaper article to completion without anxiety and frustration of having to read the same paragraph over and over again. I have always been treated with Paxil for anxiety attacks over the years but this drug seems to work better in that I am happy to feel more focused, interested and involved with everything I do and being with my kids seems to be more enjoyable for me. I EMBRACE these feelings.",10,155

My grades have increased, I am able to focus in class, and I can excel and prosper. My doctor has told me that eventually I will be weaned off of Strattera because my brain should be able to adapt. All I can say is. I never experienced any horrible side effects, if any. I can't say I remember any side effects. And I know that it is not addictive since I am able to stop taking the drug during the summer time. I've had a moderately positive experience on Strattera. I hope everyone else does too.",10,147
Strattera,"I hated this medication! I became so sick when my doctor put me on it.  I took myself off of it and magically the next day I was %100 better.  My doctor tried to tell me it wasn't the medication so I tried it again but, magically I got sick again.",1,15
Strattera,"My son began taking Strattera about 3 - 4 years ago.  He had a bad reaction to Adderal, so the doctor tried Strattera as a non-stimulant.  He first started 18 mg once a day, no noticeable change. Then increased over time to 50 mg once a day.  He wasn't defiant, but just didn't (doesn't) care to do much of anything.  4-6 weeks ago he started having tics. Not putting the two together, last month his doctor increased to 60 mg a day and the tics have continued to get worse.   He's also been more depressed, having panic attacks, and anxiety.  He goes to school, but gets nothing done.  Went back to his doctor and she know has started taking him off this medication.  I hope the tics stop.  He's scared and this continues to add to his anxiety.",2,32
Strattera,"Diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety, found symptoms lessened with Wellbutrin XR. Year later diagnosed with adult ADHD, all ADD with little HD. Started Strattera and felt a slight improvement in focus, but also felt distant and flat. Stopped Strattera due to severe constipation. Tried Adderall, little effect on focus and concentration, and turned into a Chatty Cathy. I did sleep better than ever though. Next, Ritalin with close to the same effects, but without the great sleep. Back to Strattera to give it another shot, constipation lessened, but still feel that it is not helping with the ADD. Considered adding Adderall or Ritalin in with, but Doctor now recommending psych evaluation to look deeper. Scary, but necessary.",3,17
Strattera,"Taking it for adult ADHD and it doesn't work.  Still focus in my classes, no appetite and very moody, coupled with insomnia.",3,12
Strattera,I liked the fact that this medication help me focus but it seemed as I was very distant. I didn't like how it made me just not want to move or do anything.  I am 24 and just recently found out I have ADHD and it is most likely I have had it all my life. I have trouble with finishing what I start and just can't stay focused! So right now it is just trying to find the right kind of medication for me before I start back up at school in January.,4,16
Strattera,"I first started 18 mg once a day, no noticeable change. Then increased to 40 mg once a day, at first I seemed to just be calm and zombie like with no change to my ADD. Then, 2-3 weeks later insomnia, paranoia, depression, rage, panic attacks, and severe anxiety consumed me so badly I couldn't leave my house. I feared for my safety and the safety of others so I stopped the drug immediately! I was having thoughts of violence toward others and myself, I am a 28 year old woman and was on no other medications and no other conditions besides ADD. I'd rather just deal with my ADD than all those scary feelings I've never had before.",1,113

Strattera,At first the drug company advertised this mercilessly as the solution to adult ADHD. The only problem is that it doesn't work. I noticed nothing at all in the three months I tried it.,1,20
Strattera,It works wonders. I like it.,10,28
Strattera,"My 6 year old son was prescribed Strattera because he has Tourettes and it was felt the stimulants would make it worse. He has been on 10 mg daily for the last 4 days and so far I am pleased. The first day I gave it he slept all afternoon and was awake off and on all night. I changed the time I gave it to late afternoon and have not noticed this problem anymore. He is not overly drowsy at school. His teacher sent a note noticing he appeared to pay attention in class more and today was the FIRST day since the school year started that he didn't get in trouble for disrupting class. I have noticed his appetite and thirst have increased somewhat but he wasn't a big eater to begin with, so this is actually positive to me.",0,99
Strattera,"Strattera works great. I am able to focus and am able to do more tasks at once, which my job requires. I am now able to sit down for more than 10 minutes at a time and read, write, and study for my college classes. The only thing that bothers me is that I sometimes forget to take my dose of medication. Other than this instance, I am able to function better as a person!",9,67
Strattera,"I currently take Topamax (for migraines) fluoxetine (Prozac)and Klonopin. I had tried Concerta but that pooped out on me fairly quickly so I was suggested to try Strattera. I was hesitant at first knowing that there was a very low percentage rate of those for which the drug has actually worked successfully for but knowing my own body and mind maybe it would be a great idea to give it a shot. At first the side effects did start the headaches and the occasional upset stomach but they went away with time as my body got used to the medication and the higher dosage. No matter what, you should give this drug a chance.",10,86
Strattera,"This was my first time trying ADHD medication, and unfortunately it didn't go so well. My nurse practitioner warned me that there was a chance of panic attacks with Strattera, as I had previously had some with Wellbutrin, but I was unprepared for how intense they would be. Even on a very low dose. The first one happened on 10 mg, and there were several others on 18 and 25. I didn't take the higher step up, and had to stop. I know there are a lot of people who love Strattera, but anyone who's had a panic attack on Wellbutrin might want to avoid it.",1,26
Strattera,I got way to many mental and physical negative side effects and it didn't seem to help that much. Although at times I felt I could pay attention better. I was only on 10mg. My doctor told me to stop taking it and now I have to see a psychiatrist.,3,12
Strattera,"I have had ADD all my life. Starting in 5th grade, my psychiatrist put me on Concerta. I didn't eat well and I didn't grow for almost three years. When my doctor expressed concern, I was switched to Strattera. I am now a senior in high school, and have been on Strattera for five years. I haven't noticed any side effects and it has truly been a blessing in my life.",10,182
Strattera,"My doctor thinks my problems - fatigue, lack of focus, body aches are symptoms of ADD. I was never officially diagnosed. Looking back at my younger days I think it's quite possible. He started with Ritalin 20mg/day. It did give me energy and motivation but not the focus. I'd want to get 10 things done and I'd start 10 things but at the end of the day I'd have 10 things halfway done. He added Strattera to it, starting at 18mg and working up to 40mg where I am now. It has helped immensely. I now complete one project before moving to the next. At the end of the day I may only have 8 things of the 10 done but they are complete. The only side effect I had was some very bad vertigo which strangely enough seemed to lessen as the dosage went up. May be due to tolerance.",0,83
Strattera,"I'm 32 and have been on this drug for about 8 months now. For me, it's been incredible. I am no longer on an emotional roller coaster and definitely more patient and no where as near irritable as I used to be. I'm on a dosage of 120 mg daily. I take it at night before I sleep. However, a possible side effect for me is hypothyroidism - but, I did have hyperthyroidism as a child so I don't know if Strattera caused it to come back as hypo or it's because of my age. I did unfortunately gain considerable weight, but with the thyroid pills, I have been slowly losing it again.",9,49
Strattera,Medicine information says watch for changes in mood or behavior. My experience with my girlfriend is that this is a dangerous drug for people with mania.,1,29
Strattera,"The first day I took an 18mg pill. I was tired during the day, so I stopped. My doctor suggested I try again, this time taking 5mg before bed. After a few days of feeling tired all day, I realized something was very wrong. I also read that there is a possible interaction with Wellbutrin XL, which I am also taking. I stopped the Strattera and am back to normal again.",1,18
Strattera,I did increase in awareness but the grades are still the same for me.,8,9
Strattera,"This worked great for my ADHD symptoms. My family noticed an immediate improvement. I did get a little bit of weight loss, but that was good for me (38 years old). My biggest problem was that it caused erectile dysfunction and a strange lack of sensation in my prostate area, even at low dosage (18 mg/day). It was sufficient to stop use.  I am on Adderall XR now which doesn't do nearly as well.  My doctor is going to try me on some antidepressants as they also influence the norepinephrine levels.  If you don't get the erectile dysfunction then this is a great medication.",7,13
Strattera,"I've been using this for three years and it helps me. I've paid attention more at school. I've had no side effects at all, but all medications may have different effects on other people.",10,56
Strattera,"It worked quite well in the first 2 weeks with a lot of things. My thought process, my mood, my socializing, getting school work done much faster, not procrastinating. Then after 3 weeks on the medicine, it plummeted. I had more side effects after 3rd week when dosage raised to 20 mg as 10 mg did not work. Had heart palpitation, was sweaty, muscle weakness, extremely tired.",6,50
Strattera,"I was prescribed this medicine, 40mg twice a day. I read a lot of information before deciding to take this. I am a 40 year old black female and have had struggles for many years while in school. I decided to go back to school and also tried this to see if there was a difference. It takes a while before you notice a change in the ability to focus. When earning my 1st degree, I struggled in school, probably all my life. While on Strattera, I could sit and study for hours and not be distracted. I went from struggling to earn C's maybe a B, to Earning A's and maybe a B. I actually understood what I was studying and didn't feel like doing 3-4 other things at the same time. I stopped taking it because of an EKG that showed an irregular heart beat. A side effect.",10,175
Strattera,I was really irritated and aggressive all the time. My patience was almost non-existent. I broke my car window when I started taking this drug.,1,86

Strattera,"I'm a 32 year old male and have had symptoms of ADHD all my life, but chose not to treat it because the types of medications available seemed to 'take something away' from my personality.  I finally reached a point that my wife begged me to do something, so I started with Strattera due to my doctor's recommendation.  I've been on 40mg for 2 months now, and notice a major difference.  I now have a desire to get on the floor and play with the kids, whereas before it seemed tedious and boring.  I find that I'm not as tired at the end of the day/week because my thoughts are not distracted, by all the 'noise' that I seem to have from the ADHD.  I'm still new to the drug, and things could change, but for now, I am really happy.",10,312
Strattera,I loved the way Adderall helped with my ADD (adult). I was able to get soooo much done while on it.,6,12
Strattera,"For me this drug causede headaches everyday, nausea and gagging, and dry mouth all the time. I noticed a change in personality - easily agitated, I was distant and lost my affectionate side. My doctor made me come off it slowly before I started Concerta. Coming off it is just as bad.",1,74

Strattera,"I have tried many different prescriptions over the years to treat ADD, with various degrees of success. On other medications, I felt as though my thought patterns were altered or constrained. While on Strattera, its great to not even notice it's influence other than that I now feel as though I am better equipped to organize my thoughts. Every medication will have side effects but I think the benefits of taking a non-stimulant medication are worth it.",9,97
Strattera,I have ADHD and am 27 years old.  I have been using Strattera for four months. The first month I was taking too much and made me really sleepy. After spliting the two 40mg up that worked well.  People around me that didn't know I was taking anything said I seemed more relaxed and easygoing.,7,62
Strattera,"I am an adult in my late 30's. I have taken this drug off and on for the last year and a half, because my medical doesn't cover it and it is very expensive for me. When I was given samples, my family can see the difference in my thoughts and organization.",7,60
Strattera,"My 8 year old son has ADHD and was put on this medication. Well the entire family thinks it's the best thing for him. We notice right away if he hasn't taken his medicine, as soon as he wakes up. It didn't really help calm him down, but more helps him focus clearly. We have seen a drastic change in school as well. I would tell anyone who has ADHD about it.",9,188

Atomoxetine,"38 Male ADHD. I am great after 8 weeks. AFTER 8 WEEKS. It's not instant like stimulants. Takes time to build up. For everyone knocking it here it seems that they are not giving it time to work. You really need to give it time and the side effects fade off. This medication, after 8 weeks, has changed my life. Stopped compulsive behavior, calms the mind and increases focus for sure. Yes it does make you sluggish.........so take it at night and wake up feeling clear headed. You can't compare it to stimulants. It works completely different. So if you're looking for a rush....stick to stimulants. Strattera is calm and focused.",10,4

No appetite, hard time peeing. Not impressed. I Don't know if I should try to suffer through another day or not. So far I've tried this, clonidine, guafacine, and wellbutrin. Its all garbage for me.",1,0
Atomoxetine,"<b>Strattera (atomoxetine):</b>			 This Strattera is  the best ADHD medication I've had so far. It takes a LONG time to kick in. I was supposed to feel the full effects a month into taking it, but I didn't get them for maybe 2-3 months. However, it was worth it for me. Instead of just giving me energy and turning me into an emotionless robot like stimulants, it reworked my brain.  My whole brain functions better now. I don't procrastinate, and I can pay attention and work better. I have branched out into different hobbies because it gives you motivation. This is in effect 24/7 because it doesn't leave your system or wear off like stimulants. Now, the side effects. I still zone out and dissociate. There is a decrease in appetite (not as bad as the stimulant in that area, though). I have vivid dreams/nightmares. I feel tired often, and nap a lot. Also, I feel more depressed in general. None of these side effects are very severe, but they can be difficult at times. However, I really do recommend giving Strattera a good chance.",0,16

But after the 4 weeks my poor focus came back I am now on 60mg  once a day and still feel nothing Im extremely agitated and annoyed with everyone yet calm as hell still but waiting to blow if u get that.

So I started using Strattera. On 10 mg, I didnt feel anything.  On 25mg I started having some problems with insomnia and little bit of anxiety. On 40mg I finally got to know, what real anxiety is. Staying up till 3 am, sitting on my bed with racing thoughts, fast heart beat and high blood pressure. Being sure, that I have Schizophrenia and that Im going to loose control of my brain. Waking up a few times per night, sometimes with hypnagogic hallucinations and feeling like a total trash throughout the next day.

Chronic constipation which progressed to 14 days between bowel movements led to SIBO causing extreme bloating/distention and extremely minimized appetite.

She is skin and bones and has dropped a clothing size. She says that food isnt good anymore and has to basically force feed herself.

In the beginning it made me very nauseous and there was vomiting, but not if you eat with a meal. I take it in the morning. I feel that if you wait, you will eventually become accustomed to the dosage and see results similar to Vyvanse. I take 40mg a day.",0,13
Atomoxetine,"I was once on Vyvanse, then I was taken off. I was prescribed Atomoxetine (Strattera,) and my first impression was an improvement in mood. While it did help with ADHD I found it still harder to concentrate compared to a stimulant. A little insomnia did happen but it was nothing one couldn't manage. I did however experience Discontinuation Shock Syndrome when I missed doses, and especially when I had to go cold-turkey because I couldn't afford my $15 co-pay. I really knew if I missed a dose if I kept getting dizzy, dizziness was all that happened though really. Regardless, I am now back on Vyvanse because I need it.",6,0
Atomoxetine,"<b>Strattera (atomoxetine):</b>			 I started with 40mg of Strattera and worked my way up to 80mg. The only side effects I've experienced are some mild queasiness and drowsiness, and once my body got used to the medication those side effects went away! I've noticed significant mood improvement with the combination of this drug and diet/ exercise. Planning for the future is noticeably less stressful and I even found it easier to do simple things like grocery shopping and coming into work early. Im still not perfect, because I have still missed a dentists appointment. Ive also noticed less cognitive distortions, which makes things more comfortable. I will say that it still doesnt help with the immediate distractions or impulses, like stimulants do. It takes some time for it to work, you have to take it every day, and you still need to live a healthy life. So even if it helps a little its not some miracle drug. Manage your expectations if youre considering asking your doctor about it.",0,26

Atomoxetine,"I've been taking atomoxetine 80mg for 8 weeks for ADHD and here is my review:  I noticed very slight improvements in controlling racing and intrusive thoughts - only slightly. This medicine does take a while to achieve maximum effectiveness, but I'm still at level 1.   I sleep way more on this drug than off. For example, after 20-30 minutes of taking 80 mg on an empty stomach, I fall asleep for up to two hours.    I do feel somewhat calmer and able to slow down to actually listen to to people. I don't get upset and frustrated like I did before, but my focus is pretty much the same. I still haven't done anything remarkable.   In other words, atomoxetine is good at taking some of the tension away, but nothing for focusing thoughts. It works great for some people; I wish I was one of them.   I am going to try a stimulant, like Adderall. I don't need to sleep all day anymore.",3,3

This medicine takes 4-6 weeks to fully go into effect and I will be waiting till then to see how it goes. Medicine works differently on everyone, so while some people think it's awful, others may think it's the best thing that's ever happened to them. If your doctor prescribes it, I suggest taking it and waiting till the 4-6 week mark unless it makes you physically ill, and even then I would give it a week or two to see if it goes away. This kind of thing is normally hit or miss and you might have to go through a few meds before you find one that is right for you.

I had terrible anxiety, couldn't sleep, couldn't think straight and had dry mouth for months. This slowly improved over two and a half years until I felt normal again. But now after being on other meds like Cipro my symptoms came back and I have to start over. I'm sensitive to any mood altering substance land probably will be for the rest of my life! I used to have goals but now I struggle to survive. I have a friend who came off it fine but in my opinion it's not worth it. Other people I've talked to have had similar reactions.

Also after taking it for two weeks, I started getting a horrible, bitter taste in my mouth about twice a day with an acidic feeling in my stomach (not associated with any food or drink). And I have extreme dry mouth. I had dry mouth while taking Adderall, too, but the dry mouth Im experiencing on Strattera is off the charts! And it has done something weird with my focus.

I feel like my mood, decision making skills and overall energy are improving. The drug has no affect on concentration compared to Adderall so we will need to address that.

Atomoxetine,<b>Strattera (atomoxetine):</b>			 Strattera works well for me. Lets be straight with the facts folk. Strattera should be dosed at least to 1.2 mg /per kilo body weight  Or 80 mg a day (optimal dose for most people) - if you take less then 1.2 mg/kg the risk is high that the effect that you feel is too low or placebo - (this is proven in lots of real life medical trials).  After about 6-8 weeks (during which your blood pressure is taken regularly) - its effect should be evaluated by your doctor - please have patience with the medicine to work.  If the response is to low - it should be dosed up to 100 mg or higher. A doctor should know this things - its mandatory in Sweden to have this knowledge among doctors below 80mg a day is SUBOPTIMAL dosing. 100-120 mg should not be exceeded. This fact in the medical sheet/package with your medicine. Please inform your doc about this simple facts.,0,30

I am looking for a substitute for Ritalin because although it worked miracles for my lack of attention an organizing skills it eventually wore me out. My new neurologist suggested Strattera (80 mg/day ). At first it made me very tired. After a few weeks Strattera changed me into an emotional wreck. Crying every minute for no reason. I'm still in hospital. I'm so tired of trying something new and hoping it will make the fog in my head disappear. But we're back to square one. No more Strattera fore me...,0,30

I had some side effects (dry mouth, if I wake up too fast I get dizzy, difficulties to pee sometimes, sometimes erections are difficult to keep) but I can live with them since they not always happen. I can have orgasms like normal and I sleep like a baby since I take it.

My current dose is 25mg, and I also take Adderall, 10mg twice a day. If I had to describe Strattera, it is a great focus/ motivation medication, but it also ups the anxiety, and adderall seems to up it even more. My doctor really doesn't have another solution than to take ativan. Coffee makes Strattera worse, but sometimes it won't kick in without the morning coffee.",0,38

It certainly completely cured my hyper-activity, but it never helped my focus one bit.

I started out in high school with XR, switched to vyvanse, and everything was working fine. I became severely dependent on this medication. I could not get out bed without it; I was miserable if I was not on it; I isolated myself from everyone; and it led me to other addictions which I will not discuss on here. My grades were going  down the toilet ( I could not complete any work without it), and I started buying it from the streets. I had to go to inpatient rehab for this medication. I started a 12 step program and for 6 months I have been off this medication. I feel more balanced with certain coping skills (community outreach, yoga, meditation).

I've tried literally every ADD drug there is except Zenzedi and Desoxyn (methamphetamine HCL). I've even tried modafinil. Chemically Vyvanse, dexedrine, and Zenzedi are the same with just different absorption. Adderall is 80% dexedrine with 20% levoamphetamine, which is more physically stimulating than dextroamphetamine. If you are like me, hate stimulants because of the crash at night and morning exhaustion, I  need a drug that lasts all day and is smooth then consider Mydayis. I only wrote this to help anyone who's considering Mydayis. I would never waste my time helping any pharm company with a review. Mydayis is unique and different from Adderall and the other dextroamphetamine stimulants because it has amphetamine in addition to other dex salts. Give it a try... If you have trouble with insomnia from taking it then your dose is too high!! Just drop it. Good luck",0,41

I took Vyvanse for over a year and I thought I loved it, until I realized it gave me anxiety because I was trying to cram 16 hours worth of homework and chores into the short period of time the medication worked. My neurologist had me switch to taking Mydayis and I have loved it because I do not feel the  high  that vyvanse gives you, and in turn I also do not feel the medication slowing down either. Now, I still take it at 5:30am, but I can do homework or concentrate on other tasks well past 8 or 9 pm.  Advantages: -long lasting -continuous feeling throughout day (no ups and downs) Disadvantages: -makes me not feel hungry -loss of appetite can make low blood sugar hit me all at once if I forget to eat  -if I sleep in on the weekends I cant take it because it will last too long Hope my experience helps!

Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine,<b>Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine):</b>			 I am only giving this a 7 because it definitely made a change in my ability to concentrate for long periods but it was not a pleasant experience. As soon as I took the medicine it would make me feel exhausted and tired. I would have to fight the tiredness to get any benefit out of it. By the end of the day I was drained. It also made me extra agitated. I couldn't focus on more than one thing at a time so when someone would distract me I would get very irritated. I also tensed up my muscles and had bad neck/bad pain. I switched to Ritalin but that was crap too. They put me on Vyvanse and it feels similar but less intense than adderall so we shall see.,0,19
Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine,"I was diagnosed with ADD as a child and had been prescribed several medications including wellbutrin, nuerontin, and metadate. All proved ineffective (and the wellbutrin Damn near killed me). Finally I was introduced to Adderall. Adderall finally helped me focus while elevating my mood. I even became friendlier, because I was no longer frustrating myself trying to find the words I wanted to say.  The side effects were mostly mild and went away once the medication built up in my system. Dry mouth, fidgeting, mild erectile dysfunction. Vasoconstriction was the only side effect that tended to linger, and I recently discovered the hard way that if you are experiencing vasoconstriction, it is wise to avoid heavy exertion.",8,3

My grades were always C's and D's no matter how hard I tried. I was always fidgety, had a hard time sitting still, always twirling my hair or shaking my legs or feet. I hated school, I felt so dumb. As I got into high school I was so far behind I gave up trying. When I started driving I would go through red lights, stop signs etc. I was just daydreaming all the time.

I must warn people adderall is a stimulant, it's out of your body rather quickly (1-2 days) so addiction in the physical withdrawal sense is not much, although years of taking it will keep you relying on it -that's a PROMISE. Depending on the dosage you'll be severely lethargic and wind up sleeping a few days. Beware of the day's end, you'll likely need something to sleep, or relax which can cause problems.

Adderall has given me focus, lifted my general mood, taken my anxiety away and made me a productive human being. I'm actually starting my own business! The only bad thing is that you really have to be careful of how much you take because it can have the opposite effect i.e. severe anxiety and no focus but if you take it the right way it will change your life!

Next to Vyvanse, Adderall XR has been the most helpful. If I take it any later than noon, I will absolutely have insomnia. I also have to be careful about the foods I eat, and especially try to avoid my multi-vitamin in the morning (because of the citric acid). It doesn't decrease my appetite, sometimes I feel like it increases it, but it prevents me from binge-eating. I take 20mg Adderall XR with 25mg of Zoloft and though it helps with my OCD tendencies that Adderall is likely to cause, I don't think the combination works as well as Adderall XR by itself.

I tried to be unmedicated as an adult, but that only produced anxiety, likely due to my naturally occurring rapid thought processing and tendency to fail to complete projects (distracted by new thoughts). My quality of life is significantly better when I take Adderall and I see no shame to be had in that. I experience dry mouth fairly often, but overall it is amazing and totally worth it.

Some people note increased aggression- I feel that I am capable of being more (verbally) aggressive because there is less anxiety to dampen the desire for confrontation.  However, I feel more capable of choosing whether or not to pursue confrontation. The other day at the bank, I calmly voiced my discontent over erroneous charges the bank made to my account (for the 3rd time!).  When the employee became a bit agitated, I decided to end the conversation rather than escalate the argument.  I was satisfied with my performance- I said my piece, got the closet thing to an apology I was going to get, and got out.   Adderall seems to make this easier- I don't feel as rev'd up as I would otherwise.  Our stress reactions to everyday situations like these are often way out of proportion to the stakes and Adderall seems to dampen down the reaction to something more appropriate.

Methylphenidate,"<b>Ritalin (methylphenidate):</b>			 I'm 24 y.o male that self diagnosed ADHD about 6 months ago. From as far back as I remember I was restless, inattentive, depressed and forgetful but I didn't know that what was wrong with me. I thought that everybody has a unique behaviour and mind and so this unusual type is mine and I should control it by myself! From childhood I was the kid who study hard but gained little, who is forgetful, who is weak in math! Who is lazy. Anyway, now I'm medical student and I found that I have ADD after a long story.  I told this to my attending physician and he confirmed that I have ADD, then prescribed ritalin 10mg per day and increased that to the dose 10mg ×3 a day. The best word I can tell you about Ritalin for ADD patients is Miracle. Now for the first time in my life I understand the meaning of being calm, being happy, being focused, being organized and many other good 'Being's'. It was a huge change in my life and I'm happy for that. The side effects for me was very mild and gone with the time and I want to continue it.",0,40

I've tried probably every antidepressant there is, and quite a few for anxiety. But this I think personally Concerta has helped quite a bit in regards to both. Because of it I've been able to wean off my antidepressant and no longer have to take it. The appetite suppressant does help me out since I'm working on weight loss, but it can also be a struggle to eat at times or find a food that is appetizing in general because of it. And the medication can cause constipation and dry mouth, which is inconvenient. Overall, I think it's helped me a lot in focusing on course work and it's intended purpose.",0,10

Then I took 20mg, I felt a little more energized but nothing else. Then I tried 30mg today. I felt extremely fresh in my mind, instead of the weird slump I'm usually in. Very happy, which suggests that what I lacked before was dopamine. Still no difference with anything else, like my poor concentration and focus, but on the other side there is no side effects as of late.

But I'm still figuring out what works for me, I find I am quite resistant to most drugs like I need more than most people but I only weigh 40kg so I'm a little disappointed at the moment but I think it might just be a tolerance thing and maybe I should only take it when I need it like for university.",0,4

I have had some of the above side effects but with time I just got better and better. I am confident a lot more rational and patient I have also been told this by my wife. I get more done than just procrastinating . I can actually make a decision now . The longer I am on it the better I get . At first it made me feel very quiet and I wouldnt talk much . I felt it took my personality away but that has balanced out. It makes me feel a little speedy but very relaxed and calm. Its amazing to not have my mind constantly bombarded by so much garbage. My wife calls it a miracle apparently I dont repeat myself and obsess so much lol.,0,13
Methylphenidate,"<b>Concerta (methylphenidate):</b>			 Someone in the sea of reviews wanted to know how to make these medications last longer. I discovered a way but your not going to like it unless you stick to it, then you will discover the medication will be stronger, more receptive to your body, and last longer. Cut out all carbs. Eat a diet where carbs are lower than 30 carbs per day. The lower you go, the better the effects. Its also called keto. But I also do long term fasting as well up to 3 days, then eat , then repeat a few times a month. But for the most part, only living keto will benefit you the best. The most would be to throw in some fasts monthly.",0,11

I started getting really bad panic attacks to the point, I would actually call 911 for paramedics and an ambulance. Talk about embarrassing! What finally changed my life and made me fell so much better was when my dr. prescribed the Ritalin 10mg twice a day to me Not only did it really help my attention issues, I have not had one panic attack since I started taking this stuff.

The reason that I scored this medication on the lower spectrum is because when I was taking this medicine I would get severe headaches.

Withdrawal is hard. You are tired. I think it is best to do it over a vacation. 5 years on, I tried again. But this time I had developed certain anxiety behaviors surrounding my work and the Concerta greatly magnified these anxieties. So I stopped. In summary: 27mg is a great dose for me as an adult female. 36mg = too much  - not sure what the dosage kids are on, but please be careful!

It did give me a strong boost of energy which lasted throughout the day. After 2 hours was when things got really bad. I guess this is the 'crash'. It made me horribly depressed, anxious, and filled with rage. The anxiety was so bad that every single thing I set eyes on would trigger me, like looking at the laundry basket filled with laundry.  I also felt extremely anti-social and didn't want to talk to anyone, not even my husband. Finally towards the end of the night I would return to my normal self again, but you can imagine the emotional roller-coaster I experienced the entire day.

This was a vital part in my education during the early years in school. I can safely say, that I have learned/gained experience from this medicine as well it really helping me out.

Also I would hear random things and see random things and I would over think. My eating went from eating just fine to maybe a banana and some chips a day . When you take this protein shakes will help . Also drink  a lot of water. The good thing about it is it kept me focus. I got stuff done unlike some other add medicines that made me just sit there.

I feel more social and talkative (I'm very shy and people always make comments on how I don't talk that much). I don't have as many bad days like I was having before. I still get them but they seem to be more mild and less often. There is a slight come down period when it is wearing off and you can get a little bummed during this time.

Last year, fed up with being so distractible, I got my GP to write me a script for generic methylphenidate.   Walgreens was dispensing the round, very-pale-orange ones marked DAN 20 5884 (I'd name the manufacturer, but with all the takeovers, name changes, and selloffs I haven't a clue who that is.  The pill bottle said Actavis).  It's IR not ER, and at a 20mg@06.00, 10@noon, 10@18.00 regimen worked *wonderfully* for me on a number of levels including focus, T2 obesity reduction, available energy level, and even a good night's sleep. This year, I haven't been able to find a pharmacy that carries the 5884 pill, so I settled for Malinckrodt's Methylin.  My perception is that it's not even close to being therapeutically equivalent.   I perceive it as having an efficacy about 2/3 that of the 5884 one, which is a great disappointment.  The difference is so great that I'll likely file a complaint with the FDA.",0,15

Methylphenidate,"Ive battled terrible anxiety and depression most of my life. Ive also battled with severe ADD. I had tried adderall before Ritalin and adderall made me terribly sick and panicked. For months I was afraid to try another stimulant medication. My psychiatrist suggested I try Ritalin at a low dose to see if it helped. I finally agreed because I wondered if my ADD was causing most of my psychological issues. At first Ritalin was only a little helpful. I still had to get used to using a stimulant, but after a couple months when my body became accustomed to it, I found I needed my dose to be increased, and the higher it was increased the less I needed other antidepressants or anxiety medication like Xanax. I took Xanax for years and it never solved my psychological problems only bandaided them. Ritalin actually gave me control over my thoughts and emotions and took away all my fears. I need a fairly high dose of it (80mg per day) for it to work at its best but I no longer need Xanax.",10,5

Much more so than if he didnt take any medication at all. The effect of the medication when it is exiting his system is not smooth.

Now I'm 21 years old (as of the 12th this month) and for the past years I've been noticing that I've been getting increasingly anxious and worrying more than usual. In the past 5years on a daily 63 mg dose I've been dealing with depression, anxiety, nightmares, insomnia, loss of appetite, and I've lost 30lbs due to that.

Methylphenidate,"Through testing, I was determined to have Adult Attention Deficit Disorder (AADD). I had gotten to the point where I could not read, and reading has been the love of my life since age 6. I'm 70 now. I found it hard to get anything done, hard to remember what I was doing. It's hard to say how much of this was caused by five year abusive relationship, finally ended in Jan 2015. I am now reading like I used to: novels, studies for school, keeping on on world affairs, etc. What a gift! My psychiatrist wants me to continue Ritalin. Past history shows I snowballed into depression without it. I do take her advice, but it makes me so hyper! I have to take xanax to calm down.

As time went on I got more used to the medication and I've since regained my weight (for the most part, I've still got a high metabolism and as a result gaining any kind of weight is difficult for me) and can still focus on my schoolwork. Part of this can be attributed to getting older and all, but I think the medication has certainly helped. For reference, I'm a 6 ft tall guy who weighs around 125 lbs.",0,25

Since I know all ADHD meds have the same side effects I stated, my only real complaint is how it irritates his skin.

Methylphenidate,"<b>Daytrana (methylphenidate):</b>			 Im actually an adult on the patch. I am 28. female. I've been trying to find the right stimulant with bearable side effects since I was in high school. Please excuse the lengthy review I just know the search can be tough and long. I have Depression, ADD, GA &amp; SA, and OCD skin(cuticle) picking tendencies. It's been very hard finding a stimulant that didn't worsen my anxiety related symptoms. I could tolerate 5mg adderrall XR but my body burned through both the XR and IR in about 3 hours. Then I would crash for the rest of the day (depressed, irritable, anxious).  Vyvanse gave me zero motivation and made me calm but in a weird way. For example, I didn't care or worry about anything... I didn't even want to talk to people. I would just want to sit there alone and stare at a wall or something. It was nice to be that relax but too weird. But the real problem was the crash! It was the most extreme of all the stimulants I've tried by far! I took it only twice and threw it out. I almost didn't try Daytrana patch because Ritalin was actually the first stimulant I tried, which was over 10 years ago and I remember similar symptoms to that I had on adderrall. I ended up giving it a try with the logic that it might be smoother since its was for children and I was also desperate since I'm working and study for the GRE. I'm so happy I gave Daytrana a shot!! I'm telling you if you suffer from anxiety, can't tolerate the crashes, and metabolize the other stimulant too fast you have got to try this one!! I've only been on it for a week but I can't believe it! I leave it in for the whole 9 hours and I never crash. In comparison to Adderall is still the best stimulant for getting you motivated, I have to motivate myself a little but unlike adderall I can stay focused ALL day with Daytrana. Im also less likely to do something stimulanty like start reorganizing my closet for no reason but I do get the necessary cleaning, errands, bills etc done effortlessly. And the best part is that it doubles as an anti-depressant since, what I assume is the increased dopamine stays in my system pretty much all day and night. The happiness doesn't feel like a high it feels more like an absence of depression. I don't have anymore of the repetitive negative thoughts. The constant emotions of hopelessness, guilt, embarrassment, you name it, just aren't there anymore. There is still a mild degree of sadness I carry with me but I have major depression so I feel like it's only normal and I can handle that :)!! As far as the negative side effects: Like all the stimulants I've been on I still have the insomnia, loss of appetite, and increase urge to pick at my cuticles at night when it's wearing off. But there is not a crash. no evenings being completely drained of energy, fits of irritation, major anxiety or depression.  Also, the patch is applied to your hip and I'm experiencing some muscle tension in my legs which I think might be slowly subsiding. Im drinking a lot of water and taking vitamins in precaution of cramps.  Advice on taking the patch off- It's easier for me to take it off when it's wet. I do it in the shower/bath or rub it off with a warm wash cloth.  Good luck!",0,98

As soon as this came out, we switched him to Quillivant and he's had great success in managing his ADHD during the day. He starts having trouble at school around 1pm, so it does wear off somewhat, but overall we have been impressed with this medication.

The problem is, I don't take it everyday, I think it's a little bit too harsh for me. I'll go see him again, maybe I have psychological issues.

I like Metadate because by the time he's out from school the medication has warn off and he's back to his normal active self.

However over the past year or so I have been experiencing negative side effects such as depression, headaches, and loss of appetite. I can manage the headaches and appetite problems but as for the depression, it is so bad that I am considering switching to another brand or changing my dose because when I am on Concerta I become virtually emotionless, and as a result I am struggling to maintain good relationships with my friends and family members.",0,65

Right through my senior year I found I didn't need to even study my notes much because, when I took Concerta, I was so focused that I remembered everything said in class on my own.  The main downside taking this as a student is that it wears off by the time you get home, so doing homework seems impossible -- same with studying.  After I graduated high school though, I noticed Concerta started giving me symptoms of depression and worsening my anxiety to an awful point.

I lamented for many, many months about whether or not to have him begin a stimulant. It is obvious that it was the right decision. I make sure he eats a hearty breakfast. He knows he needs to push himself to eat something at lunch and drink plenty of fluids. He did tell me he felt prickles in his head for the first 2 days.

(my doctor said that other parents had noticed that the placement of the patch makes a difference). At school he is able to control his impulses, focus and most importantly still be a 7 year old boy (not a zombie). The only downfalls to this medication is that he does not have an appetite (most of these meds cause this) &amp; the area where you place the patch can get red and itchy.

When he doesn't take this medication he says he can't do any of his work at school so we feel it really benefits him.  He still has a lot of trouble with disorganization and being moody and sometimes aggressive, especially in the evenings when he is coming down off the medicine.

The only side effect she has had is loss of appetite which she now knows to eat a healthy/big breakfast before her medication in the morning. She then eats a normal dinner. She has occasionally had insomnia if she takes her medication later in the morning or if she has accidentally had caffeine.

Methylphenidate,"<b>Daytrana (methylphenidate):</b>			 We just picked up the Daytrana patch tonight and plan to try it in the morning.  My son is 15 and has been on ADD medications since he was 6.  Metidate was awful -- caused anger and dark moods.  We switched to Focalin XR twice a day (which I highly recommend for those of you who are still searching for the right medication) and has been absolutely wonderful for the past 6 or 7 years.  It made him feel loving and gentle, which is his nature.  Just recently, he seemed to outgrow his dosage, and through tests of different dosages, we have reached the max he should take, which, by the way, is usually not what the insurance company limits are, so find a good ADD doctor who knows his stuff. Keep at it until you find the right med and dosage.",0,44

When my parents started me on Ritalin in 3rd grade their only regret was letting me struggle for so long. I was always being sent home from school for playing in the mud, walking out of class, etc. I was talkative and happy, but my grades were well below satisfactory - I had very few teachers encourage me, rather I was written off as a disruption. My first year on medication was hard, I had no appetite and trouble sleeping. After about 6 months all the side effects went away. I could eat and sleep no problem.

Grades were never a problem, but behavior and socialization were. She hated the medication and would spit it out or hide it. It gave her headaches, loss of appetite and sleep loss. Eventually she began taking it regularly and began to do well in school. The behavior problems ceased as well as socialization. She took this medication for about 2 years and then I decided to pull her off. Her teacher didn't even notice and thought she was still taking the medication because she was so well adjusted and presented no serious issues. She never took meds again and learned to cope. She has ADHD but manages it other ways.",0,71

No bipolar but have had add, ptsd, depression and some hypomania. I think methylphenidate has helped me with all these symptoms. I can focus. Do what needs to get done. Clean my apartment. Not sleep 24/7 anymore. I'm calm. And have a much better life. More energy and I'm happy!",10,18
Methylphenidate,<b>Ritalin (methylphenidate):</b>			 Have to say wow!  It helps low energy depression and works well with most SSRIs and some low dose SNRIs.  Life feels exciting again and it offsets SSRI sexual side effects.  Works fast and well.  Main problem is that it wears off in a few hours so you need to dose multiple times a day.  It causes you to sweat a little more and be a little more irritable than usual but it is really a great med to help depression.  It is much different and better than Wellbutrin for sure even though both are NDRI's.  Check out the research on stimulants for depression and bipolar depression.  Going to try Provigil now for a more even energy/mood boost.  But I may be back to this.,0,36

I have control with what I say and I can concentrate when I need to. This is however, no miracle - I have bad days. Like anyone, my cognition suffers if I haven't had enough sleep, etc. Concerta only gives one control of their actions and organizes things in your head a bit better - something I had been long without.

Negatives: if we leave the patch on from 8-6, we are up until 2 or 3 am if we do not give melatonin to help sleep. Appetite severely decreases on medicine, days without medicine he's eating like a horse.

The same diagnosis and suggested treatment followed the next year and the year after by the Psychiatrist who I was referred to.

But, it may have just been me, but after being on Concerta I became very antisocial (the complete opposite of myself) and basically got lost in my head. I also suffer from depression and severe seasonal effective disorder and my first winter taking the Concerta was a horrible experience.

I asked him what he was doing and he told me he was seeing eyes in the bushes and they were all staring back at him. Well I immediately called his pediatrician and had him taken off that day.

I haven't been on this medication like others have and I am experiencing so many side effects...i.e. nervousness, no appetite, headaches in the morning, cant sleep, paranoid for no reason.

I have always been able to compensate because of my intelligence. Writing essays was a pain, because I could never sit down and focus.  I feel that this is a two-edged sword. I felt I was finally able to concentrate on my written work. It works wonders on that respect. But I also feel that the side-effects can be bad, I felt anxious and my heart often started racing. Regular use can reduce this, but I feel bad about relying on meds to lead a normal life. It helps me when I have to do concentrated work, but otherwise I don't take it.",8,2

However, I've been noticing recently that while on the Concerta, I'm moody, tired, and unmotivated.  I also start thinking really negatively about myself, and find myself very irritable.

It almost feels like time moves slower, I don't feel rushed anymore.  People are able to talk to me without me interrupting to blurt out what I was thinking.

Concerta helped me concentrate, but it didn't make me too jittery or not focused enough, and it feels just right. When I came back to the medication, after six months of not taking it, I've had the best school days I've ever had in my life.

We've done therapy (CBT), educational assistance, behavioral plans. His issue is related to impulsive reactions, emotional liability - rather than hyperactivity - while he had always been able to do his work well and finish tasks - he was often tantrumy, would lash out at peers if he didn't get his way or become so overwhelmed emotionally that he would not be able to process the situation rationally.  ALL of the behavioral issues have ceased.",0,38
Methylphenidate,"<b>Ritalin-SR (methylphenidate):</b>			 Our son is 11 yrs old. He is ADHD/non-specific mood disorder. He has been on numerous medication. The last 2 years we have had him on only Abilify and Tenex. We decided at the end of the school year that we would remove all medicines and start fresh because we felt that the medicines were NOT working any longer and puberty was showing it's ugly face. We started Ritalin SR 3 weeks after he stopped getting other medicines. Within 24 hours he had a face tic, 36 hours he could not sit for long periods of time. 48 hours we knew he needed to be removed. We could barely understand him talking, he made us crazy because he could NOT stop moving. He did not feel it, he does not understand that the things he was doing was not normal for him.",0,14
Methylphenidate,"<b>Concerta (methylphenidate):</b>			 I've tried several of the common ADD medications, and Concerta works the best for me. I was on it for two years a few years ago. When I am on this, I produce better work in school and in my job. When I am not on it, my mind has significant difficulty compartmentalizing information, storing it and accessing it when I need it. Often I wouldn't even hear what was being said. This creates major anxiety when I can't think clear enough to get more challenging tasks done. What Concerta also does is makes me hyper- focus on small things like constructing a simple email to send to one person - it'll take me 15 minutes to write the 30 second email because I'm overly focused on my every word.",0,20
Methylphenidate,"<b>Concerta (methylphenidate):</b>			 I am a nineteen year old woman taking Concerta for ADD. It really helps me. I can focus a lot better and I feel a lot more relaxed. My boyfriend and I went from fighting every single day to not fighting at all. It has absolutely worked wonders for me. The only side effects I have had is no appetite and I have lost six pounds in less than a week which I am not complaining about since I am five foot three and weighed 155 pounds beforehand. I have also experienced a terribly dry mouth but my doctor said it should go away when I start my second dose. Overall, I love it and I would recommend it to anyone!",0,23

Within those months my doctor kept putting me on different medicines, none worked. I started school with no medicines, I was on the high honor all, my mom wanted me to take it because I couldn't focus I was so HYPER. So my doctor put me on Concerta again. I have been on and off, but I have been consistent for 1-2 weeks. I have noticed my face is very itchy and blotchy and I want to hide and cry.

We postponed medication until my son was in the 5th grade and grades started plummeting. He is not hyper or misbehaved but has difficulty focusing, completing tasks and becoming overwhelmed.  We tried other medicines, but Daytrana was for us.  No fuss to take medicines.  No sudden drop in mood. No depression.  The only drawback was itchy skin, but he overcame this and difficulty removing the backing, but overtime this becomes easier. I would recommend this. Do not give up on your child.

Benefits are MANY.  Though 9 hours is the recommended time for wearing the patch, my daughter routinely wears them for 14 hours daily to get school work and homework done.  She wears them 16 or more hours if she has a date, or there is a school function that lasts late e.g. PROM.  This has allowed her to avoid those horrible impulse control issues most ADD kids experience.  Daytrana has allowed her to avoid the highs and lows that occur with other medications.

On the 2nd day his teachers sent me notes about how much he had already improved with focusing on his school work and having to spend much less time getting him to pay attention.  He is more focused and hasn't brought work home not completed in class since he started it.

She can tie her shoes for the first time and get dressed without an argument. I'm 38 and was also diagnosed (recommended by her Dr).

I could focus on my work (instead of splitting my attention between my work and drawings or books or video games), and I didn't feel any major side effects.

I lost a lot of my friends and I can't control my thoughts, day dreams and mood swings and my performance at my job declined rapidly to the point where I almost lost it.

However, within the first week of taking it I will feel very moody, have tics, etc. I get excited and anxious easily. In the evenings, it is impossible to concentrate and it gets me often very frustrated or irritable.

Now, let me begin by saying that before the appointment where I was diagnosed, I had just eaten lunch.  Shortly after starting Daytrana, I caught a cold that lasted about two weeks, recovered, then caught another two-week cold.  I did notice that I was less hungry while using the patch.  Didn't eat breakfast before my checkup,  My weight went from 120 to 114 lbs.  Doctor took me off Daytrana and switched me to Stratera, which has been a nightmare.

I am 58 years and believe this medicine is the first ADD medication that I have noticed is truly effective.  It has helped my concentration and increased the length of time I work without any distractions.  As some others have commented, some passion has been removed as a trade-off in of efficiency in work and a greater degree of focus.

Because of this, I suffered depression and lack of self esteem because I thought others were better or smarter than me.

I switched to 70 mg of Vyvanse once a day and it lasts all day long. The side effects are very minimal and it doesnt affect my appetite or social skills. There is no high and no crash. Adderall made me very aware that I was on medication, whereas Vyvanse is much less intense and has a very smooth feeling.",10,38
Vyvanse,Both my daughter and I take Vyvanse for ADD/ADHD. It has helped us significantly. My daughter initially tried Biphentin but it did not help her symptoms and caused her not to eat or sleep. With Vyvanse there is a dramatic improvement of her symptoms and less side effects. It just suppresses her appetite. We take her off occasionally to help her appetite and have also tried a short acting formulation  that she takes after breakfast and again after lunch so her appetite isnt as effected.  I experience very good results on Vyvanse as well (and dont mind curbing my appetite slightly).,10,16
Vyvanse,"My (unprofessional) advice is to take positive reviews from people who have taken this drug for a short time with a very large grain of salt.  Vyvanse is basically a legal amphetamine and the body takes time to react to it and eventually builds tolerance to it.  The Vyvyanse Crash is real, in  my experience, as many others have observed.  This often leads to patients continually upping their dosages.  As for ADD and ADHD, it is interesting that both have become epidemics in the U.S., but not in Europe.  I believe this is because in the US of the massive profitability pharmaceutical experience in developing new drugs for every affliction.  That is just my opinion.  Regular exercise and diet are natural ways to address depression, ADD, ADHD and other conditions.  Common sense, but the pharma companies can't profit from it.  Everyone's physiology is different, so give Vyvance a try.  I hope it helps you.",5,29
Vyvanse,Only just started after 4 months off all ADHD drugs. After a week of being on the Vyvanse 30 mg with not to much to write home about I up it to 60 mg and I have felt that I am a lot less sociable than I usually am. Has a smoother take off and landing but not as affective as dexies. I think if they could somehow combine the two drugs as one I would have the perfect prescription.,6,8

Vyvanse,It works but nowhere near the 1012 hours advertised. I get 5 hours out of my Vyvanse dose. And an hour of that is waiting for it to kick in. Ive read an enzyme in your body has to convert this medicine into its active form and if you have too much of this enzyme or if youre a  fast metabolizer  then one could have my experience. Im switching to Dexedrine Spansules 2-3 times a day as Im a Realtor and need full-day coverage.,3,24
Vyvanse,"I was on Adderall for about 10 years. Then doctor switched me to Vyvanse because the side effects were apparently less. Spent roughly 7 years on Vyvanse. The med works in the matter because it's a stimulant, but the side effects make your life much worse. I began isolating, and began experiencing bi polar behaviors. I would drink alcohol to the point where I passed out because I couldn't sleep otherwise, and eventually became an opiate addict because it would actually take the edge off. I know that is not probably a very common result but it is not unheard of. I felt like I was not in control of myself. Heart rate and blood pressure goes up, weight goes down. Do not put children on this medicine. Finally I stopped all ADHD meds when I got clean, and actually learned how to USE MY ADHD TO MY ADVANTAGE.  I have a daughter. I am sure someone will want to diagnose her as ADHD at some point but I will never ever let my children be put on stimulants.",2,29

He was just having trouble focusing in school he told me and though it would be a good idea. He is a very intelligent young man. When he came to me with his issue we went and saw the doctor right away. Like so many stories I have heard he started out okay, then the chest pains, irritability etc. I thought he was just making excuses about going to school. Then I saw him try to put his shoes on one day. Like he was in slow motion. He then developed a tic. We stopped the meds right away. Doctor says it could've been anything that caused it! Family genetics even!! They say he can get prescribed something for the tics. Great! What will happen then??",1,17
Vyvanse,"It works well, some of the reviews on here are just strange. One of them being someone was taking this for depression and they complained it didn't work?

Vyvanse,"Vyvanse did not feel like Adderall at all. It didn't feel like a stimulant. I just felt really weird, and could not imagine that they used to treat the same condition!",1,15
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse made me feel like I had dementia; I kept forgetting words &amp; could barely form sentences. Im only 32, so it was frustrating &amp; overwhelming to feel like I was losing all my brain cells. I am NOT an emotional person but I would start crying during work &amp; normal situations, which was embarrassing. I felt socially awkward, withdrew into myself, became very passive &amp; lost my confidence. Id fall down the rabbit-hole online &amp; accomplish little more than 12 hours of research on topics which have nothing to do with my life. I also became winded &amp; dizzy every time I stood up, which may have also been due to my weight dropping from 100 to 86 lbs while I was on it. Lastly, my vision was absurdly blurry going from 20/20 to 20/60...that wasnt listed as a side effect at the time, so I thought I was going blind until it subsided after stopping Vyvanse. Overall, Id say its great for weight loss but horrible for mental cognition.",1,30
Vyvanse,"This medication is really messing with my head. I'm popping vyvanse once every morning. I started on 30mg and I did feel the improvement I felt motivated, active and less impulsive. After a month it started to feel like nothing. I felt like it had no effect on me. I saw my psychiatrist and he prescribed me 50mg to try out this month. It's been 2 days and already noticed no improvements. It makes me feel depressed, dehydrated and makes me get angry very easily like one small thing annoys  me  like I want to knock someone out. I noticed tonight that people are having trouble understanding me like I speak normal and people tell me they dont understand me. My focus hasnt improved since I started taking meds again. It only improved for a few days and since the meds changed up my personality and is making me worse its even getting me into trouble at work behaviour wise. I dont recommend this medication whatsoever",3,30
Vyvanse,"I am  50 year old woman with ADHD in addition to mild OCD. I was prescribed Vyvanse for  focus and motivation at a high stress job.

Six months later and It is still helpful with motivation and confidence. That said, I now get too focused on details, and by evening am anxious, irritable and dont want to do anything. I have a hard time waking up. I tried on the weekend to not take it and had terrible depression, anger and crying. I ended up taking it to function. It has started causing anxiety, Im too talkative, and procrastinate tasks I dislike. I am antisocial after work. Without it  I am emotional and want to sleep all day. I tried 5 mg Adderall IR in late afternoon but that caused me to stay up late and could barely get up. It was so helpful at first but now Im worried and am trying to wean off.",4,33
Vyvanse,There are some days it works to its fullest and when I come down from it Im great. There are other days where it doesnt really work and I get really sad and moody and my emotions are all over the place. Its really really inconsistent. Also no matter what it makes my heart beat pretty fast.,6,23
Vyvanse,"Since I can remember, I have always had trouble concentrating or keeping a straight thought in my head.  Grades were always so-so cause you could forget trying to sit down and read a book or study.  Out like a light, zzzzzz.  Fast forward to turning 40 and I start traveling for work.  By 2PM everyday, it's like someone pulled the plug on me and I'm running in quicksand.  Literally feels like Vaseline over your eyes.  Finally went to the Dr and said something has to give.  He started me on 30MG.  It was a complete gamechanger.  Felt like I had a turbo installed.  Brain worked like never before.  Computer work, no problem.   Read a book all day.  Best part, it didn't interrupt my sleep.  We tried various other ADHD medicine and I got the anxiety and buzzing effects from Ritaline and Adderall.  This was a life changer for me.",0,47
Vyvanse,"NOT FOR KIDS, during my experience, (I quit it), I felt like I didn't even have control over me, I felt like a robot. Then I was real silly when I came back home. Now I'm on Concerta.",1,10
Vyvanse,I started my son on Vyvanse per doctors orders and it wasn't for  a few months before both my son and I started to see some major problems. It made him have extreme stomach pain everyday. It made his behavior withdrawn and angry. He did not like it at all and I'm glad we took him off before any long term problems occurred.  STAY AWAY from his medicine. The worst part was that our doctor insisted we stay on it and refused to change his rx. So we found s new doc asap,1,13
Vyvanse,"Don't let ANY healthcare provider start you or your child's dosing on Vyvanse above the 10 mg capsule I switched from Adderall XR 30 mg to Vyvanse 70 mg back in June since Adderall XR 20 mg didn't work long enough for the days in my week Over the course of 5 months of trying different dosages, I've learned when I ingest an amphetamine product that is too strong, I feel sleepy yet become unable to sleep while it's in effect.  Vyvanse starts working about 45 minutes after ingestion and continues raising in your blood stream for about 2 hrs after it starts working. If you feel good at first, but then notice that it makes you feel oddly more tired, kinda like a zombie, or puts you in a state of emotional lability, you are overdosing and feeling the side effects of the most potent medication for ADHD on the market currently due to it's long lasting time I switched back to Adderall XR 20 mg recently, but would go back to Vyvanse again as soon as I hear of a 15 mg capsule being put out.",5,20
Vyvanse,"This medication gave me sudden pains on my chest.  made my heart beat faster at times. I would not recommend it for children. I am a healthy individual, if you are a parent pay close attention to your child symptoms.",1,20
Vyvanse,"When I started my treatment with Vyvanse for ADD, it was a blessing: for the first time I felt motivated to do great at school and have better grades because I had never felt so focused and clear minded in my life, after years of unsuccessful treatments with Ritalin, Concerta and Aradix. But that's what happens to everyone when they're first introduced to Vyvanse, it fixes your entire life and then suddenly and surprisingly it ruins it in new ways. It's been little more than a year since I started taking it, and it didn't take much long for the bad effects of it to hit me: every time I consume this drug I get depressed, I feel empty and anxious, my head hurts and I lose all my motivation because the sadness it brings is stronger than any other positive effect it is intended to give its users. I have never been this depressed in my life, and I blame this drug for that, I mostly (if not only) feel this way when I'm on it.",5,29
Vyvanse,"Ive heard so many stories of this drug triggering personality disorders in people. My parents made me take in high school for a few years and I was so depressed for those years. It made me act weird. It caused facial tics that I still have to this day and cant seem to get rid of even being off of the medication for 7 years. I was 95 lbs when I started taking vyvanse and lost 8 lbs after taking it for 2 weeks. I recently started taking it again for binge eating and immediately felt the depression start by the end of the first day, didnt take it the next day and still felt depressed. Taking it in school, I got a stimulant high for ~an hour or a few hours depending on the dose, but after it wore off I lost all motivation to work, socialize, exercise, etc. I couldnt fall asleep most of the time. This is my experience with vyvanse and it may not relate to everyone but I wouldnt recommend this drug and cant believe its still legally being prescribed, especially to kids.",1,19
Vyvanse,"Ive been on 70mg for a short time and find I dont notice a difference at all in my ADHD. They say it takes about 2 hours to start working but by the fourth hour Im ready for bed. Also, Im constantly hungry taking Vyvanse and its the kind of hunger I cant seem to satisfy. Vyvanse is not covered by my insurance and is $286 for a 30 day supply with GoodRX &amp; Shire coupon. Reading the reviews I was hopeful that this would do the trick but not even close.",1,13
Vyvanse,Vyvanse ruined my skin. It caused lesion type sores around my ears and down my neck. Its been a month Ive been off of it and I havent gotten any new ones but the scars left behind are awful. If I knew how to submit a photo I would,1,6
Vyvanse,"My son used various stimulants for years for ADHD and ODD since 6 yrs old (and he's an Aspie)... Concerta, Daytrana patch, etc. Now 13 and on Vyvanse for 3+ years, it is the BEST meds he's had since it is so smooth and works.  WE LOVE IT!  He is still struggling because of impulsiveness &amp; high metabolism, so the docs added non-stimulants.  We added Clonidine IR for wake-up and bedtime.  For the last 9 months he's had a chronic cough - ENT, Pulmonologist, Allergist, and Gastro docs say everything is fine, so it must be a tic.  We will be taking him off the Vyvanse during Christmas break to confirm that is the case, but know chronic cough could be related to stimulants and Vyvanse (do a web search), otherwise I would give it a 10-10-10!!!.",9,8
Vyvanse,"My wife has been on this for years.  As a husband, I personally hate it. It make her not be herself..  When she comes off of it she comes very defensive and aggressive.  While it works for focus it tunes out all else that matters in life.  I call the drug a relationship killer. It runs her so her on speed during the day while on it. When she comes down on at night and weekends. Stay away...It has taken her to being a completely different person than I know and care about..",1,28
Vyvanse,"Took 60mg Vynase for my ADD along with 30mg of Prozac for depression and there was a poor interaction which caused arm and leg tremors, and some facial twitches.  This also led to me being prescribed Parkinson's medicine.  The Vyvanse itself seemed to help with mental clarity and focus, but wasn't worth it for the physical muscle tremors and grinding my jaw a ton.",3,12
Vyvanse,My 16 year old was diagnosed a month ago apparently with ADHD  He put on 5mg dexis twice a day  But was having a slump around 4 Dr put him on Vyvanse. He was on them for a week  Then his rages started  From his head going thru walls and his fist to not being able to function at all  I took him off them after a week of use  Now 3 weeks down the track and many visits to drs hospitals mental health teams and psychiatrist my son still rages at the slightest thing and once has heard voices in his head  He wasnt like this when he first started these horrid meds  I wouldnt recommend to anyone  But I do understand everyone is different  And my son has had a bad experience  But I had a mentally healthy 16 year old 2 months ago  Now he is close to being put in a psych unit,1,17
Vyvanse,"I started taking this after being diagnosed with a depressive disorder, GAD, and ADHD while in a short stay at the mental hospital for kids. before this I was so smart, but I couldnt stop talking. I would constantly get in trouble for not staying quiet and I wouldnt do the best on my tests just because I couldnt pay attention. As a young girl they just said these symptoms were because of puberty and my severe ADHD went unnoticed until I was 15 and failing all my classes. After taking vyvanse (started at 30mg and increased until 60mg where Im at now) my grades went from Cs, Ds, and the occasional B to all Bs and As in a month. It suppressed my appetite but that helps me with binging due to my ADHD. This medication works well, but the insomnia for the first week was hard. melatonin worked well to fight that.",10,18
Vyvanse,"I honestly can't tell the difference. I started on 20 mg but only for about 10 days and I've been doing 40 mg ever since. It wears off way too quickly and I'm not even sure if its working,  although it does make it easier for me to start things and be more productive doing them occasionally. I've adjusted to the crash better but I still feel effects of depression irritation and energy that comes and goes.",4,13
Vyvanse,"Honestly. I have unbearable ADHD that I have never treated in my 30 years of life. Finally took action 6 weeks ago - vyvanse. 40mgs morning for the last 6 weeks. Now I am also fine tuning with 20mgs 12pm due to SEVERE CRASHING causing me to slur my words because of how bad the drowsiness is. I told my doc I have also had diarrhea for 4 WEEKS, apparently it's anxiety causing this. I am so depressed. I had my first nervous breakdown ever during week 2, I feel disassociated - like I am seeing my memories as someone else's. I have lost 25 POUNDS in the 6 weeks. I feel nauseous, can't get up in the morning, headaches, INCESSANT thinking. So many cons. Only pro is that I am less impulsive. That's it. My quality of life is even worse now. Everything seemed great the first week though. Will try taking 20mgs in the morning like week 1. If this doesn't work, getting a new doc that actually listens to me.",1,18
Vyvanse,Omg where do I start. I hate it. I'd rather go to hell and burn for eternity than to ever take this medicine again. Its been so bad for me every day,1,14
Vyvanse,"I was prescribed Vyvanse in high school for ADD. I always had a really hard time paying attention in class and vyvanse helped a lot. My grades went up and school work became easy. However there were various bad side effects. Extremely dry mouth, weight loss, trouble sleeping, and the worst of all mood swings. During the day I would be fine and very productive however at night when it started to wear off I would get extremely depressed and even at times have increased really dark thoughts. They call this  vyvanse crash  and it is no joke. This became a big problem. I loved vyvanse because I was able to get so much done but the mood swings made it unbearable. I am now a college student and no longer take vyvanse consistently. It is great for concentration problems and ADD but be beware of the dosage of the vyvanse and the possible side effects that may occur. There are also studies that show it can be very addicting.",6,24
Vyvanse,"I have anxiety, depression, OCD, and PTSD. Vyvanse took care of my Depression, anxiety, and PTSD. My straight D GPA skyrocketed to a straight 99% in every single class. Im in the masters program now and my life has flipped a 180. Im a functional, HAPPY adult",10,52
Vyvanse,"Firstly if any doctor tries to start you or your child off at 50mg or 70 mg get a new doctor. This stuff is strong I started at 30mg which is recommended. It was still to intense and I had to open the pill and take 2/3 I have been off and on ADHD meds since I was 6 years old (30 years ago). Today at 30mg was great more focus and motivation all day. It affected my sleep the first 2 weeks which made it not as effective. Getting enough sleep is key to it not making you anti social and depressed.  Lime in orange juice before bed helped think acidic . 3 weeks in sleep normalized. I feel great have more focus, drive, less anxiety, and a lot more patience. Does not have the push that Adderall has but the push comes at a cost.",8,20
Vyvanse,"Started at 20mg, then 30mg, then 40mg now back to 30mg.  After taking Adderal this is a wonder drug.  Smooth on the upswing and even less noticeable on the down swing.  Has changed my life.  Able to be productive again, anxiety gone, talk to people, sense of purpose.  Seeing a head doc that doesnt believe in medicine.  So get my meds from another doc.  Head doc noticed a difference right away after got dosage dialled.  Fairly new couple months on this med been trying others for 2 years without luck.  Hopefully this is the one.",10,17
Vyvanse,"Ive been on vyvanse daily for the past 8 years (recently, my doctor has added 10mg of Zenzedi in the afternoon). Vyvanse has truly been a godsend for my ADHD. I also have anxiety, which  causes even menial tasks to seem unbearable. With Vyvanse, daily life tasks are not only easier to complete, they are easier to begin.  Prior to Vyvanse, I tried Ritalin and Focalin (gave me horrible anxiety and agitation), Strattera caused me to lose an unhealthy amount of weight, adderall gave me headaches and plunged me into a depression as it would wear off.",10,15
Vyvanse,Just got diagnosed with ADHD. I was put on vyvanse 50mg on the spot. I am now suffering from crippling depression - made me awful and not want to be around anyone. DO NOT RECOMMEND,1,18
Vyvanse,"So I started on Vyvanse30mg a day after being diagnosed with ADHD at 26 after living with depression and anxiety for many years, had many attempts on my life and yeah some dark times. Then I met a doctor who was a ADHD specialist and she diagnosed me withing a couple of weeks. I'm now on 50mg twice a day (so 100mg daily) but I would like to say that this saved my life and it has improved my mood, my mental health and my adhd traits..",9,22
Vyvanse,Amazing,10,7
Vyvanse,"I was prescribed 30mg Vyvanse for ADD and chronic fatigue.  I does help a lot with concentration but I've noticed I'm more emotional, almost as if I'm on my period.  I cry easily and less tolerant of the some people in my life.  My appetite has also increased considerably.  I've taken dexedrine in the past that was a lot more tolerable and just as effective for focusing.",5,5
Vyvanse,Not close to the focus and retention required for even getting out of bed for me. No motivation to do anything. Just awake and heart beat is fast. Anxiety is intermediate and depression is excruciating regularly this puts icing on the cake. Adderall had a worse crash but I had better days socializing and suffering in silence then now.,4,8
Vyvanse,"I'm going to start with the negatives then positives in regards to vyvanse. When i first started taking this medication the side effects were less than desirable! Anxiety, agitation, palpitations, unable to socialize all horrible for day to day living. BUT - as my doctor told me - you have to find the dose thats right for you and you have to let your body adjust to the medication. Well holy moly! Once you find the right dose that works for you, it's like a whole new world! Motivation, sense of wellbeing, able to focus on day to day tasks. This has been an absolute MIRACLE and has changed my life ten fold. I encourage anyone who starts taking vyvanse to give it a fair chance, let your body adjust, and try to find what dose works best for you. Because when you do find it, you'll be functioning on a whole new level! Cheers",10,66
Vyvanse,I have ADHD and am 62 yrs. old. I have been on this medication for 7 weeks. The last 4 weeks I have had sinus issues. I have found a small percentage can get sinusitis. It is bad enough I take it for 2 days and the 3rd day I don't take anything. And I feel the difference. If it wasn't for the sinus issues I would continue taking it,8,6
Vyvanse,"I had taken Vyvanse for many years and was slowly on the decline. I was deeply depressed and had an absolute hopeless and helpless outlook on life with no relief. I had psychosis, delusions and impulsive behavior which I never had. I began having issues with memory, thinking, reasoning, decision making, tasks, and  concentration.  I would become very agitated if being interrupted. I was very aggressive and agitated constantly, it was at least 98% of the time in 10 years.  I read horror stories about stimulants, namely the Amphetamine line of them. I subsequently tapered off of them and feel 100% better than before. I have no depressive symptoms, delusions, memory problems, agitation or aggressiveness. I was not happy with life and my personal relationships were very toxic. I wasted almost 10 years of my life feeling like this and have other personal complications that resulted from the use of these toxic drugs.",1,20
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse has been an up and down experience. First taking it, it upset my stomach that went away after a few week. The first week were very emotionally happy. I felt like I stepped into life for the first time. But everyday at 2pm my ADHD would start returning. As time went on 2pm went from just ADHD to ADHD, extreme irritability, BAD headaches and nearly nonfunctional.  My doctor upped my dose but that did nothing. Currently waiting for my next appointment to switch medications.  If it actually lasted even just 8 hours I would stay on it. Its truly is life changing for 4-5hours lol symptom free 4-5hours isn't worth how I feel during what they call the crash.",6,15
Vyvanse,"Concerta gave insidious side effects of plummeting self esteem and extreme suicidal ideation as medication decreased effectiveness over time and dose has to be increased. (However, it did help with procrastination and getting stuff done.) The horrible thing is that my son had similar effects and was trying to choke himself when he felt that he hadnt performed well. It is so hard to know when you are in it that the medication is causing the symptoms. Now both of us are on 20mg Vyvance. Some occasional SI on my part, mild and very intermittent. Im also on Vybrid for GAD and he is on buspirone. Im not sure Im actually getting things done...I have an project Im anxious about Im just not doing it and Im on 40mg now. I might be irritable in the evenings.  My husband and I are wondering if the medications are worth it...I guess these are long term issues and the medications effectiveness wax and wane.",8,6
Vyvanse,"I was on vyvanse 30MG for 5 months it was the best time of my life. Succeeding in school. Succeeding in soccer and being really social while on it. Coming off it wasnt that bad as I pretty much just went everyday then just decided to quit because I was so confident that I  didnt need the drug to do what I was doing. About a month later I lost all my confidence as my ADHD really brought down my confidence when I started falling behind in school and wasnt quite as social. I feel this drug does help with social anxiety which I also have. Strongly thinking about going back on it and I havent taking it in 2 years just not sure yet. Some side effects I did notice was agitation, loss of appetite, and abnormally emotional.",7,21
Vyvanse,I have a serious condition of ADD. I've had it since childhood. The doctors prescribed Vyvanse 70 mg for me to take. I kept wondering why the medicine was not working because one of my children had to take the same thing and it worked for him. I found out that the pharmacy has been giving me fake medicine! If anyone has any suggestions on what I can do please let me know. I did tell the FDA about it. Hopefully they do something soon.,1,14
Vyvanse,I tried Ritalin was horrible suffered ups and downs in mood and impulsiveness and severe anxiety to which I was hospitalised.  Dr switched me to Vyvance and anxiety went immediately. No crashes in mood and feel sharp and no longer lose anything. Also I feel I now have a larger emotional range and more empathy for others than horrid Ritalin. Vyvanse is the future new drug which should be tried as first option as in UK rather than old 1950's med Ritalin.,10,21
Vyvanse,"My son was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Vyvanse (I think only because it was covered by Medicaid) but he is so angry and everything sets him off into a fit of rage which didn't happen when on Evekeo 10mg.  Through the clinic nurse I found out that it is available for  a lower copay now too so the Psych Dr has prescribed; thankfully our son and our family environment is much more peaceful as we have our son back to his caring, cheerful self. I do not recommend Vyvanse!",1,12
Vyvanse,"Hey guys! So I have been using stimulants to treat ADHD for about 9 years on and off. I love the feelings of motivation, effective working, and productivity! It takes about 30 mins to kick in for me  and I found it intriguing that they kick in time varies from person to person. Although,  it only lasts for about 4 to 5 hours and after that timeframe I become extremely irritated and slightly emotional. I take 70 mgs in the morning, and after reading the forum, Ive come to the conclusion that this reaction is probably due the amount that Ive been taking. Good luck all!",7,13
Vyvanse,Zyprexa and Prozac for bipolar depression. 60mg Vyvanse for ADHD. Helpful but may need to increase to max dose of 70mg. I agree with the person who said he or she wished they could take it twice a day. Very smooth drug without excessive excitement or anxiety. Adderall XR is stronger than Vyvanse but the anxiety crash isn't worth it.,9,13
Vyvanse,My whole entire school career I would pay attention to the teacher and listen and listen and just didnt get it like the other kids did. I wished every day that I could just be like all the normal kids and just some how be able to do my school work and pass tests. That was until 7th grade when I was prescribed Vyvanse 70mg once daily in the morning. IMMEDIATELY after that I started passing EVERY class with As and Bs (prior to being held back once in 2nd grade and every other grade after that getting the lowest possible grades almost failing every time) by 8th grade the school put me in honors classes. In 9th grade after 4 or 3 whatever years of taking Vyvance I joined my schools NJROTC program and joined drill teams. Things I would have NEVER been able to accomplish without the Vyvanse treating my ADHD. I recommend this medication highly. Not every medication works for everyone but this one works PERFECTLY for me.,10,44
Vyvanse,"I switched from adderall to vyvanse 4 months ago.  I appreciate that Vyvanse requires an only 1 per day remembrance to take your medication.  For me, it hasn't resulted in any crash or high.  Consistent temperament and focus are experienced throughout my day.  I started at 50mg and felt sluggish and terribly unmotivated.  My doctor said I could half the dose, which has been a VAST improvement. With quieter thoughts, I'm sleeping through the night and some forethought has reduced the do it RIGHT NOW behavior.",10,19
Vyvanse,"It works for about six hours, then it stops. I want to take it twice a day but insurance will only pay for once daily.",8,10
Vyvanse,Started on 20mg and now up to 60mg. No more intrusive thoughts and constant daydreaming. Wiped it all the way.,9,16
Vyvanse,"The first day I tried 10 mg of Vyvanse was amazing.  I had embarked on cleaning out our basement and noticed that I was getting a lot done without going around in circles like I normally do. Because of this I immediately thought I'd finally found the right drug for me. For the first week or two, it seemed I had. The downsides: For some reason, Vyvanse does not seem to help me regulate my emotions at all. I've been on Adderal, Ritalin, and dexedrine and all of those medications really inhibit my negative reactions to things that I find frustrating.  Vyvanse does nothing for this--bad drivers still make me crazy on Vyvanse. The other thing I've noticed, is by the end of the day, I am multitasking and talking people's ear off as if I am on something. I actually started to worry that people might think I was on cocaine--and I'm only taking 10 mil! It would be great if I could find a medication that was something in between this and the longer acting dexedrine.",6,24
Vyvanse,"When 2 months ago my psychiatrist wanted me to try this in lieu of adderall, I declined; however, impulse-driven behavior brought me to a desperate enough point to agree to it.      Although the trial is only 10 days underway and it stinks that it takes 2 hours to experience effects, I'm overall very pleased with the outcomes of this medication.  Compared to Adderall's effects, this medication imparts morning to evening evenness in mood and attention. For me the peaks and lulls have been replaced with overall calm. It does seem to be a little too calming, but that may be because my brain has adapted itself to chaos. Even if that doesn't diminish with time, I'd prefer that to crazy.",9,23
Vyvanse,"In Switzerland is called Elvanse. I looked for a real specialist psychiatry for my ADHD which is very strong, I can't stay sit for 2 minutes, when  sitting my legs shakes so much, when I stay up, I walk everywhere without knowing where I'm going, once or twice a week I take the wrong train and end my travel anywhere..I get stressed for anything, I loose my mobile monthly, also my keys, my wallet, and so many things I lost. I have real strong ADHD disorder, sometimes I get so stress I get panic attack.  Well with Vyvanse alot of my symptoms have  gone now, I have maybe have 15% of ADHD .But my doctor has to prescribe me 210mg Vyvanse/day, I get for example 70mg at midnight to be able to sleep. If I don't take it I walk all night around my house and  I  have nightmares. With Vyvanse at night I sleep in one time and don't have nightmarres anymore....Well I could say more things but think its enough and don't have patience for it sorry Best regards",10,16
Vyvanse,Was put on this medication senior year. I was an C student but after I was put on Vyvanse 60mg got straight As the whole year. I enjoyed going to school! The only thing I dont like about this medication is you get a very dry month. And you feel like you have to constantly be doing something or you feel like a mad man. Also the comedown in the beginning is awful. Midday I felt like a zombie and didnt have an emotion,6,18
Vyvanse,"I am an Adult and I started Elvanse/Vyvanse  30mg about a week ago and so far the only effects I've noticed are slightly increased hyperactivity and being more active on social media. I wanted meds for my ADHD to survive university and unless the higher doses have more of an effect, this is not the one for me.",5,11
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse is more effective, longer lasting, and has less side effects than taking Adderall IR several times a day. Feels very smooth, and doesn't have much of a comedown. Anxiety is supposedly a side effect, but it actually seems to reduce my anxiety. In my experience: Vyvanse is the best, then Adderal and lastly Ritalin",9,19
Vyvanse,Vyvanse is great if you need it for work but if you need to focus or read and comprehend it is not the right drug. For me it took 2-4 hours before it actually made a difference in focus making it a big no from me! Adderal XR is what I was given to replace Vyvanse and I'll just say that Adderal XR works and it doesn't make me feel horrible like Vyvanse did,0,7
Vyvanse,"I was on Vyvanse 60mg after taking 25mg Adderall XR with a 10mg booster. At first I LOVED Vyvanse. I had no incredible highs or lows. Concentration was great but I had to be reminded to eat and drink. Then I would get so focused on tasks that I couldn't do anything else unless I finished them. Extreme tunnel vision. My mood started shifting and got depressed; not in the I'm so down feeling, but more of a lack of high in the day - almost zombie-like. It ripped all the love out of me and made everything a business decision. Increased apathy. I switched to Adzynes and hope to get back to me.",5,16
Vyvanse,"I was diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD (resulting in extreme panic attacks) about 7 years ago. I went down the line, starting with antidepressants, then Adderall and, finally, Vyvanse. I had a hard time with Adderall as I felt the jolt after taking it daily, even with XR and I broke out with these horrible cyst-like pimples. My psychologist had heard of Vyvanse and recommended changing. I started with a low dose of 20mg.. And finally ended up with 60mg XR daily. It has been life-changer for me. I take one pill first thing in the morning and that's all she wrote ?. I haven't had a panic attack since I started them. My Dr. encourages me to go on drug holidays monthly, which keeps me from going up in dosage. I will say, if you go without them longer than about 5 days, there are the side effects of dry mouth and tension headaches which reside by day 3. Good luck and I do recommend for ADHD!!",10,34
Vyvanse,I starting vyvance 20mg two ago and I was having a big crash in the afternoon. My doctor decided to increase my dose 40mg. For the next 3 weeks I was wonderful but now I'm really depressed and anxious. I don't know if it is normal or not.,5,12
Vyvanse,"I have been on Concerta almost all my life, but last year my mental health got uncontrollable. I got prescribed Prozac which I eventually got the right dose. But when I found the right dose I started to take Concerta again, I had dropped it during the summer. My depression got worse.  So my doctor prescribed me to a non stimulant ADHD drug which didn't work at all. So my psychiatrist this time prescribed me Vyvanse. Vyvanse didn't work at first, but after a while it did. Until my appetite went up, I know that's weird normally your appetite goes down. The doctor gave me a higher dose, and my appetite went back to normal but my concentration wasn't as good as it was. So he increased it one last time. I can concentrate so well, that I can work from 8 am- 9 pm non-stop. The only downfall is my appetite is almost gone. I concentrate all day that I don't take breaks. I can do my assignments, though. I think, the benefits outweighs the loss of appetite.",8,16
Vyvanse,"I have been on Elvanse 30mg for 1 week now. Since I also suffer with anxiety / depression for which I have been taking pregabalin for a number of years. When I 1st took Elvanse (along with my pregabalin) I have to say the response has been quite remarkable, almost life changing. I feel more focused, more motivated, more patient. I don't do things impulsively any more and I feel happy. However, I do think there must be some interaction between the 2 drugs as one day I didn't take my pregabalin just to see how I would feel. Well it was awful, but taking the two drugs together has been great. I do have side effects such as slight nausea, but my appetite is OK, my sleeping isn't great which it wasn't in the first place! The SE I can manage and are an acceptable pay off for the reduction in symptoms.",8,6
Vyvanse,Vyvanse will make you concentrate BUT it will make you feel emotionally terrible. The 1st day I started taking Vyvanse it was incredible. I went out and mowed my lawn which I havent done in months and I got all of my work done. But at Day 2 I was deeply depressed. Ive never felt so low in my whole life. Its not worth being deeply depressed just so you can be more productive. I will never take this drug again in my entire life,5,24
Vyvanse,"I got prescribed this because Methylphenidate was too short acting for me. I take 20 mg in the mid day, and it lasts until evening, I will up it to 30 mg soon. Works well for studying, but makes me feel asocial and sometimes it  gives me bouts of dizziness. It also gives me quite a crash at times, feels like I am hungover and my ADHD symptoms becomes worse than prior to taking the meds. All in all its worth it for me so far, because it gives me the motivation to actually sit down and study for my exams. Which is alpha, omega for my future.",7,8
Vyvanse,"Have been taking Vyvanse 70mg for over 4 years now, started at 50mg, then 60mg, then up to 70mg. The initial 60mg dose made me feel icky, little nauseated and like my head was rattling, the side effects soon subsided. I lost 15-20 lbs the first 1-2 years I took it but since have gained that weight back and maintained. Vyvanse definitely makes me more functional day to day. I tried Adderall IR and Adderall XR prior to this on several different dosages and did not do good at all, the XR was a little better but could not find the right dose, constantly felt bad and out of it, with Adderall the more I tried to take I got extremely drowsy and couldn't function. I'll stick with my Vyvanse, it remains consistent.",9,23
Vyvanse,"Its like cocaine or crack and makes you feel great. This is going to outweigh any negative side effects for pretty much ANYONE, regardless if you have a diagnosis of ADHD or not. Im  37 years old and have been prescribed both Ritalin and Adderall as a youth for ADHD. Dont fool yourselves into thinking you cant function without drugs. Thats exactly what the mental health care system is duping you all to believe. Pathetic. Not going facilitate or encourage enablement of this kind of mentality. Just because its presc doesnt make it ok. Lobotomies used to be prescribed too.",1,23
Vyvanse,"Taken Vyvanse for ADHD for 4 years- amazing! 30mg at 5am and 30mg at 2pm on my 12hour shift, never on weekends. I am a 35yr old otherwise healthy female. Initial weight loss from 140 to 130 but stopped there. Never tired, clear thinking. I have to do remember to drink water because my job involves a lot of talking and dry mouth is huge and sometimes sweating (learned to wear tee shirts and dress lighter). Recently decided to take time off because I wonder about long term effects but I think after four years Ive lost many of the natural strategies I developed and was much more all over the place than I remember in university... very frustrating so I started again. I will always take med breaks though because I dont want to develop tolerance- also love my many qualities of having ADHD. Ive read a lot of comments about pains, aches, and emotions- not experienced this in four years... everyone is so different and what works for some just dont for others.",9,37
Vyvanse,Have had a very positive experience with Vyvance for both ADHD and overeating.  I have been able to focus and concentrate much easier and dont try to tackle 10 things at once and then leave things undone.,9,28
Vyvanse,"Doctor switched me from Adderall to Vyvanse. Im on highest dosage of Vyvanse and no effect! Zero concentration and tired all the time. Stomach pulsating, sweating and scary other side effects. I get confused about what Im doing and am completely unproductive. Adderall works great. Vyvanse doesnt work at all and Im concerned about the crazy side effects",1,22
Vyvanse,While it worked for my ADHD it did force me into a corner on antidepressants and I was ready to finish it after about a month,7,8
Vyvanse,"I was diagnosed with ADHD last year and was not put on vyvanse until a year later because no other medicines worked. Started out with 20 mg and the effects were immediate, I was able to apply and get accepted to my colleges of choice and have seen a significant improvement in my grades. I strongly recommend monitoring your heart rate when starting to make sure you dont have palpitations (I did due to my use of caffeine and anxiety problems). Overall strongly recommend vyvanse as long as you take it early in the morning and avoid the use of other stimulants.",10,31
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse is a great alternative to Adderall XR.  I don't experience any of the highs, which is awesome, just better focus and feeling more grounded.  It is more costly for me but my wellbeing is more important.",8,20
Vyvanse,"My doctor switched me from Adderall IR 20mg twice a day to Vynase once a day. It takes a long time for the Vynase to kick in, but when it does it causes tremendous dry mouth like I've never experienced.  I would take it at 5am. At 10:30 I would feel dry mouth and anxiety for about an hour. On my ride home from work around 5:30pm, I got very drowsy. By 8:00pm  I was extremely drowsy and would fall asleep on the couch if I sat down to watch TV. This never happened with Adderall. My overall anxiety seems better while on the Vynase. My mood also stayed relatively constant throughout the day, versus the ups and downs I feel on IR Adderall. I found that my appetite actually increased on Vynase, and I gained 8 pounds in 1 month which is unacceptable to me. Nothing else changed in my life except the medication, and I attribute the weight gain to this. Also, constipation was worse. Overall, the drowsiness and weight gain outweighed the benefits I felt from Vynase.",4,9
Vyvanse,"I'm still early days (Less than 2 months in to my prescription ) and I must say it is promising. The focus this gives me is amazing, I've started on a 30MG a day prescription and since I have had so many less issues with my memory and recall as my brain feels like it is functioning at a normal rate. The side effects as it wears off are not great, as another user said, Tight jaw, tense jaw muscles (much like the drip / gurn on Coke XD ). Appetite is non existent but as long as I have my partner to remind me to eat it shouldn't be a problem. My main issue is my prescriber messed up and I went 10 days without it after finishing the first 28 day course and it mucked me up. Extreme tiredness and very irritable, spiralling mood swings. Will update after this next set with more thoughts on it. Overall an effective medication for me",9,20
Vyvanse,"I love this !! The ups and the downs. I will start with the downs - it is pricey for me. The ups - it is amazing I was getting C's and  D's took it about a week into it my mind focused I saw the world for the first time and I was able to grab my 9 thoughts at once and multitask and I started nailing my goals and started getting B's and A's in school then I was able to get promoted at work. I LOVE THIS I had to jump off it after 2 years because of the price but I gonna get back on it. It is too great to pass up. I had little side effects sex drive still high, mouth little dry and wasn't depressed so worth it!!! For those wondering 270$ for a 30 day supply... :(",10,17
Vyvanse,Worked fine but elevated my heart rate so I had to stop taking it.,7,9
Vyvanse,"This medication was ok for my 11 year old as far as appetite goes.. he did start eating better on this medication and it served its purpose during school hours, however.. at the end of the day, it was like a flood gate of energy was opened and he was bouncing off the walls.. currently looking for a replacement..",4,12
Vyvanse,"Began 20mg on Wed. 10/24 at 9 a.m. First day fine - didn't feel as anxious as have been on Ritalin 10mg 2x/day. My doctor said maybe would work because it's slow releasing compared to Ritalin's immed. release. Thurs. awoke w/ a headache. Took another 20mg Vyvanse at 9 a.m. Headache disappeared and focus was good through my 10 a.m. class but by 1 p.m. felt very anxious. Went home at 5 p.m. Felt so emotional, kept crying. Kept thinking about everything that has happened in my life. Trouble falling asleep. Took dose Fri, Sat., &amp; Sun. at 9 a.m. but by Sun. my emotions were so unbearable for went Vyvanse on Mon. 10/29. Had wheezing/breathing trouble &amp; brain zaps. Took Ritalin instead because of all these. Wish Vyvanse was miracle drug for me but it's not. Tried many different drugs I'm overwhelmed but went back to my doctor, prescribed Zoloft for the anxiety. Began 10 mg today. Doctor said to stick through the next 2 weeks and call him if I feel suicidal. Just sensitive to meds. Be very careful.",2,25
Vyvanse,"I am 20 years old. Dose 30 mg. Taking this medication for mood improvement (depression), and focus (ADD). Since starting: Much more organized thought process, improved ability to communicate with others socially and keep a conversation going. Have been told by others that they notice a significantly positive change in my ability in social settings and in my affect. Intense focus in any activity I take part in. Significant increase in productivity and a major reduction of my depression symptoms. I am happier and more confident. Not easily bored anymore. Motivation levels have increased greatly and I actually feel like doing my hobbies again (I had completely lost interest in them for a long time ) Very suppressed appetite. Can get so focused with an activity, I will forget to eat all day. Must force self to eat. Weight loss.  Teeth clenching. Tense jaw muscles. Thirst. Overall positive experience with this drug so far.",9,36
Vyvanse,"First day or so was great.  I was focused great had heaps of energy felt good.  Then came the next few days loss of appetite, pains in my body and chest, extreme anxiety and outrageous mood swings.  It was so bad dont think Ill take it any time soon.    Not a medication for me",2,17
Vyvanse,"I took adderall IR and adderall XR for several years.  I then switched to Vyvanse.  It made me feel as if I was a zombie.  I would be depressed and find myself staring into space.  I also feel I need to address a comment by Mimi that stated vyvanse and adderall are very similar.  As a pharmacologist I can tell you they are different, albeit similar, medications.  The chemical structure is different, the pharmacology is different and on and on.  So they are not bioequivalent.",5,17
Vyvanse,It worked the first day at 20 mg from then on it really did not have any effect. I went from 20mg to 30mg and then to 40mg and it still really had not effect. I took a short acting Ritalin at 10mg and it didnt  work. Are they different medications?,3,5
Vyvanse,Insane. I get so much done. My days used to be disorganized and unproductive. Now I literally run laps around everything. This is amazing.,9,35
Vyvanse,"I am 46 yrs old, and was officially diagnosed with ADD last year. My doctor put me on Adderal.  It worked wonders, as long as I remembered to take my second pill. Since my insurance did not cover the extended release, I was put on Vyvanse 54 mg I think. My focus is longer acting which increases my functionality at work, however the side effects have been unfavorable for me. I have headaches, diarrhea at least 2 times a day, nausea, extremely irritable, extreme dry mouth, gained 7 pounds this month, more depressed, and halfway through the day I get very tired and I feel like I am waiting for the second wave of medication to hit. My follow up with my doctor is tomorrow and I am going to request to go back to Adderal. I just think over all I was a more pleasant and functional person. I do not want to try yet another ADD med because I am scared of more side effects and I had minimal side effects on Adderal. I am glad that Vyvanse helps some people... but it doesnt work for everyone.",4,18
Vyvanse,I'm on 20mg Vyvanse XR 1 daily in the AM. Within the first few days it was life changing. But that only lasted about a week before it stopped. Upped to 40mg &amp; the process started over again. Now Im on 60mg and the same but better. My body has adjusted to the stimulant affects but concentration &amp; focus has improved but the issue is it works for a limited amount of time.  Vyvanse is a pro drug it takes anywhere from 1-2 hours to kick in. Once mine kicks in Im locked in for a solid 4 hours &amp; then it starts to evaporate quickly. Vyvanse is a great medicine &amp; it has helped me immensely but I dont think its powerful enough to mask the symptoms I deal with on a daily basis. I gave it a 9 because the potential it has is. The downside is youre not hungry at all. You have to force yourself to eat. Ive been on this medication for 3 months. When I started taking it I was 200lbs. Im currently 170lbs. I recommend to eat something in that 1-2 hour window you have before the meds kick in,9,15
Vyvanse,"I am a 30 year old female, 177lbs, that is prescribed vyvanse for Binge Eating Disorder and ADHD. It did not help ADHD, so Dr kept upping the dosage stating that was the reason it wasn't helping. It did help BED. I experienced these side effects from the beginning (20 mg) with each increase they became more overwhelming. As I hit 50mg, I became so severely depressed I could not socialize, experienced depersonalization, detachment from myself, my life, my friends. No pleasure in anything. No sex drive. Almost lost my job. I began having reoccurring thoughts that I just wanted to die. It dawned on me that all of these symptoms appeared &amp; worsened over the course of time I've been taking vyvanse. I stopped taking it 5 days ago and have been able to experience moments of joy, socialize and contribute to conversations without feeling as though I don't recognize myself. I've also been on antidepressants in the past and none of them worked either.",1,9
Vyvanse,"So I've only been diagnosed at the age of 33 with ADHD and suffered for so long and now taking this drug has completely changed everything. The positives I've found are focus, everything seems easier to handle and I now feel balanced.  The negatives I've found are I don't eat much now and have lost weight really quickly. Over all I'm really happy",8,18
Vyvanse,This medication is a life saver. Ive been on many other ADHD medicine and they never lasted through the day. Vyvanse wears off at the perfect time for bedtime and helps me accomplish many things during the day without getting distracted. Vyvanse turned my life around and helped me keep a job and get through school with all good grades.,10,21
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse has been a true answer to everything I have asked for !! I have been taking it for over 2 months at 60 mg. I can focus, finish projects and complete daily activities. I feel more comfortable in large crowds. I can't speak highly enough about this medication..",10,23
Vyvanse,"I was on Adderall for years until the highest dosage stopped working for me. When I switched to Vyvanse I wasn't sure what effects I should be looking for. Was it supposed to be like Adderall? No. Unlike Adderall, which gives you tunnel vision to complete one task at a time, Vyvanse allows you to focus on multiple tasks. You're not wired and cleaning out your closet 10 times a day, its more like you're normalized - the way that you should be. As far as appetite goes, it comes and it goes.",10,30
Vyvanse,The doctor had my son on Adderal and I did not like the fact that it was considered a class II narcotic. He had terrible side effects. So his doctor said they now have a new drug treatment such as Vyvanes. Noticed he was experiencing same side effects as when he was taking Aderral. This drug is the very similar to  Adderal. So has very similar properties and side effects,2,6
Vyvanse,"This works pretty well for me, definitely have to remember to eat/interact with others/ not fall down a rabbit hole of hyperfocus on something else.",8,12
Vyvanse,"I just increased to 20 mg daily, from 15 mg.  This drug helps me to concentrate, focus better, observe when I become distracted, and have more energy.  Some negatives Ive experienced recently are difficulty getting to sleep and possible diarrhea.  Overall, I think the efficacy of this drug is very good.",9,9
Vyvanse,"My son has ADD and we thought this would be the answer to his problems.  While it did help his concentration in school, he ended up with terrible depression and was Baker Acted  (involuntary institutionalization and examination) because of suicidal thoughts twice.  We figured out what it was and got him off of it.  He has been fine since.",0,10
Vyvanse,"Focus was good but felt like a zombie or spaced out. I started binge eating like crazy! Gained 12lbs in 2 weeks!! Severe anxiety and panic attacks. Horrible chest pain, wheezing, and coughing. Sweating, hot, skin felt like it was crawling, cold chills, and severe depression!",1,15
Vyvanse,I have been on several amphetamine stimulant medications before and overall Vyvanse if my favorite by far. I like the fact it lasts all day so I only have to pop one a day. It had worked wonders in my life and had turned it around for the better,9,11
Vyvanse,"FACTS ABOUT ME/ MY VYVANSE HISTORY: *22-years-old  *Female *ADD and Dyslexic  *Started on Vyvance in the 4th grade  LONG TERM EFFECTS: *Scalp Picking  (my head is covered with scabs, I pick them) *Severe Anxiety *No Self-Esteem (I hate myself) *I feel Angry and Aggressive most of the day *I'm always worried about something (never relaxed...ever) I SEEM FINE, but I'm dying on the inside: Graduating from State University with Degree in MATH Current GPA: 3.75 I have a job lined up after college in Risk Management  I WOULD GIVE UP EVERYTHING I HAVE NOW IF IT MEANT THAT I DID NOT EVER HAVE TO TAKE VYVANSE!",4,24
Vyvanse,Helped with my concentration issues at work. Helped me complete one project before diving into other projects. Overall very happy with medication.,6,10
Vyvanse,"After months of going back and forth between Adderall XR 30mg (x2/day) and Vyvanse 70mg (once daily). I realized that Vyvanse works the best for me. It keeps me at the perfect, consistent level all day. I'm focused, complete multiple tasks at a time, without my anxiety going through the roof.",10,18
Vyvanse,I started taking vyvanse around 4th grade and I noticed that it helped a lot but I couldn't eat and when I would come home I wouldn't have the energy to do anything but sleep.,8,9
Vyvanse,"Has kept me balanced, focused and energized with no noticeable decrease in efficacy at 40mg every day for over four years. I have skipped a day occasionally, and took a week off to test myself for lethargy or depressed feelings, and felt very little change in mood.",10,19
Vyvanse,"I've been on it for over 5 years now (started in high school, now in college). It was a little rough at first, but once my weight stabilized I noticed no issues. NEVER. EVER. TAKE ON AN EMPTY STOMACH! I learned the hard way early on.",9,18
Vyvanse,"I have taken Adderall since I was 12 and recently changed to vyvanse about 2 years ago  (I am 38years old).  It is a miracle!  I only take one 70mg capsule orally in the morning time.  My morning starts early with three children to daycare and bus then work.  And I work weekends as well.  Im able to  have my fog brain for ten - twenty mins and then I can step by step get each task thru the day complete and then I am home ready for bed.  I have clear thoughts and I dont stop in the middle of five chores or jobs and get all frustrated.  All positive, but I do not have insurance and my thirty qty of 70mg cost $223 with the vyvanse discount card that basically takes off $90.  It is $312ish without.  When I had insurance my script was was $60.  I also get a lot of headaches. Adderall was just not working anymore and that was even sticking concerta in for a couple months. Thank you Vyvanse and Shire manufacturer, generic, 2023.",9,18
Vyvanse,"Ive been taking Vyvanse for three years, and Im 18. The medication has been incredibly consistent for well over a year at 60 mg. Personally, it doesnt affect my creativity or mood, but it did during the first couple of months while taking it. However, I started a low dose of Zoloft, and that worked brilliantly alongside Vyvanse until I faltered off a while later, and I dont need it anymore. Ive adopted a much more organized and confident version of myself, thanks to the drug. I have no problems sleeping.",10,15
Vyvanse,"Ive been taking this med since it first came out. I believe it was 2008. But I was diagnosed when I was like 6. Nothing works, Adderall, ritalin, nothing. Either Im a waking zombie or wired off the walls. No happy medium. Then when I was in high school I tried again, this time with vyvanse. Started at 30s, then 50s, then 60s, and finally 80s.  30- worked well, soon to grow a tolerance and stopped working after a month.  50- same thing, lasted a little longer this time, dry mouth occasionally. About 3 months  60- awesome. My happy medium.  Dry mouth of course, drink a lot of water. Carry gum lol, I never lost sleep (results may vary) 80- I was a zombie. Depressed. Not depressed. I didnt know. Everything was a dream. No one needs this.",9,12
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse when I first started was great until the 4th week into taking the medication. I am in the marching band, and during one of the performances, I noticed that I started having trouble breathing. I had previous reactions similar to this when taking other medications such as adderal. After the performance I went to tell my coach that something was really wrong. I thought I was going crazy, turns out I had a bad reaction to the medication and It caused me to have a really bad anxiety attack to the point in which I was screaming, and accidentally punched my coach. This medication is not for everyone.",3,11
Vyvanse,"Just on my first full month of taking 30mg a day of Vyvanse.  I only got diagnosed  with ADHD at 50.  The difference this drug has made to my life is simply unbelievable.  My Doctor told me that if I did indeed have ADHD I would notice a difference on the first day of taking Vyvanse and boy he was not kidding!  I have a clarity of thought I have never known in my life, not just a focus but an ability to think things out logically and complete task.  I start one thing, finish it then turn my attention to the next task.  Just remember, work with this drug push yourself a little when needed.",10,25
Vyvanse,"I recently returned to ADD meds after many years off and was put on 20mg of Vyvanse.  It does help me focus very well and makes me kind of fearless professionally and socially.  Unfortunately, it really doesn't motivate me which stinks.  It also doesn't help much with my creativity - I wouldn't be able to solve a complex problem any easier on Vyvanse.  Does work for a LONG time - well over 14 hours - and seriously trashes my sleep quality.  I don't take Vyvanse on the weekends to reset my brain.  I can eat if I think about it, but I can also go much longer without eating.  Vyvanse is very smooth - no big highs or crashes.  Pretty decent ADD med.",8,19
Vyvanse,"My son who is 7 has been taking 20mg for over 1.5 yrs. At first it seemed to really help. School work was going great. His teacher could tell a huge difference. But the last 6 month it's going down hill... emotional, headaches, crying over anything even spilled milk literally. Can't sleep. He's totally a changed boy for the bad. And his doctor won't change. I'm thinking his body just got use to the medicine.",5,8
Vyvanse,"First off I have to just say that I was on ritalin before I started vyvanse. Ritalin was awesome for about 4 weeks and then did the complete opposite making me depressed, horrible comedowns and downright stopped working. I've started vyvanse 30 mg and this is the third day I have taken it. It has made me really depressed and I've been crying uncontrollably. I don't know if I should keep going and play with my dosage to see a change with dopamine or go on antidepressants.  Advice highly appreciated",3,6
Vyvanse,"I feel like Im being a little generous by giving Vyvanse a 3 because it does work to some degree, but I have very unpleasant side effects from it. My doctor finally switched me to generic Adderall IR-thank God-and its fantastic. I must be abnormal with how I digest Vyvanse or something because I find it far more potent, and not in a good way. It gives me serious dry mouth, diahrrea, anxiety, excessive sweating, and depression. The effect was different almost everyday: some days were okay, a lot were terrible, and a few were good. It muted most of my emotions except a general sense of discomfort. But I could focus when it didnt make me depressed. On the hand, Adderall IR is a cake walk and I feel great in general.",3,10
Vyvanse,"I was only recently diagnosed with ADHA, in Australia this product is listed at a reduced price (pbs) at $31.00 (aud) sadly if you have been diagnosed over the age of 18 the price of vyvanse sits at $113 being over the age of 18 I have to pay full price, financially un-viable I had to research other products to see which product(s) were under the Australian pbs, the only product that is listed under the pbs for people diagnosed over 18 is dexamphetamine which I am about to start, if the product was more affordable I would not be changing over",10,0
Vyvanse,"My experience with the drug is somewhat unclear to me. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 23, I'm 24 now. In that time I have trialled a series of drugs. Atomoxetine, Methylphenidate and now Vyvanse. Out of the lot, I would say this one has probably been the best. However, as time progressed I felt the effects of the medication deteriorate which is sad and frustrating. It almost feels like it only ups my mood (not tackle symptoms). However, the first time I took it was amazing. My ability to concentrate was unbelieveable! I felt a strong sense of motivation/confidence in what I had produced. Sadly this was limited and the positive effects began to deteriorate as time progressed. I will never forget the first period though, it was liberating",4,8
Vyvanse,"No problem, never really felt high or speedy. When I didn't take it I was very disorganized and couldn't focus. I find that when it is out of my system after 12 hours I am extremely tired. I take trazone 50 mg. for sleep also really hard to get going in the morning. After the vyvanse kicks in I'm ok at about 8 after taking it at 6am. I do take xanax 1 mg. with it.",9,6
Vyvanse,"I take vyvanse 30mg for binge eating and ADHD. I  started taking it because I noticed that my binge eating was worsening. I am a very active 55yr old woman who works out 4-5 days a week. Weight lifting etc, also my job is physically demanding. I starting taking 50mg 1st for about 6mo. I lost 20lbs I could barely eat. I started to notice I was getting cramps in my legs. All the time I have worked out I never had these issues. So I lowered to 30mg. I am not getting horrible cramps all the time in my joints and arthritis in my hands. I realize that age does play a factor but its my shoulders too, I just ache all over at nighttime. And my eating has cut down but I tend to now just want to eat sugary and high carb foods. Kind of like a druggie.",6,8
Vyvanse,"After taking Vyvanse 50mg for 4 months for adult ADHD, felt on top of the world but instead I became manic and had an episode that my wife is using to divorce me and keep me separated from my daughter. I've not taken it for 2 months now.",5,10
Vyvanse,baby4  do you think you maybe clenching your jaw throughout the day? I have trouble with that. My dentist recommended a certain type of mouthguard (not the kind used for sports) but I never tried it...,0,4
Vyvanse,"I have been taking Vyvanse for 4 years now and I have been on the same dose of 30mg for severe ADHD. A lot of people have trouble staying on the same dose and need to increase because they get used to the drug. Just a tip: take as needed and when you feel the effects wearing off? Drink a one-shot espresso drink NOT an energy drink. Overall, if you are looking for a good ADHD medication I would recommend either Focalin OR Vyvanse. Best of luck!",8,12
Vyvanse,"WARNING: Majority of the positive reviews for this drug are from people that are new to Vyvanse and problem is that this drug works wonders at start but benefits quickly starts to diminish and side effects start to get worse. I took vyvanse for two years and at first it worked great for ADD. However after taking it consistently for few months I started experiencing anxiety, depression, aggressiveness, anti social behavior, insomnia and isolation... things I never experienced before in my life. The drug is also very addictive because if you stop you feel 100x worse then before you started taking it but the longer you take it the higher dosage you need to get same effect. Eventually it stops working and you just need it to get out of bed.",1,60
Vyvanse,"My son is ten yrs old, has been taking Vyvanse for about one month. He has developed a dry constant cough.  It work great for his ADHD but this cough is annoying constant and can't seem to stop it .",0,4
Vyvanse,"A client who is a psychiatrist recommended that I go in for testing. After 3 days of tests &amp; my history the Dr. concluded I have suffered from ADHD most of my life &amp; I've developed coping mechanisms to get me through but the untreated issue was contributing to my depression &amp; social anxiety. Vyvanse is the most amazing thing to happen to my life, I feel normal for the first time ever! I'm productive, healthy, focused, active, and social. I had to stop taking it for a 1yr due to insurance issues &amp; during that time I gained an unhealthy amount of weight, was depressed, binge eating, and completely lost. Since back on it, I've realized that it's not something I should be removed from my lifestyle if I want to remain happy and healthy.",10,38
Vyvanse,"This medication definitely has its pros and cons. And being a prescribed patient to adderall/vyvance on and off for over 10 years, my strongest advice would be to take it AS NEEDED.  After about 6 months I noticed horrible effects from this medication. Insecurity, anti social, over analyzing EVERYTHING. I found that I was worse than I was on my own without the medication. I got weird and felt almost an out of body experience, but before the 6 month period I felt great.",5,20
Vyvanse,"I have been taking Vyvanse on and off for a little over 2 years. I am currently taking 70mg. It really helps me focus and multi-task at work. It also has helped with my anxiety and I am able to tackle things that normally I would try to stay away from doing because of my anxiety. I usually take it during the weekdays and not take it on the weekends because I can go 10 to 12 hours without eating and barely having anything to drink because my appetite is not there. I've lost 95 pounds since taking Vyvanse. It also has made my libido go through the roof. There's an upside and downside to the medication. Overall, it has helped more than it has hurt but there are negatives and positives.",8,43
Vyvanse,I developed severe shoulder pain in both shoulders after about 5 days. The doctor assured me it wasn't the Vyvanse. Well after 2 weeks of severe pain I thought I'd do my own google search and found plenty of people complaining about vyvanse causing joint pain. I stopped taking vyvanse as soon as I read these forums where people described their joint pain. After 3 days 80% of the pain was gone and it took about a month before 95% was gone. My left shoulder now 'clicks' and often I wake up and my left shoulder is in a position where it's very painful. I wish the doctor would go over all side effects when then prescribe medication so you know when something starts to happen that it is the medication.,1,19
Vyvanse,"I am practically out of all options for ADHD medications due to side effects. Vyvanse has proven to be really effective for helping my ADHD. The focus I have is great &amp; allows me to see what must be done instead and actually do it!  I also have Body Dysmorphia Disorder which has paralyzed me from being able to go out of the house. My providers have been trying to get me to get out of the house for years! Unexpectedly, Vyvanse has practically eliminated my BDD &amp; fear to be outdoors!  For example, in any given week I might go outside once, if that. I can barely stand 1 hour of being out. Now with Vyvanse, I have gotten my life back. I didn't try. One day I went outside &amp; just stayed! Now, I'm always outside doing lots of things for hours!",9,37
Vyvanse,"I started taking this drug 6-7 years ago for school and planned to quit when I graduated because it made me anti-social, increase tobacco usage, and want to play video games all night. It was really effecting my personal and social life, plus I hated all of the physical effects (heart rate, cold hands, sweat). However, I enjoyed the high it gives you, and continued taking it after graduating. It helps lock you down at the computer and make boring work less boring. Now, I cannot stop taking it. Every night I lay in bed saying Ok I have to stop this., then the next morning I wake up and can't resist taking it. I am going to tell my doctor to cancel my prescription because the cons HEAVILY outweigh the pros.",5,17
Vyvanse,"For every positive thing this medication claims to solve, it creates multiple negatives. I have been on Vyvanse for over 2yrs now and have just now realized what this med was actually doing to me. I almost lost my wife, and ruined my children. In addition I managed to isolate myself from 85% of my friends as I build up disillusions as to why I cannot trust them. I have added an increased amount of pressure on my spouse, making her feel that it is all on her to keep the house clean. Why does the house have to be clean you ask? Well, when you are taking a higher level of vyvanse and 1 thing, ONE thing is missing... Get ready for RAGE! What kind of Rage you ask? The, Ok, I want to divorce you now rage. God I'm lucky my wife stayed with me.",0,28
Vyvanse,"Take Elvanse (50mg- UK version) in morning for past 2 years. Meds are slow acting, and do not improve motivation or efficiency when working. There is no alternative in the UK- no adderall- so this is the only option.  this medication sucks because:  1.) It gives such a great high for the initial 15 minutes to 30 minutes, but it gives such a horrible crash that the negative feeling ruins your day It does not help motivation if anything it causes depression , possibly improves concentration marginally.  2.) I have faced serious and significant weight loss. Being skinny myself, this is of course not a good thing. Currently a 5'11 male, weighing 62kg or about 135 pounds. Am 24 years old.  3.) The medication is addictive.",2,12
Vyvanse,"I struggle, with depression, anxiety, ADHD and a lack of focusing. I had an extremely rough upbringing, (with my father dead at 10 then moving around until 13, and from 13 to 18 I lived with my mother who was on drugs and I found her dead. I drank a lot in high school smoked weed and around 19 had a perc addiction. I also dealt with being gay/ bi. I have always taken my medications for anxiety and as a teen I did not like adderal and did not take it. I started taking Vvyanse 3 months ago, I did not realize how good it was working until I realized how focused I was and at work felt fine. I am on 30mg it works great. I do wish sometimes when I am up at 6 it lasts until 2-3 but its not a bad feeling. I would try this medication if you have ADHD",0,35
Vyvanse,"I truly wanted to love Vyvanse. I have struggled with securing a stimulant prescription ever since I was diagnosed with inattentive type ADHD. I've read everything out there on Vyvanse and was so excited when my new doctor prescribed it for me. Also, I'm so used to waiting for drugs to start working (SSRIs mainly) that I kept waiting to write this review. What it's come down to is this: I really just don't know if Vyvanse works for me. I haven't noticed any significant changes at all. The things I have noticed are small and very possibly coincidental. I am currently taking 20mg, which I know is a relatively low dose, so I tried taking 40mg one day and felt like I wanted to die (nausea, anxiety, etc).",5,10
Vyvanse,"Adderall worked okay on me, but I wanted to try this to see if it worked better and without side effects. I'd heard good things, but for me it did not work out. My anxiety spiked. I noticed my heart rate felt too fast even though I was just sitting there and it was just a very uncomfortable anxious feeling. Even with the dosage high enough to give me this much anxiety, it didn't work very well! I would forget to do things all the time for example. And I see why they use this on binge eating disorder because it made me not want to eat even when I was hungry. At least it kept me awake and slightly more focused than I would be without the medication, but I'm going to explore other options.",4,10
Vyvanse,"Summary: effective treatment of ADHD, awful if you have anxiety or BED/anorexia This was the first drug I took for ADHD. It was extremely effective. I was able to get all my work done in my classes with time management I had never had before. However, the side effects can be extreme. It made me extremely self conscious. I would apologize after virtually every sentence in a conversation because I was so scared something I did/said would be perceived as rude. I became obsessed with my skin and weight, developed severe dermatillomania and I lost about 35 pounds Vyvanse crash is awful. In the middle of the day as it would wear off I would suddenly become extremely agitated, snapping at people over something as small as the sound of their voice",6,24
Vyvanse,Works like a charm!,0,3
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse 60mg pros: laser focused, VERY social, upbeat, very confident, if you have ADHD you know what I mean when I say 'the fear' disappears. The fear when you think about your to-do list and the task of organizing and prioritizing and asking yourself whether or not you can do something. The fear of anticipation of that goes away. It's euphoric.  cons: VERY dry mouth, I had to get biotene, I am going to scale back to 30mg because 60mg really made me lose some of my inhibitions. I couldn't control what I was saying. I said things to friends I've known for 10 years that I have NEVER said, good + bad. Start with a lower dose. Make sure you don't use this drug for weight loss. It's tempting but it's disturbingly unhealthy and often times fat",0,19
Vyvanse,"A lot of people seem to get on great. 3-4 hours of intended effects is all I get, during that time I feel more motivated, social and can process information better. After that time I am even worse than I was before starting the meds! Depressed, irritated, withdrawn, empty, angry, really bad. It's like the the 12 hours it's supposed it last, more than half of it is just a really long come down. I will be asking for instant release Dextroamphetamine next time, I assume and hope that they will be just like the initial period of this med which is perfect and helps with all my adhd symptoms.",3,17
Vyvanse,"My son has ADHD, he was on Concerta which started out working well, but started not working this year.  His Neurologist prescribed Vyvanse.  He was only one the drug for one month, it was the worse experience every.  Not only didn't he sleep, my son developed a Tic and depression.  I do not recommend this drug for ADHD, it worsened my sons.",1,16
Vyvanse,I have an appointment in a week to get ADHD and bipolar meds but I was given a sample of a 70mg vyvanse I had previously been trying to  do the dishes for about two hours (procrastination) I could feel it kick in after 2 hours and I ended up cleaning every inch of the kitchen. Cleaned the walls cabinets and all the appliances. I was actually interested in cleaning and was able to keep cleaning for 10 hours without getting off track. The effects only lasted about 10 hours and I could tell when it was ending because my cravings for cigarettes started again. I only smoked about 2 cigarettes in that period. I binge eat if I don't smoke regularly so its great for quitting smoking along with focus for ADHD. Will be asking about this one.,10,21
Vyvanse,"I've been on Vyvanse for a year. I take 50mg now and I wouldn't say it's a miracle drug, but over the past year I have attended more classes and gotten more consistent grades in university. I definitely have to put in the effort to experience the benefits; it's not motivation/focus-in-a-pill for me! The side effects I've experienced are increased anxiety, dry mouth, increased perfectionism, irritability, and some insomnia. Its impact on my mood varies. At first, my appetite decreased and I had terrible afternoon crashes, but they have levelled out over time. Overall, the pros outweigh the cons for me. I haven't tried anything except for Wellbutrin, which I still take. Not sure how they interact.",7,26
Vyvanse,"Just recently diagnosed with ADHD and specifically asked to start out on vyvance at 30mg/day. I'm 23 years old and had been struggling with severe ADHD my whole life, finally decided to go get it checked and vyvance being my first medication taken for it- it's completely calmed me down as a person. I feel like I have such clear thoughts which made me feel incredible, I finally felt normal. Helped with my hot temper and impatience as well. First week has been successful.",10,27
Vyvanse,"Caused my 10 yr old son to develop severe depression, and a facial motor tic which never went away. Now he takes medication for not only ADHD but also depression and tics. Worst drug experience ever!",1,16
Vyvanse,"First off, would like to say that I have and always have had severe ADHD and have been on Adderal XR 30mg since it first came out 15 yrs ago at 30mg.   Always had my psych trying to get me to try Vyvanse and turned it down until last week when I realized over the last 2 years my Adderall seemed not to be working and would wear off by 1pm every day and still scattered. Was highly apprehensive at first and started out at 60mg on Vyvanse to begin and likely will be at 70 next Dr visit. Vyvanse has been a true god send for my condition and a miracle drug 4 me.  Can think clearly for first time in years and accomplish goals at work and home and much longer lasting- I highly recommend - downside is it takes about 2 hours to fully start working.",10,24
Vyvanse,"My son was diagnosed with ADHD at age 7, we tried adderall for a while, the patch, but he didn't like them. Finally we found Vyvanse. He is 10 years old now prescribed two 10mg pills/day but he takes only takes one in the morning because he was having side effects (lip licking, finger playing). This pill has seriously changed our life's, if you are a parent wondering whether or not to use medication JUST TRY IT. We used to sit for hours after school trying to get home work done. His teacher would tell me he is not completing work and distracting other students. He was falling behind in school and now he is caught up and receiving awards.",10,35
Vyvanse,"I got diagnosed about a month ago with ADHD I also have GAD, depression and severe migraines. I was very disorganized, didn't finish tasks, depressed, super anxious, I would try to talk to someone and my mind was else where and had no idea what they were saying. I started vyvanse 30mg, it helped for about a week for all my symptoms even my migraines! I could sleep like a baby at night. After that it helped in the morning, in the  afternoon I would feel depressed like I could cry at anything, the anxiety was still gone, but everything else came back including the daily headaches. My Dr switched me to 60mg I hope it lasts longer then the 30mg, so far so good it's only been 2 days. I'd recommend it.",0,13
Vyvanse,"I've been on Vyvanse a few years and I remember the exact moment I realized it kicked in. Out of the blue I thought oh my goodness is this what normal feels like. My main reason for this post is in reading here I've noticed a couple of people have mentioned the expense. If you go to Vyvanse website you can get a savings card, the card brings the cost to $30:)",8,31
Vyvanse,"I have been taking ADHD medications for about 10 years and vyvanse is by far my favorite. I take 50mg of vyvanse as needed. I always feel very productive when taking it and It really helps me focus and get things done without the procrastination. Although, it does what it is supposed to do I do have a few side effects that prevent me from taking it everyday. I have a history with anxiety/depression and this medicine brings back some of those symptoms. Also, I tend to be a perfectionist when I take the medicine. I catch myself taking longer to take exams and redoing my makeup or hair or brushing my teeth more than once simply because I feel like it isn't just right. Also I am more isolated and less social when I take the pill.",6,24
Vyvanse,"Tolerance builds slower than Adderall and other instant release stimulants, but still builds fast.  Lasts a good 12-14 hours as well, just make sure you don't take more than you should because when your tolerance builds you're pretty much done with.",10,13
Vyvanse,"I've been on Vyvanse for 2 years. I started on 50mg. I was on that dose for about 6 months, tapered down to 30mg for a few months, and found a happy medium at 40mg. 50mg was too strong and 30mg was too weak. I have a pretty severe case of ADD. For an adult, I never thought ADD would be an issue. I finally saw my doctor who prescribed me Vyvanse. Vyvanse was the first pill I've ever taken for my ADD and it's seriously improved my life immensely. Biggest side effects for me are increased anxiety, OCD tendencies, insomnia, and frequent mood issues after taking it. The ultimate biggest con for me is price. My insurance pays very little. It's around $250 per month.",8,16
Vyvanse,"My son is 14 and has always been super sensitive to these meds- he was diagnosed at 6 ADHD. We started with concerta- he lost 11 lbs in 5 weeks. We switched to a slow release methylphenidate.  At Christmas, it was felt that maybe he needed something different- his last increase didn't seem to be helping. That's when we started vyvanse. I have seriously mixed feelings about this drug. There is some control of the hyperactivity component but he's grouchier, more argumentative and not really more productive. Is it age and adolescence?",3,16
Vyvanse,"First i want to say that everyone is different and not everyone reacts the same to medication.  I started with Concerta, it didn't work for me at all. I didn't feel like myself, it took over my personality and I started to have heavy anxiety, panic attacks, anti social and paranoia. Then I got Vyvance and its life changing, It doesn't feel like I'm on a prescription. It's more a tool that helps me get through everyday life. I'm much calmer, I can concentrate on one thing at the time. I get so much more done and I feel like I'm in peace with my mind. My patience has improved, I'm less impulsive and I can sit for a long time straight without feeling bubbly or restless. Side effect- Dry mouth, no appetite. But EAT and eat smart, it gets back.",9,43
Vyvanse,"I've been on vyvanse for about 2 days now and I can't believe the difference from the other two medications I've tried. (Adderall and Focalin) I was diagnosed about a year and a half ago, I was not diagnosed when I was younger, which would've have really explained a lot.  First I tried adderall, it didn't do much but make me a bit irritable, and still not focusing was on 50mg a day 30mg in the morning and a 20mg in the afternoon, and I didn't notice a thing. Next was the generic of Focalin, which dild absolutely NOTHING! With vyvanse I feel like I can concentrate on one thing at a time, and not have the urge to start 10 other things.  My doctor put me on 70 mg in the morning, it's a bit of a slow start, but once it doesn't its a very productive",9,17
Vyvanse,"This medicine may help but if I missed a day, or tried to get off it completely, worst experience ever. It's basically pharmaceutical meth, try older meds like dexatrin or Ritalin. Vyvanse withdrawals are awful so once you're on it it's hard to get off",2,19
Vyvanse,"Today was my first day on this medication (30mg). I am 27 year old female, diagnosed at 14 with ADHD. I was prescribes dexies when diagnosed and because of the strength of the narcotic, I wasn't able to continue them and chose to find alternative ways to deal with my ADHD. As a full time university student and a single mother, I find it difficult to stay focused and keep up with my daily routine. I felt completely overwhelmed recently to the point I would procrastinate and nothing would get done. That in itself caused me anxiety. It was triggered because of that fact I am dealing with a custody battle and that issue has consumed my attention, and felt because of that I was unable to do the things I needed to accomplish. So far so good.",7,11
Vyvanse,"First - diagnosis is mild ADHD. 11 years old. 50mg. Our experience with my son and vyvanse. He was on this medication for approximately 9 months. For the first few weeks, he was sort of hyperfocused and had difficulty with transitioning from a task if he was fixated on it. He transitioned well to middle school and achieved great grades. However, he lost a lot of weight. About 15lbs. He had horrible insomnia. He slowly became very emotional and depressed in the afternoons and evenings. We decided to stop the medication. Within weeks he was back to himself and his doctor advised him to stay off the medication.",7,4
Vyvanse,"My 8 year old was diagnosed with ADHD this year.  We tried a non-stimulant first (guanfacine) but it didn't work plus she was soo sleepy on this.  Switched to 30mg of Vyvanse and instantly her grades &amp; school performance increased.  She also plays sports and has improved due to better focus.  We constantly had to yell out into the softball field to be ready prior to the medication.  Now, she's always ready to go.  Side effects to begin were insomnia for about 3 days.  Dr. suggested 2mg of melatonin which worked fine.  We did melatonin for 2 days then she was back to falling asleep on her own.  Weight loss is also an issue.  She's down about 6 lbs but she's tall 4' 7 and weighed 94 lbs.  I don't give it to her on the weekend and she eats ok",8,15
Vyvanse,"I have been on Vyvanse for about 10 months.  It is an amazing drug to reduce distraction, calm the hyper/distractable me and just enjoy life a bit better. The only downside for me are two things:   firstly, the afternoon crash can suck.  I often am left feeling a little anxious or irritated. The other thing, and probably the more annoying side affect, is that is does impact my sleep.   To minimize these side affects, here are my tips that work for me: 1) stop drinking coffee or other stimulants. 1b) wait until you are properly awake before you take it...  2) don't drink on medication days. 3) schedule your diet and stick with it. 4) exercise in the morning (before taking it). 5) have your no medication / chill days.",8,31
Vyvanse,"I was on Vyvance for just under 1 year.  It worked really well.  However as the year went on my mouth got dryer and dryer, until I could only eat soft foods.  I talked to the Doctor and I went off them in the middle of January.   About 3 weeks ago I started a new med called AdderallXR and I can feel my mouth is starting to dry but not like the Vyvance.  While in the USA I found some mini brush on the go toothbrushes made by Colgate, called Wisp Max Fresh.  With dryness my teeth always feel like I have a film on them.  Today I used one of the brushes and and it really made my teeth and the dryness feel better.  No  need for water or rinsing.  Maybe I can cut down on the gum and candy. We'll see!",8,13
Vyvanse,"I've been on vyvanse for about a year maybe a year and a half but damn this medication is amazing when you take it normally, I say normally because I usually only take it when I know I gotta focus so like for school, work, a project, etc but when I'm just home I don't take it. Now vyvanse has helped me so so much its just the getting the medication on time is what I struggle with, because I've noticed now that when I'm off vyvanse my ADHD is way worse like the anger and getting distracted part. Yet I don't like taking pills in general I know they do damage inside but if it works it works you know I'd rather struggle with the medication than have to deal with ADHD alone.",8,20
Vyvanse,"My son is 6 they started him off on Concerta he seemed fine we had minimal complaint the only downside is everyday around 7 he would be in moods over silly things, but it would pass. Now the Vayvanse had him in HULK mode as he would describe it. He was very snappy and angry and became aggressive with the kids at school, (which was never an issue before). I hated that stuffed. I'm beginning to realize that finding the right meds is going to be a HUGE task.",1,16
Vyvanse,"After a few days on vyvance I started sleeping only 2-4 hours a night, then my doctor raised my dosage, now I was on 30 mg. And then a few weeks pass and I started to get really aggressive, yelling at people when I got just a little mad (like if someone accidentally bumped into me while walking down the hallway) And if that wasn't bad enough, I still couldn't focus in school. and the longer I took it the worse my sleep pattern got. I started staying up about 40 hours at a time and sleeping for about 8 hours, And then finally my parents decided to take action and take me off of it. it took me about 7 months to get back to sleeping on a regular schedule",1,10
Vyvanse,"When I was put on Lisdexamfetamine within a month of first taking it everything has improved. Things I would not normally do. I did my daily tasks, showing interest in things,  my impulsiveness movement has slowed down,  my thoughts slowed down and I can sit down and talk to people and hold a conversation with people.  A big thing that this medication has is the fat ingredient so I am now 11 stone as I was previously 9 stone so a big improvement. Within a month in everything as a person so this medication is a big thing in my life and feel the doctor has made the correct choice. I would recommend it to anyone who ADHD like me and if they are on it you will see improvement like i have big time!.",10,11
Vyvanse,"I had good grades. I could concentrate. But, I became very aggressive. I had to stop taking.",5,9
Vyvanse,My 9 yr old son started vyvanse two weeks ago (lowest dosage) and we saw positive results right away.  In addition to ADHD he has a writing disorder and will literally sit and stare at his paper for hours because he can't get his thoughts written out.  The first day he tried vyvanse he took it in the morning and then came home from school and without being asked he finished his book (25 pages) and then sat down and wrote a 2.5 page book report!  I have not noticed a change in his appetite and he has only experienced some minor sleep issues but it does not seem to really bother him.  Testing has shown my son to be highly intelligent but his grades do not reflect that - I finally have hope that he can reach his potential!,8,38
Vyvanse,"I have been taking Vyvanse 30mg for 2 weeks for adult ADHD. It has been very helpful for me to stay on task at work and get things done that normally I would have a hard time with. I used to get very overwhelmed with what needed to be done and completely shut down, not getting anything done at all! Then beating myself up for being a procrastinator etc. I have not had any issues with insomnia or any other side effects, besides the normal appetite suppression during the day, which as resulted in an 8lb weight loss in 2 weeks. No complaints here as I need to lose about 20. I recommend not drinking more than 1 or 2 cups of coffee while taking this. I did once and was jacked up. Not a good feeling. I highly recommend taking this if you are an attention deficit",10,53
Vyvanse,"My cousin's son takes this medicine and he almost 12, They recently increased the dosage to 40 mg.  I have doubts on whether he is a better student because he seems to struggle with school regardless of being on the medicine.  Apart from school, it seems to have scary side effects - major weight loss, no appetite whatsoever, anti-social behavior, argumentative attitude that noticeably goes away on the weekends when he is not on the medicine.  Is the dosage possibly too much?  I wonder if the drug has affected his mental health related to food as well, borderline anorexia?  He is less than 80 pounds now and I want to say something to intervene. Recently he broke out in sweats at dinner one Friday night with rapid breathing, really scared.",0,17
Vyvanse,"Things to be mindful of: Can cause extreme anorexia-be careful if you are struggling with anorexia or bulimia nervosa; Helps reduce binge eating greatly- good for binge eating disorder and bulimia when the person is trying to correct bingeing and not abusing the drug as a way of losing weight; Can cause depression, suicidal ideations, and tiredness- Usually is a result of taking a dose that is too high and the symptoms usually occur once the meds start to wear off; Can cause severe anxiety- taking Vyvanse at a dose that is too high can cause severe anxiety, this can usually be resolved by lowering the dose. Some of these things can be resolved by adjusting the dosage but sometimes a specific medication doesn't work well with your body.",8,20
Vyvanse,"I was diagnosed with ADD and my doctor recommended me to take vyvanse 40mg. The first day I took it around 6:00 am and it started to work about an hour in. I was able to focus very well and was a lot more sociable. However, the good effects of the medicine only lasted for 5 hours and then everything went downhill and I felt depressed. My heart was beating faster than usual, dry mouth, and had no desire for food. The next day thinking it would be better, it didn't kick in until around 2:00pm and only lasted for a few hours. Sometimes it would leave me feeling very antisocial and aggitated. Today is my last day taking it because it hasn't worked for me at all today. Wasn't hungry all day, felt very sweaty, nervous, aggitated, out of breathe.",4,20
Vyvanse,"I started this medication when I was 45 years old and started back to college.  I never excelled in college in my younger years and actually made the Deans list after taking Vyvanse.  I am now almost sixty.  I really don't need it other than helping my golf game once in a while.  I just wanted to say that it is a great medication for keeping ones focus, however I did experience quite a bit of hair loss.  I only take 20mg.  I do take breaks on this medication and have noticed that my hair grows much thicker when I am off of it.  Just an FYI.",9,45
Vyvanse,"My experience has been great and horrifying. Now, to explain myself I will list the effects I've had so far. I am on my fourth dose of my 40 mg vyvanse. I was put on 40 because my doctor said it would be okay. ADVERSE EFFECTS: *Severe* Just today on my fourth dose I had experienced something new my entire life..sitting on my chair I lifted my leg and was overcome with the feeling of it, falling asleep. It was overcome abruptly out of nowhere with the feeling of tiny bubbles in the numbers of thousands racing from my foot up to my thigh without any of these, in idea of description bubbles popping. Until it reached my thigh when it was immediately somewhat relieved...skip to later today and my leg was paralyzed almost",1,11
Vyvanse,"I just recently started on vyvanse, and it works very well! So I'm 21, and in the past I've been on adderall, Ritalin and strattera. But none work as good as vyvanse. Adderall worked but left me feeling jittery, and Ritalin when it wore off I became angry. And strattera that's a whole nother story! But the main thing I like about vyvanse is I still am me. I don't feel jittery or like a robot. I'm me just with everything at a more calm controlled manner. The only downfalls are that it takes 2 hours to start working and only last 6-7 hours when I was told it would be 14 hours. But other than that it gets 2 thumbs up and 5 gold stars!",9,25
Vyvanse,"I was first given this drug when I was only 6,  I started having horrible crashes When I was 7 I started getting hallucinations of my toys coming to life and beating me to death and I'd scream and kick when my parents came in to try to calm me down. I have 30min-4 hour anxiety attacks, I feel sad empty and useless, I felt like everyone was judging me and I almost committed suicide twice, once when I was only 9. I tried stopping the drug but found the nausea, pain, and anxiety only got worse without the medication so now I'm stuck,. These people saying the drug is great have not been on it for long, please if you are thinking of getting this drug, don't.",3,21
Vyvanse,My son was diagnosis with ADD two years ago. He was also struggling with Anxiety. Was seeing a therapist.  He is now 17  A year ago he was put on Vyvanse 30mg and 50mg of Zoloft.  My son did say that by the last couple of class it wears off.  3 months ago we down his Zoloft to 25mg.  His therapist discharged him saying he didn't need to come any more.  Now the 30mg  doesn't seem to be working.  We went back to his doctor who is new since his doctor left the firm. She is putting him on 40mg of Vyvanse. His other doctor didn't want to go up.  I wanted to up the Zoloft back to 50mg. Doctor says no take the higher dose of Vyvanse.  I have not started it yet. Have to wait because I just got the lower dose and the discount card won't pay twice.,6,9
Vyvanse,"I was kinda focused in school when I took this but that was only for the first period or 2, I ended up getting really tired and was getting a lot of anxiety and had like 3 panic attacks (this was my first time ever being on any kind of ADHD medication)",3,8
Vyvanse,"Started Vyvanse (30mg) about 3 years ago, and still on it to this day! I am extremely more concentrated, and have more motivation throughout the entire day. This medication saved my life, and I have not looked back every since! Plus you loose weight, so that's a plus (:",10,43
Vyvanse,"I have to give Vyvanse a solid 10. I asked my Dr to switch me from Adderall instant release 20mg 2x a day to Vyvanse and in my honest opinion this was the best decision I made. Vyvanse helps me focus, more motivation, feels more subtle which I absolutely love. Adderall for some reason made me feel like a different person, but with vyvanse I feel like myself still which is great. It is really long lasting, I don't know or understand how people say it only last for a few hours when in my experience it last a good 12-13 hrs. In fact I heard people say it loses potency after 4 hours or so but in my experience I think it actually increases. But this is just my experience, and maybe metabolism aswell but anyway I hope this is helpful for others.",10,43
Vyvanse,Ok so I'm 18 I'm have been taking these for a little under a year and it keeps you very attentive  specially because I have school and after school  activities along with homework.  It does help you focus although it suppresses my appetite a little too much I try to force myself to eat but it  seems like I can't. I have a loss about 25 pounds and went from a size 8 to a 4 in jeans because of this medication. I don't know if anyone else experienced this but it won't allow me to keep food or fluids in my system I continue to run to the bathroom all night and all day sometimes even at four in the morning. But for the most part it's a good product for what it's used for.,8,25
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse has been a fantastic medication. It is far better than other medications that I have tried. It last all day and when you take the right dose you don't notice it kicking in and you don't notice it when it wears out. I take it first thing in the morning at 5-6. I was taking 20 mg and that seemed to work well. I am currently on a two week trial with 30 mg to see if this works better. This is a medication where it works best when you find the sweet spot. Just because you don't notice an initial buzz does not mean it does not work. The other very important factor is caffeine . This should be keep to a minimum as the combination will light you up . If you feel anxiety, don't have any coffee, you will. See a real change. (:",10,25
Vyvanse,"Cons - suppresses appetite, and it sucks cause I'm already so thin! (Sz 4) Pros - increased attention, more social, and can think clearly, smoother movements.. thinking before speaking, calmer.  I don't take it on weekends (job is relatively easier on weekends) and off days.  ADHD (severe - combined type)  I think those of you who are experiencing suicidal urges &amp; depressive moods are more likely dealing with a much deeper issue.",9,20
Vyvanse,"I have been taking vyvanese for about 21 months. I have been taking 30 mg and will not up it. I am 63 and sought help after reading some blogs about older adults taking this to help focus and have more energy. I have never really taken any medication my whole life. I take it mainly on work days and if off or on vacation I generally don't take it. On this blog it sounds like a lot users have other issues. Anyways this medication has worked wonders for me, makes me more sociable, happy and able to continue concentrate. I work as an engineer. I follow my doctors recommendation in taking it first thing in the morning with food. It generally wears off about 4-5 pm, no sleep problem. I highly recommend for older adults but keep dose low.",10,38
Vyvanse,Felt more attentive and helped take away depression I had lived with for years.,8,26
Vyvanse,"Been using this medication for almost 2 years now, absolutely no side effects. Even noticed an improvement in general nervous system and HRV with the meds. Huge difference from the ritalin and concerta which gave me various allergic(increased body temps, skin issues) and intimate issues. No such issues with this medication. Using 60mg most of the year, but 30mg in summers, since I don't need that much when there is no requirements to what I need to get done. Lowering dose also helps with sociability for me, whereas higher doses gives me extreme focus and drive to stay on task.",8,29
Vyvanse,"Took for two months, 1 Capsule a day for my ADD. I have tried most ADHD medicines, stimulant and non- stimulant types. I was expecting a 'non event' transition, from adderall, to  Dexedrine predominant Vyvanse. I have used Dexedrine and found it helpful with focus and follow through issues, with minimal side effects. Vyvanse did not turn out to be what I'd hoped for. Minimal fuss, and a stable continuation of living and treating my ADD. Vyvanse Had no similarities to Dexedrine . Felt sad, bad, and disconnected from being in the moment. Side effects did not disappear during course of treatment. Somehow a perfectly acceptable  Drug ingredient, Dexedrine, became Lisdexamphetamine. The long acting formulation benefit is lost, to a imposter drug",2,11
Vyvanse,"When I first started on Vyvanse (30 mg) I thought it was a miracle.  I was social, energetic, and losing a lot weight.  After about 6 months on it (40 mg) things started to change, I began having horrible crashes where I would experience depression, OCD type behavior, and thoughts of suicide.  Trying to get off it it brought about terrible withdrawal symptoms; I gained a lot of weight, was lifeless, and extremely depressed.  I really wish I never started this drug. I noticed a lot of people loving this drug have only been on it for a short amount of time, so come back and update your review when you have taken it for 6 months to a year.  The rebound affect of stopping it has been awful.",2,45
Vyvanse,"I started with 20 mg and it was great but after 5h I felt that I lost effect of medicine. Doctor ordered 40 mg instead and I felt depressed. Instead i'm taking 20 mg elvanse   10/15 mg adderal. I have to say that this medicine is the best ever. Side effects are dry mouth and sleep problems and tired when medicine goes away from the body. If you don't eat and drink water you gonna feel bad, remember that. I recommend to take magnesium if you feel tension in your body  and vitamine c before you going to sleep ( it makes that medicine goes away faster from your body). This medicine makes me focused, i do things properly done, likes to talk with other people and I feel so.. quite in my head. Before  tried ritalin and concerta, worst meds.",10,22
Vyvanse,"I suffered from severe depression and anxiety in my early teens and was prescribed Lexapro. It had no effect whatsoever. At 17 I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Vyvanse. This drug single-handedly solved these problems the instant the first dose kicked in. Like other patients I experienced the need to increase dosage as the effects weakened. I got up to 75mg and eventually backed down to 50mg as it was interfering with my sleep. However, unlike others this dosage has been sufficient for 4 or 5 years. This has been a wonder drug for me, but after 6 years, I'm starting to question its role in other life issues I've been having. My social anxiety is now worse than ever, and I find it difficult to remember and perform various obligations.",9,33
Vyvanse,"I have not tried any medication beside this, and I could not feel anything from 30mg or 50mg, and I do not have any hope for 70mg either right now.",1,4
Vyvanse,"Be careful. I was prescribed this at 20mg for my depression and ADHD last February. For the first few months it was a miracle. It took care of all my symptoms, and even obliterated my social anxiety. As the drug became less and less effective over the months though, I became more and more depressed and that's when the miracle pill suddenly became a burden. Doctor prescribed me 30mg, worked for two days, then nothing. Not to mention at that dose the crash was awful, some days I would cry over everything and wish I was dead thinking there was no point to life. That's where abuse came along. Some days I was taking up to 60mg just to feel normal (without doc's approval). Overdosed on 400mg and almost died. Be careful please, always think twice.",4,46
Vyvanse,Worst drug to alter your mind and make you crazy. Severely depressed and suicidal,1,23
Vyvanse,"Worked great for a couple of months when I first started. I've had ADD my entire life and have never felt clear minded for focus. At first when I started vyvanse I had no side effects, after a couple months of being on it my grades were up in school but I started getting tons of side effects from it. The most notable was the social anxiety from it and having a hard time talking to people. When I first got put on this drug I was able to hold conversations with everyone but then it made me super shy and introverted... So fast forward another 3 years I was still taking this drug and actually addicted to it. Everyday no matter the circumstances I would take anywhere from 30-90mg per day. Stay away from this medication if you are easily addicted",3,20
Vyvanse,"Made me psychotic, Messed up my sleep (go to bed at 5 am and wake up at noon) And the worst part is, it didn't help. Later my doctor then prescribed me adderall, then ritalin, then a bunch of others, all did the same thing then i decided to go to a holistic doctor, now i'm on synaptol (a natural medicine) and i can now actually focus at works.",1,23
Vyvanse,"My experience was probably the worst I've had so far. I lost 20 lbs with 40mg of Vyvanse. I was a healthy 145 lbs, I am now 120lbs. I had horrible diarrhea, its was so bad. I was extremely faint and dizzy. I could go without sleeping and eating for almost days. I had terrible heart fluttering feelings. However it did work great for my ADHD and also for my depression and anxiety. But, of course, I struggled with malnutrition and have been struggling so much (still) with gaining the weight back. I then had taken 30mg, but then it was not enough. Finding the right medication is such a struggle..",1,15
Vyvanse,"Was recently diagnosed ADHD 32/F.  prior to this I was always told I was depressed and had gen anxiety disorder. Was put on numerous drugs (all failed) Zoloft being the latest for anxiety and it helped (150mg). Recently was put on 30mg of vyvanse (had to stop until I was pulled off Zoloft, they didn't mix well). Today's my first day on vyvanse (last night was my last dose of Zoloft) so I feel anxious and shaky. I know this will subside. For years I've always felt so exhausted because I wake up a lot at night. Today I cleaned my car, kitchen and showered all before 9am. I'm likening vyvanse so far lol. I will post at months end to give another review since I'm still in the grey from switching meds.",6,15
Vyvanse,"I've had Adderall, Dexedrine, and Concerta as well and this was by far the worst. I took it for nearly a year and had multiple panic attacks a day while on it and watched my personality turn from calm and timid to raging and confrontational. Switched to dexedrine and had much more success, but overall found counselling and CBT for ADHD to be infinitely better than any drug I've taken for it.",2,13
Vyvanse,"I started taking Vyvanse since I was 9 after I was hyper (not being quiet in class, swearing behavior, aggressive behavior, etc. ) So I got Vyvanse in november. It worked well until when I was 14, I ended uo getting stomach pains and diarrhea every month and overnight when I eat. I am still having that every month now. I now stopped taking Vyvanse. Not taking that again.",0,11
Vyvanse,"I had been taking vyvanse for a little of a month now for adhd and binge eating. it has worked well so far. I'm able to concentrate and have a little more energy. I felt no side effects at all,and I'm one who is scared to take a vitamin. I was on topamax for binge eating and it was the worse experience in the 37 years of my existence. I had already managed to loose a little weight on this so far.",10,12
Vyvanse,"Great at first, then you titrate up, and eventually you plateau and realize it's not working as well as it did and you're a junkie if you keep jacking up the dosage.  I gave it up and don't miss it.",6,14
Vyvanse,"Before taking Vyvanse, I was on Adderall, then Adderall XR for my ADD. Neither were near as helpful for energy or concentration. Vyvanse was able to give me energy and concentration that lasted all day without making me jittery (except the first few weeks I was getting used to it), or wearing off.   My doctor gave me an attention test to see if I needed Vyvanse. I scored in the lowest percentile. After being on it a couple months, finding my dosage, I took the test again and scored in the top percentile.  Since then, (seven years later) we've only had to up the dosage once, and that was because I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, which aggravated all my mental conditions.",9,37
Vyvanse,"I let my son try this today for the first time.  He complained of having a sore throat, didn't eat hardly any of his lunch and then threw up in the car on the way home from school.  This is a 6 year old who's only 46 lbs.  We also had 2 instances today where he swears he saw something that wasn't there.  It's 11:30 at night and he is still up on a school  night.  I put him to bed 2 and a half hours ago.   This is my first experience with a stimulant for his ADHD.  No he won't be taking this again tomorrow.  After reading all the possible side effects and how common they are I'd rather have a kid bouncing off the walls all day than one who can't go to bed at night and may loose weight when he's already underweight.  Never again.",4,16
Vyvanse,"My son has been on this since last year, from the start of school (2nd week of August) until the end of September he had 32 office referrals! I was at wits end and didn't know where to turn and as a Psychology major didn't want to use meds, but needed something. We talked to his doctor and she prescribed this and at first it was rough the first week his attitude became worse and my wife wanted to try something new but I stuck with it and from the time he went on the meds to the end of the school year he only had 1 office referral and that was because we forgot his meds. Now the he does play sports and has a great personality but the only problem I have is his weight. Since he has been in it now for 1 year he has lost 3-5 lbs.",9,21
Vyvanse,"Addressing the misinformed subscriber who proclaimed,  Vyvanse is SPEED! , and that it's use led to his rapid addiction to speed. This is clinically not possible. Though there is an underlying component of amphetamine to this med, it is moreover a CNS (  Central Nervous System Stimulant ), as is stratera ( which contains a large percentage of norepinephrine in it and may help those battling depression as well as ADD) .  Guess what else is classified as a CNS. - your morning coffee.  We all recognize Folgers and Nescaffe as unregulated gateway drugs, so shouldn't we get excited about them as some of these '  users and their abuses of caffeine ' aside the evils of Vyvanse? Personal responsibility and accountability are key.",10,62
Vyvanse,"This medication was possibly the worst experience of my life. In the matter of a week, i managed to have my boss lose all hope in me, i ruined my 3 year relationship and for the first time in my life, i was so depressed i had thoughts of death ( not to mention I was kind of moody all day). Not to mention it actually made my memory and focus worse! Thank God i had a couple adderall left to make it until my next (emergency) appointment! Thanks Vyvanse! You really changed my life! I have a psyc appointment tomorrow morning, i am going back to adderall! Vyvanse didnt last a full week for me, maybe it's different for other people.",1,13
Vyvanse,"I was diagnosed in 2nd grade with ADHD I was held back in 1st grade and was not improving so they tested my IQ to their surprise I tested gifted and scored extremely high on my standerise test. My doctor put me on 40 mlg of vyvance my grades went to straight A's than stayed that way. It was great for my attention disorder, unfortunatey I felt all the side effects. I lost 20 pounds because I wouldn't eat, I became very anti social, and irritable, and some times I felt depressed. As a young kid this bothered me because school was socially hard. I would not take my medicine and kids would love me I was hyper funny and happy. These days my class work would be poar. I'm now 18 and I still take it I still have the side effects but I do good In school",0,18
Vyvanse,"I am smack in the middle of the effects of this drug. NOT on the effects it has on ADHD but the effects it has on the rest of my mental health... I first started Vyvanse 4 years ago, with no other underlying mental health issues other than ADHD. When I first started taking the Vyvanse, it completely saved my life. I was confident, energetic, motivated, and happy. Only about a month later, stopped working SIGNIFICANTLY and I felt like my life was over, that was because in only a short month, I became addicted to SPEED, which is what this is, by the way. It will help you INCREDIBLY, but only for the amount of hours it works before it wears off, and then you will feel worse than you have ever felt in your life, and end up getting addicted.",5,19
Vyvanse,"I was diagnosed with ADD in forth grade, however my doctor decided to just have the school put me on a learning program, (504 Plan). Throughout the years, I started to develop depression, agitation, severe anxiety and OCD. I had tried EVERY anti-depressant, and they had all failed. My PCP started me on benzos, which helped a little. I decided it was time to go see a mental health physician assistant. She went over all my symptoms and she immediately realized that I had been mis-diagnosed and the PCP had me on about 5-6 medications. She started me on Vyvance 40 MG and my life has forever changed. I am generally very happy, and able to function, went from severe anxiety to mild, which is helped with Valium. I recommend Vyvance!",10,13
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse is a highly effective stimulant class medication for ADHD and ADD. I have ADD, diagnosed at 18 and have since been on Dexamphetamine 20mg per day. Recently I was interested in trialing extended release medication and Vyvanse was the answer to my call! Initially, Vyvanse was a little bumpy; some side effects like anxiety persisted for the first few days on the medication. It was complex to find the right dosage so my psychiatrist and I settled on 70mg per day.  Vyvanse is an amazing and considerably more effective medication than regular Dexamphetamine; the pharmacological properties of Vyvanse are AMAZING.  Vyvanse is the future of treatment for ADHD and ADD.",10,21
Vyvanse,"I fell like kill myself after a week of taking this drug, very depressed, can't do anything. Stopped yesterday. Wast of money!",1,9
Vyvanse,"I have ADHD plus anxiety. I was diagnosed 20 years ago. I've always had difficulties in school, work and life because of this. I've been on Ritalin, adderall, strattera (awful med) plus 30 or more anti-deppressants, anxiety meds, seems anything from A-Z.  I started 20m vyvanse month ago. 1st 6 days okay...had headaches. Then came irritability, paranoia, crying, scared, ALL negative. Concentrated to hard, more mistakes at work. I purposely dumped it in the sink. Only positive: 1-3 hours of energy. Doc switched me to Metadate CD. After 3 days, the fog began to lift and no side effects. I'm sorry I wasted $50. But that's life and today I'm good.",2,6
Vyvanse,"Overall, in my experiences I have learned that in terms of extremes... the  Methylphenidates will turn you into an emotionless robot, hollow inside, socially avoidant person unable to experience life's pleasures. Nothing makes you happy, but at the same time,  nothing can make you sad.    Whereas with the Amphetamines (like Adderall and lesser extent Vyvanse) you become an extremely emotional, almost volatile, person who can experience pleasures in an extreme way. You get so overjoyed by the little things but the smallest of pet peeves can really set you off.  Vyvanse has been the best one for me. Just be aware of how you are treating those you love especially several months after starting. You may need a secondary med to balance mood.",10,33
Vyvanse,I started on the medication and it worked fine. A month later if i didn't take it i would get huge mood swings and usually start crying about everything. in those mood swings i usually felt like i was worthless and couldn't do any thing right.,4,11
Vyvanse,"I was on Vyvanse for ADD. I started off at 30mg and enjoyed the ability to better focus my attention on tasks and it worked as an appetite suppressant. I increased it to 50mg and that is when my eyes started to become blurry. I decreased it back down to 30mg and I still had blurry eyes at times so I discontinued using the medicine. While using the medicine, I took my Vyvanse in the morning early and then 50mg of Zoloft in the early afternoon. If I took both pills at the same time in the morning I become agitated and felt like EVERYTHING was important and found it hard to concentrate. It was a really weird rush of emotions. If it doesnt make your eyes blurry or make you agitated this is an awesome drug. It started working within a week.",6,10
Vyvanse,"I feel that I have had ADHD all my life, but I was only officially diagnosed when I was 17. I have been on Vyvanse for close to 6 years now and I can say that in the beginning it worked just how I hoped it would. It gave me energy and the ability to focus and get things done that I needed to. I started off on one 30 mg pill a day but I feel that I quickly built up a tolerance to it. I am now on two 50 mg pills (100mg) a day and it still doesn't have the effect that it used to on me. That is just one of a few things that I don't like about it. I feel like it worked for a short amount of time, but now it's just a pill that I can't get out of bed in the morning without taking. My depression has also worsened because of it I feel.",5,18
Vyvanse,"I am a 22 year old male - diagnosed with inattentive ADD about 2 months ago. I was prescribed 30mg Vyvanse right after my diagnosis, and have moved up to 50mg (been 3 wks). My problems with ADD started in elementary school, and continued all the way up until a month after I graduated from university (but got worse). Deciding to get tested for ADD was the best decision I ever made! Vyvanse has been a blessing to me, and the benefits FAR outweigh the consequences. I can focus longer, stay on tasks until they are completed, pay attention to detail much easier, articulate my thoughts/words better, and motivate myself to get work and other activities done. It's not a miracle drug, but HELPS (key word) you manage your symptoms and function easier",9,33
Vyvanse,"I started taking 30mg Vyvanse about 2 months ago. Prior to this, I've been unmedicated for ADHD for about 20 years. For this time I have been coping with inattentiveness and failing school grades.  When I first took Vyvanse I noticed the effects after about 30 minutes. My head felt very focused and conversations with people became very clear. For the first time in a long time I could listen to someone for longer than 1 minute without my mind trailing off to another thought.  I try to take Vyvanse as earlier as possible. Usually I take it around 8:00am with 9:00am being the latest. Taking Vyvanse after this time tends to keep me up past midnight. Vyvanse lasts about 12-15 hours for me.",9,40
Vyvanse,I was on this med for a little over a week. Right off it made me feel great everything was good. And I really liked it and I was happy I found something that worked. But after a week it started to make me really really  hungry I could not get rid of the hunger. So I had to stop taking it. I have a hard time to find a med. that works. I had the genetic tests done and there is a lot of meds I can't take. So it is hard to find one that works. I have ADHD and there is not much meds I can take. Vyvanse was a  question but it worked well just made me hungry. I wished it did not make me hungry. Now I hope my Doctor puts me on another ADHD med.,6,5
Vyvanse,I'm an adult with ADD. Vyvanse changed my life. I'm on 70mg. My only problem is that I wish it would last about 3-4 hours longer.,9,17
Vyvanse,I am an adult with ADD it has been a struggle my entire life. I am successful but as I moved up the ranks I have much more paper work and schedules to keep which is very hard for me. I have been on lots of different meds which all did not work or had bad side effects. I now take 50mg Vyanse every morning and it is great no side effects after the first 3 days I took it and it helps me stay on task with no evening crash.,9,34
Vyvanse,"It has been 4 months and I have to say it has made a hug difference for me!! I am focusing more, doing better at my current job.  I also feel a certain confidence in my interactions and with interviewing. The thought/words come to me quicker.",10,33
Vyvanse,"I have always had a problem with focus and attention and recently was told I have ADHD, I am currently on Vyvanse and when I started it, I found the first few days to be great. I almost felt superhuman with myself because I was able to start and finish things in one go and felt more active. I have had to have my dosage increased and I feel that as I take this medication, the effectiveness of it is dissipating and being replaced with a feeling of being Frantic and sightly anxious as well as it is affecting my mood and causing me to feel adgitated. I will be asking my doctor about trying something else as I feel that just increasing the dosage again would cause the feelings I am getting to becoming worse",5,24
Vyvanse,"I started off on 20mg and it did not work very well. I was very angry and still very distracted. Although i felt like that was the first time I've ever been actually able to focus on daily activities. Things peaked my interest more resulting in more productive energy. Due to my short temper when I started, my doctor prescribed me to Ritalin and that was THEE WORST experience of my life. After that, we tried Strattera which was even worse. I'd get sick to my stomach and just feel so drugged up. After a few different dosages she prescribed 30mg of vyvanse. I've never felt so productive and aware. I havent ever realized before this, how many impulsive decisions I make without thinking about the effects. Vyvanse has made me more self aware.",8,35
Vyvanse,"After being on adderall 40mg a day, doc switched me to vyvanse 50mg and although adderall worked great I found it only working 4-5 hours for the IR and I was feeling nothing from taking the XR. I take vyvanse for adhd, depression, and chronic fatigue from RA and EBV, vyvanse is amazing, no crash, no high and low just an even fluctuation through an entire 12-14 hour day! I feel motivated enough to concur my day but I'm not crawling out of my skin ! Love it !",10,42

Vyvanse,"It's definitely been a hell of a journey for me a whole year of school without good ADHD medication... But I have finally procured Vyvanse, I currently am taking a solid 20 mg, but so far for me personally it has been WAY more relaxing and effective than it's popularized counterpart Adderall. I actually take my Vyvanse with Adrafinil  in the morning with water sometimes with or without a breakfast meal, honestly i have the same effectiveness regardless of what i eat but that's just me. I have noticed the same effects from different psychoactive stimulants like Adderall XR, Wellbutrin, Coffee, and Imipramine HCL. But so far Vyvanse has been more effective and honestly has a better duration than all of the stimulants I've ever taken...",9,25
Vyvanse,"I was always smart, but my career has accelerated rapidly thanks to this drug.  I have the stamina and focus that I just would not have otherwise.  I had trouble  with concentration in college and it wasn't until I started taking vyvanse that I finally was able to complete tasks in a reasonable amount of time.   My GPA went from a 3.3 to a 4.0.   All the positives aside,  I missed the pill today and basically ate the entire house.  Withdrawal effects are Brutal.",8,37

Vyvanse,It worked wonderfully in my case! I've had learning difficulties and anorexia since the second grade. Forty or so years the disorder has been binge/purging with laxatives. Cutting myself when my weight ballooned. In January 2016 my primary care giver placed me on Vyvance. It was wonderful. I would wake up and food was not the first thing on my mind! I was able to focus on meal planning and my life felt like it had order! I could finish a task and not skip around. Unfortunately my doctor was more concerned about my weight than my being able to focus so she took me off the medicine that has help me more than anything I've ever taken!,10,33
Vyvanse,"I'm diagnosed bipolar, depression and adhd. Vyvanse 20mg - Started: started three days ago - Purpose: to aid in energy and focus to help me breakthrough crippling apathy - Impact: So far Vyvanse has been very effective at helping me to return to more normal functioning. Its impact on my mood has been mixed, although I can now do things which is nice, underneath there is still a layer of boredom. - Side Effects: Mild and fleeting anxiety about three hours after taking and again as it wears off in the evening - Future: Very effective, I hope to increase my dose to 30mg and stay there. I think that would be the ideal dose for aiding me in breaking through my boredom.",9,26
Vyvanse,"Diagnosed in late 80's as having Attention Disorder - however my grades were always pretty good that my mother and doctor did not put me on medication. As I began my career years ago, I noticed I had trouble staying on tasks and my impulsiveness at work was causing me problems. Worked with Behavior Therapist and that helped for many years. However, I still struggled to stay on deadline at work and that stress led to issues in my personal life.  Started taking Vyvanse 30mgs 3 mos ago at the age of 36. For the first time in my adult-life I feel that I have my act together. Still follow what I learned in therapy over the years - which I hope will help me stay at a lower dose. I pay $250 a month before my deductible is reached then 80% after.",8,29
Vyvanse,"Parents putting there kids on this stuff, yikes, man I just feel bad for your poor child. You realize you're giving them pure amphetamine right? I would avoid taking amphetamines until your brain has finished developing. Age 21-25. It's just absurd that something like Vyanse is prescribed to children. That said, for adults, this stuff is wondrous. Has changed my life. I've been taking 60mg Vyvanse for 3yrs straight with zero issues. Zero break.  Zero tolerance. I'm 32. Male. I've literally tried it all (Dex, Desoxyn, Addie, Provigil) &amp; nothing comes close Vyvanse! If you truly have ADHD as an adult, this drug will alter your life in such a positive way! Adults only though!!! Common parents, you're totally screwing your kids over.",10,57
Vyvanse,"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and I was first prescribed Concerta. Since Concerta is part instant release and part extended release it starts working extremely quick, within 15-30 minutes, which was nice because there was no need to time things out when taking the medication. Unfortunately, Concerta starts working immediately and also stops working immediately which for me led a horrific crash. I was irritable and angry after the medication wore off. Due to this my doctor switched me to Vyvanse. Vyvanse is a prodrug which means the actual drug inside the capsule is not therapeutically helpful until it gets broken down in the body. This allows for a nice steady come up and no crash when the medication is eventually excreted.",9,30
Vyvanse,"My 13 yr old son was put on Vyvanse for his ADHD and started at 20mg, 30mg and for the last two weeks has been on 40mg.  He's had the usual not much of an appetite, and of sleeping patterns.  However I've noticed in the last two weeks a drastic behaviour change in him where he is extremely emotional, very anxious, feeling like everyone hates him, depressed and wanting to hurt himself.  His pediatrician advised me to stop this medication .",2,37
Vyvanse,"I have been taking vyvanse for at least three to four years now pretty consistently. I have never wrote a review before on this medication because I was always at limbo about how I felt on it. I will say that vyvanse gets the job done as far as helping focus and pay attention to tasks. I am a full time student and this medication has helped me jump from a 2.5 GPA to a 3.5 GPA. I have taken up to 60 mg but I went through time periods where I would withdrawal myself from it and start back up again at 30 mg. The 30mg is way more manageable than any other dose I think. Although this medication has positively changed my life, it has also created issues for me. I am very tired when I do not take my medicine. Even if I miss a day..",7,33
Vyvanse,"I have a love/hate relationship with this medication. I was diagnosed with ADD in my late thirties.  Vyvanse helps me a lot...when I can feel its effects. I take 50 mg a day. For three hours, I feel wonderful and very productive. The drug make feel very calm, hence very focused. I feel at peace and I stop questioning every single thing I do. It's like my usually racing thoughts (cognitive hyperactivity) stop for a moment and let me focus on the task at hand.  BUT, when the drug wears off, after only three or four hours, I feel HORRIBLE! My throat gets tight, a disabling anxiety kicks in, I feel depressed, my thoughts start racing again and honestly, I feel like I could kill myself. So I go from feeling wonderful to being suicidal...",4,44
Vyvanse,"My 10 yr old daughter was put on low dose (20mg) of Vyvanse for ADHD.  Her ADHD was severely affecting her school work.  Positive:  immediately teachers and I noticed she could focus, sit more still, and initiate her own homework, etc...  But it's the NEGATIVE side affects that seriously concerned me.  She went from a cheerful, joyous girl, to a melancholy zombie.  Even worse, she became more and more depressed &amp; irritable at night.  She said she felt like she lost all personality and had a sadness that she didn't understand why.  I can not emphasize enough how scary it was to see her whole personality change, and that was not worth any benefits.she got out of Vyvanse. Other side effects:  loss of appetite, joint/muscle pain, mouth twitch.",4,30
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse is not like any other ADHD med out there. It is better! a lot better! I does not matter how much Vyvanse you take, your body will not let the amphetamine level go any higher than it can process it. This gives you control. Vyvanse is a spark, it lets you chose what to focus on, rather than make you hyper and euphoric like other ADHD meds do. Why it does not work for some people? Because most people fail to use ADHD meds accordingly! No med is a magic bullet. For those of us who actually have ADHD and have tried absolutely everything (healthy diet, good night sleep, exercise, multivitamins etc.), Vyvanse is the missing piece to the puzzle!",10,56
Vyvanse,I was told by psychologist I scored highest she has ever seen for adhd and doctor put me on 30mg and it does nothing.  I don't want an increased dose of this med i want something else.  Waste of my time.,1,10
Vyvanse,I can finally focus,10,24
Vyvanse,"My Daughter has been taking Vyvanse for about 4 years now she is 14 and taking the 50 mg, She usually takes it on school days, So last summer she wasn't taking it and she started her period but as soon as September came she went back on the 50mg her period never came back. Has anyone experienced this? the doctor said it had nothing to do with the medication but I have a feeling it does.",8,17
Vyvanse,"this drug not only gave me a low key eating disorder but it made me have terrible, TERRIBLE mood swings all the time. it would make me cry and be irrationally angry at everyone at the same time. on top of that I would bearly be able to eat because the pill is also used as a way to treat binge eating. it also made me feel like I was having a heart attack at times and my heart would feel like it was going to stop beating. the only positive is that yes it did improve my focus and motivation immensly.",3,22
Vyvanse,"If you have a pacemaker , DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.  I asked my psychiatrist if it would be ok to take this drug with a pacemaker,  he was wrong ! It put my pacemaker into rev me up mode. My cardiologist was not happy.",7,18
Vyvanse,I have used many ADHD medicines in the past and I never knew what attention I was lacking without vyvanse. The first week of taking 30mg is very different from the following weeks. In the first week I felt very conscious of the effects and it felt great but the following weeks felt like I was lacking. I am 18 years old so I had an upcoming SAT so I took 2 of my 30mg pills. I am 150lbs and In retrospect it was a bad idea. The whole day of the SAT I felt explosive energy and extremely motivated to work on questions. I am now on the first day of prescribed 60mg and I have a much greater work motive and I am constantly fueled with new productive ideas for tasks to complete. If you feel like you are lacking in motivation for work I recommend it,9,33
Vyvanse,"I have taking 20 mg and must say that it's the best medicine for me. I can concentrate, feeling peace in my mind. I'm also bipolar and before elvanse I tried medicine concerta and ritalin which made me more depressed and when they was going away from body I felt like awful. Elvanse is just a miracle medicine, I don't feel when it goes away. The only side effect of medicine is : dry mouth, not feeling hungry. Don't forget to eat and drink water because if you don't do it your bloodsugar will go down and you gonna feel ill,bad,headache !! I recomend this medicine !",10,22
Vyvanse,"My 14 year old daughter had been taking Vyvanse since 2010 - her current dosage is 50mg.  In the first couple years I believe this medication was a good fit for my daughter; however, It is my opinion she needs a change.  Also thanks to Obmacare effective 1/1/16 we are paying a copayment of $197 (from $40). Unbelievable for Vyvanse to NOT RELEASE A GENERIC until 2023!",2,12
Vyvanse,This is a miracle pill. It has helped with everything And I don't have am appetite hardly at all now. But after 3 weeks of being on 50 mg it stopped working until around 3 in the afternoon and I feel very tired. Doctor is supposed to hopefully up my dosage. But it really is the best and gives me a happy good energetic mood. Better then Adderall.,8,25
Vyvanse,"After years of trying both stimulants &amp; non-stimulants for my ADHD, Vyvanse has been a game changer. Its helped me to actually start LIVING life! Previously, I had the best results while on Adderrall, however the mid-afternoon crash left me irritable, moody, &amp; feeling like my ADHD was, in a sense, magnified.Thank goodness Shire (developers of Adderrall) sat out to fix the negative side effects (or at least attempt to), but keep the positives.  For me, the dry mouth is way more intense than with other stimulants. I have also noticed a drastic decline in sex drive. I would not be able to afford Vyvanse (I don't have insurance) if it were not for the Shire Cares patient assist program.",10,43
Vyvanse,"I have been taking Vyvanse for a couple of months now for my ADHD and BED, 40 mg seems to work fine with minimal side effects. My doctor recommended that I only take it on work days and give my system a break on weekends. However, I noticed that my binge eating has gotten way out of control on days that I don't take it, to make up for the loss of appetite during the week I guess. I mean, I eat constantly!  Is anyone else having this problem?",9,34
Vyvanse,"I have been on Vyvanse 30 mg for a year now and have had success taking it. I can work full time, have time management, take great care of my kids and keep my house clean. I sleep just fine at night. I do get irritable throughout the day if I don't eat. I feel nauseous and sick if I don't snack and stay hydrated. Hate to say it but it also worsens my anxiety slightly in the morning. Pros have outweighed the cons. As for weight loss I lost 7 pounds when I started taking it but have stayed at 130 pounds same weight for a year I am 5'5 and 28 years old. I feel healthy.",7,28
Vyvanse,Vyvanse is a wonderfully great med. For about the first month you take it. I'm on 70 mg and have been for a little over a year. It worked just as I wanted it to but the started to wear off and now I only feel the affect for about 3 hours then I get angry really fast. Also if I forget to take my morning doseage I just feel like I'm dying all day so I rate it 7/10,7,14
Vyvanse,"I have only been on this medicine for about two weeks at 20mg but it has completely changed me! It's awesome! I suffer from Depression, Anxiety, and ADD and was prescribed Lexapro to help with me depression and anxiety, it bumped up my mood a little but I still had depression and anxiety symptoms. The first day I took Vyvanse it kicked in after an hour and automatically I was more awake, happy, confident, talkative, and focused! It helped me so much with college when before I was failing almost all my classes I am in such a better mood now LIFE IS GREAT! The only down side so far is it makes me really hungry at times and I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep through out the night but it's worth it!!",9,19
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse has changed my life. I went from being a failing student to having grades above 90% in only a few weeks. These past 3 1/2 weeks have been the most productive weeks of my life. However, this med does come with a down side. Some side effects I experienced have been loss of appetite, dry mouth, trouble staying asleep, as well as some minor OCD. The OCD is really the only side effect that has been bothering me, when I have paper in front of me and I'm writing, I will constantly keep erasing what I wrote and writing it back down until it looks perfect which I've never done before in my life. As for social anxiety, I actually feel more confident going outside, my brain feels slowed down when working, and I don't zone out any more. 9.5/10",9,47
Vyvanse,"This medication saved my life! Better than any anti-depressant I've ever tried (and I've tried A LOT). Currently on it to help with my ADHD and Manic Depression (Bipolar 2) Side effects are small and definitely worth it (to me, at least). Dry mouth and decrease in appetite. I've also lost 40 pounds since I've been on it (Went from 182 pounds to *currently* 142 pounds)",10,45
Vyvanse,"Wonderful drug. I have been on it for over six months and it has remained consistent. I used to be on Concerta, which was ok, but I felt as if it lost its potency. Vyvanse allows me to focus and maintain concentration. It also gives me a boost of energy. At times when I have missed a dose and left the house for the day I have felt tired and disinterested in the activities I was involved in. I have no side effects from it but I rarely have side effects to any drug. I have read that you are not supposed to have vitamin C while on it because it can interfere with the drug's ability to metabolize in one's system. I avoid vitamin C during the day and take some at night. Take it around 8 or 9 so you can sleep at night.",9,37
Vyvanse,It's been good so far. Doctor put me from 30 to 40 mg. we will see how I feel in about two weeks when I see him again .,8,14
Vyvanse,"Completely stopped all panic and anxiety that antidepressants never helped nor any kind of benzo. After two months I was able to wean off of my antidepressants and happily zero anxiety or panic. I started in July after a bad try for a month of Concerta. Been on it since now month 7. Tried a few dosages but 80 is what works best for me. Since stopping the antidepressant end of August, I have lost 25 pounds!!! It helps control binge eating that I did out of frustration of my disorder.... I now make clearer healthier food choices and drink a ton of water. You must be careful with the caffeine intake and may possibly need something to help you settle in to sleep at night. I should but choose to only take one med currently.",10,40
Vyvanse,"Today was my first day on Vyvanse 20mg and it was incredible how much it helped my ADD symptoms! I felt motivated, confident, energetic, and very focused. I was able to complete a ton of school work in such a small amount of time. It feels like I get zoned in when I work on things, even if they're things I don't enjoy. My vision had major changes which was weird because it was like my eyes were finally opened?? My vision was so bright and colors were EXTREMELY vivid, it was like the whole world around me was alive. Effects of the medication started after just 10 minutes of taking it and it really kicked in about 1 hour after that. Would definitely reccomend.",9,46
Vyvanse,Having tried so many other drugs for this has been extremely difficult and disheartening.  Vyvanse is a GAME CHANGER!!,10,29
Vyvanse,"This drug is awesome. It is only my first day on it but I have to make a review. If you suffer from both Adhd and major depression, you need to try vyvanase. I've been on Dexedrine, adderall xr, and adderall ir. All of them made me tired. So tired I couldn't function. On vyvanase, I don't get tired. Is this what life is supposed to feel like? Life is good.",10,44
Vyvanse,"First, THANKS ALL OF YOU folks sharing. This is very informative. We are all trying to find something that works. My son, age 10, 5th grade, has been ADHD and negative overall for yrs.  Finally tried Vivance 20mg. Big help month 1. More talkative, able to focus, get things done.  Said it wore off or he got used to it by month 2 so uppedd dose to 30mg. Same thing, except after school a lot more sensitive emotionally.  He said he didn't see much difference after a few weeks so we upped dose to 40mg on month 4.   Still sensitive after school, no appetite, complained that he was grinding his teeth all day , thirsty all the time and dry skin then one day suddenly his wrists and web between thumb and finger broke into red purple DEEP DRY RASH. Stopped it",5,24
Vyvanse,This pill is very effective and has its ups and downs. I took this med in back in 2014 for my ADHD and stopped completely in 2015 due to the side affects. I am currently taking it again and it has changed me completely.  PROS:  *You can concentrate incredibly  *You get work done fast  * It makes you think twice * loose weight (if your interested in that) Cons: *You get paranoid *You feel nauseated the whole time *You become very antisocial *You get aggravated very quickly  *People always think your sad or something's wrong *APPETITE IS GONE  *You get sad fairly quick *Everything bothers you *Its very hard to get or stay happy *It gets hard to fall asleep  This is my 2nd month back on it and there has been a substantial change in me already,3,27
Vyvanse,"I've been on Vyvanse at varying dosages (30-40 mg) for about 2 years. I've never been on anything else really, so I can't speak to other drugs, but I feel like I got my life back. I did notice it would wear off for me around 3 in the afternoon though, and the doctor put me on a low dose of Dextroamphetamine at 2:30 to supplement the rest of the day. So far, so good. I don't want to take higher and higher doses, so I try to stay where I'm at and make that work. Most days it does. Great drug for me.",9,25
Vyvanse,I am 18 but I have been taking vyvanse since I was 16 years old at 70mg and still taking the same dose. It is 100% better than concerta XL it has changed my life  The appetite is not the worst thing I just get really dehydrated and not notice it I can eat after taking it ( 4h after taking it)  Keep in mind I have been on stimulant like meds for years now I have grown to fight the appetite effects,9,15
Vyvanse,I've been taking this medication for many months now. I take it on work days mostly &amp; days when I need to get up and go. I still have depression and sometimes it's hard to sleep but not always. It helps if you love food because I don't over eat but if I forget to bring a snack to work I get a little nauseous or I just feel super hungry by the end of my shift because I forget about food for like 7-9 hours. I try to eat food before I take it. Girls at work ask me what helps me be confident and sell stuff and I tell them vyvanse. I have depression and anxiety but this helps so much. I do feel really tired and like I don't want to do stuff on days I don't take it and after it wears off. So my doctors trying me on brintellex or something too.,9,11
Vyvanse,At first I felt like it was a miracle pill THE PROS I could finally focus I got things done  My grades improved extremely Id feel so happy I wanted to talk to everyone about everyrhing THE CONS(These are the side effects that came after taking it for a year or so) Im not the same person anymore I only care about what Im focused on doing I'm not fun and happy anymore I dont like to joke around Im constantly anxious  It makes me obsess over everything Terrible headaches  Beyond exhausted and light headed for the first few hours  No appetite  Cant sleep without medicine  In the middle of doing things its like my brain just freezes for a minute Worst of all I feel addicted to it &amp; I don't enjoy time with my children and loved ones like i use to,0,37
Vyvanse,"I am 20 yrs old and I have been taking Vyvanse for about 2 years now ...I take 60mg about the same time each morning and it really does wonders in helpig me concentrate and getting everything done both at home and school. I've noticed a BIG difference in myself on the days I do take it and on the days I don't. Only side effects are the loss of appetite, headaches from not eating (from the loss of appetite), dry mouth, irritability and now I have depression.. Don't know if I should lower my dosage now or maybe it's from another cause.",9,8
Vyvanse,"I am 21 years old  5'7 and 115 lbs. and I am currently taking 20mg in the morning. I've only been taking the medicine for about two weeks but I've noticed a lot of changes.  Positives: I'm getting my work done, staying motivated, I'm focused on the road when I'm driving now and I don't forget little details like I was before. Negatives: zero appetite- I have to force myself to eat, minor nausea, easily aggravated. It also altered my menstrual cycle. I am still yet to start my period but I've never been irregular- starting on the exact same days of each month since always. My mood has COMPLETELY changed in the 2 weeks. I'm severely depressed now and mildly suicidal. Can't tell if these side effects are worth it",6,26
Vyvanse,"My 7 year old son has ADHD. After years of struggling with ADHD as a parent I decided to finally try medication for my son he was prescribed Vyvanse. During the first month is was great he was finally able to focus in school and follow directions, I received  so much positive  feedback. Starting on the second month I noticed he was sad all the time at first I dismissed it as maybe he was having a rough day, than it became two weeks and it really effected his mood. My son starting to not care in school, he would cry for any minor thing, he lost a lot of weight and overall I thought he was depressed. I brought it up to his therapists who recommended we immediately remove him off of it.",1,27
Vyvanse,"I was previously on Adderall XR before going on Vyvanse. My reason for switching was because I suffer from BED as well, which this drug is basically a miracle drug for. As far as how this drug functions as an ADHD med, I do not think it is as effective as Adderall but it does last for a really long time, which has its pro's and con's. If you take it too late, you will have a hard time sleeping and if you want to go to happy hour or grab a drink that day, because this drug takes anywhere from 9-11 hours to leave your system, you won't be able to feel the effects of alcohol or the effects of the alcohol will all kick in at once Vyvanse leaves your system (be warned). But if you want to get a lot done during the day, its good.",7,25
Vyvanse,Just started vyvanse and am hopeful after reading a lot of the details provided by patients. I wasn't diagnosed until I was almost fifty years old. I always knew there was something wrong but I suspected that I was depressed. After seeing a therapist for about a year without much help from anti-depressants she asked me if I have ever been tested for ADD which I had not. Over two days of testing I was diagnosed with severe adult ADD. She started me on Ritalin which turned on a light for the first time in forty years. It was like I was seeing my wife for the first time even though we have been together for thirty years. Very emotional. Side effects from Ritalin and adderal which worked great have me on vyvanse now. Don't give up. I'm not.,0,22
Vyvanse,"I found this medication very effective, I am able to stay on task without changing my mood, speak clearer without getting tongue tied and I do eat smaller portion than I usually do. I've only lost 5lbs the max within two year and the only side affect I have is occasional dry mouth. It's best to stay hydrated and eat a snack in between meals while on this medication to reduce the dry mouth it works for me.",10,24
Vyvanse,"Ok I've been on V for 3 years now cuz I've tried all the other amphetamine based Adderall, AdderallXR,etc. Vyvanse seemed to address my ADHD issues but its almost a year since I've lost my appetite and most days I'll have a KIND bar in the morning but I take my V. It can be 8am or 11am and still haven't been able to eat. It feels like u have the flu and nothing seems appetizing, I take a multivitamin, B12 complex, as well as Iron. I have lost weight but after a year with not eating consistently but I am tired all day, crabby, my teeth hurt too",8,13
Vyvanse,Can not believe how much this med has helped me. So much more focused and I'm able to tackle larger projects with out feel so overwhelmed. I'm in my 50s and did not even think I had ADHD. My Dr picked up on that. Life is so much better now. I have been de cluttering and organizing my home and life like I have always wanted to do. Very happy with this med,9,40
Vyvanse,I have been taking Vyvanse now off and on for about a year.  I absolutely notice the difference when I am not taking it.  My doctor started me off with 50 mg but now I am on 70 mg.  I was afraid of how I would feel especially with the increase in the dosage.  Actually I refused to get the increase of dosage filled at the pharmacy but things began to get out of control when I stopped taking them and so I decided to start back taking the meds.  The 70 mg dosage was even better than the 50mg dosage.  It has helped me focus more and I have more energy than I have had in quite some time.  It controls my temper and though I didn't have a huge eating problem I am overweight and noticed that it curb my appetite.  I do love this medication.,0,31
Vyvanse,"Do not prescribe this to anyone !! This drug should not be legal. After 2 weeks it made me feel suicidal, which I've never been in my entire 33 yrs of being alive. It swung me into a severe depression and accumulated a huge amount of anxiety. This is the most unhealthy experience I have ever had. It ruined my relationship and my personality when I was taking it. I started a college class and the doctor prescribed this to me for concentration. It made me feel like I was on speed. When I stopped taking it about 6 days later I was a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT person, I was finally back to normal. Please watch your children or anyone you know who may be taking this.",1,32
Vyvanse,"Just upped the dose to 50mg, this medicine works good as far as getting things done and having energy, the first time I took it I was really concerned about my school work and helps me stay on task. The only bad thing about it, for a few minutes at different times of the day this medicine makes me feel like it's wearing off and I feel down or kind of worried then it goes away. So my happy felling goes up and down throughout the day.",7,27
Vyvanse,It works wonders,8,11
Vyvanse,"This medication ruined me. When I was in my freshman year of high school I could see no point in living. I started taking this in the second grade and now it has literally no effect. I was failing all of my classes and I gave up on trying to go to college, this drug makes you think their are two yous, the medicine normal or the non medicated annoying. The only reason doctors give this to people is to get money, scheduling appointments every 3 months.",1,28
Vyvanse,Did absolutely nothing for me. Even on the highest dose 70 mg. now taking Adderall 30 mg 2xday. Works only minimally. Now what.,1,6
Vyvanse,"This medication has changed my life. I didn't start taking it until I was 24 years old. I honestly thought it was hopeless trying to figure out my life. I kept failing college courses, struggled with my job, struggled with relationships. I genuinely thought I was stupid. Sounds dramatic, but that's honestly I how I felt. I just couldn't think or concentrate. Then I tried Vyvanse. I was really against stimulants or any type of drug that could be addictive. But, I'm SO grateful I tried it. I wouldn't be where I am today without it. I'm a nursing student with a 4.0. I have an amazing relationship and I enjoy my job. It's not a miracle drug, but it really helps me focus and do the things I know I can do. Definitely recommend it.",10,71
Vyvanse,"I was officially diagnosed with ADHD around age 28 but it wasn't until 30 that I decided to try medication. I started with Vyvanse. Holy crap! It was amazing. I hadn't realized how much noise went on in my head until it was quiet. Then I could have linear thought patterns. For the first time ever my life started to come together. I could see tasks in processes, I could think clearly, I could manage my emotions. It was amazing. Then the side effects kicked in. My dr and I went through every other adhd medication there was and nothing helped. I did more research and found that my problem was that all of the medications use dyes which gave me flu like symptoms. Vyvanse uses the most dyes so made me the sickest. I now take it out of capsule.",9,53
Vyvanse,"I have suffered from ADD/ADHD for all my life. I am currently 23 years old. I was on vyvanse (40 mgs, I am extremely sensitive to pills). I have tried about 5 different stimulant type medicines. Vyvanse really changed my life. I was able to transition from the food service industry to a Real Estate career. I got Mono, and had to stop the medicine while my body recovered. I really liked the way i felt off it. But i now feel as though my life is unmanageable. I don't like the feeling of being medicated so young with out any proof of long term effects, but i feel like i am drowning. I feel alone in my ADHD because its not something that people feel sympathetic toward. Vyvanse really changed that feeling.",9,36
Vyvanse,"I started taking this about 7 months ago. I have never taken any prescibed medicine prior to this. I am 62. Was having problems focusing at work. Taking 30 mgs and don't want to increase. Sometimes will take a break on weekends like this weekend. Really helps with focus, memory and energy level. I don't notice any side effects. Hasn't effected sleep. I take at about 6:30 AM and it wears off by afternoon. It is pretty expensive because insurance doesn't cover and have to visit Dr. every month. If you are older and in good health and have ADD symptoms I suggest you look into this. Your body adjusts to it over the first couple months. The first time you take it you feel euphoric but that is not what you want. Keep taking small dose.",10,37
Vyvanse,"I had taken Adderal for years.  90mg daily. It was suggested by my psychiatrist to start taking the Vyvanse.  I have really noticed a decrease in my energy level, and sometimes I struggle with motivation issues.  I take 70mg daily. I sometimes have to check to make sure that I did remember to take it that day.",3,12
Vyvanse,"There are many positives such as motivation, and a brief period of content, but there are also many negatives.. rapid heartbeat/chest pains, weight loss, dizziness, dry mouth. When the medicine kicks in, i feel this amazing sense of being content.., no matter what I'm doing at the time i just feel happy, but soon feel an extreme sadness and despair when it wears off, because i wonder why i can't be happy anymore. I also become extremely irritable, anxious, and restless. I continue to take this medication ,because it helps me get things done and focus, but the negative impact is extremely hard on me, and effects my mental and physical health greatly. Most common side effects for me are chest pains, sadness, rapid mood change, headache, and loss",4,34
Vyvanse,"Good. Concentration, happy, easy to talk to Bad: ECG showed it was bad for my heart, had to stop. Anxiety, afraid and didn't know why. Although it made me happy it felt fake and like I was a prisoner in my mind just  pleasing others. I won't take it to please others.  Meds basically free in my country after reaching over $300 cause third highest tax paying country in the world.",5,10
Vyvanse,My experience on this drug started well but has dropped off and I'm looking for an alternative.  The first couple of months I went from 20 mg in morning and another 20 in afternoon. I'm now at 70 and 40.  My therapist rx'd Kapvay with it to help with irritability and quick reactions to situations. While it helped the combo was making my teeth feel like razor blades and I was getting abrasions on my tongue. I dropped the Kapvay and it has helped with the teeth but I'm now dealing with several cavities to get filled.  Also having trouble issues with insomnia as I always feel like I need to be getting something done. Over the past couple of months I've probably had 5 instances in which I've gone close to 44 hours without sleep.,7,15
Vyvanse,"Started on by vyvanse after I was diagnosed with ADD at an age of 19. I had been on Strattera to previously which worked well, but I was still a bit lathargic. The first few months were great, but as the doses started increasing I became delusional &amp; physcotic. It go so bad at 40mg that I thought the mafia was coming to get me, but in reality it was just a car driving in front of my house. This drug ended up with me being sedated by the cops, and being placed in the psychiatric ward for a month. The withdrawals I got from this drug were horrible, I imagine it's what it's like to quit a harder recreational drug. I know this drug works great for some people, but not for everyone. I'd be vary cautious of vyvansae if you value your sanity.",1,35
Vyvanse,Been taking the drug for 2 weeks. The dosage is 70.  I have adult ADHD. The side effects I am experiencing are a slight head ache during sleep and I am experiencing insomnia.  Probably need to check my blood pressure more often.  I am not all that happy with current results.,4,14
Vyvanse,"I'm 47 years old never did good in school but managed. My wife has been saying I am ADD and spoke to my doctor about it so after a few months of office visits, I go monthly he said he's been watching my responses and wrote me Vyvanse 30mgs. All I can say is WOW finally everything makes sense I get things done no late afternoon crash its fantastic !! I have social anxiety very bad and this miracle drug took it all away !! I'm on my second month and higher dose just to 40mgs and its perfect !! I actually hugged my doctor on the following visit and thanked him for finally turning my light switch on ! I can't say enough about this miracle drug Vyvanse !! Now I can look forward to a new day instead of dreading having to get out of bed !",9,73
Vyvanse,Horrible effects on teeth. My teeth are literally falling out and disentergrating!  I am scheduled to have full mouth implants.,6,22
Vyvanse,"While Vyvanse worked relatively well for my ADHD symptoms, it did not last nearly as long as advertised. It only lasted about seven hours at best.",3,25
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse is hands down, in my opinion, the best ADHD medication out there. I was on Concerta from the ages of 7-13, then again from 20-21. I received genetic testing and it came back that my body doesn't metabolize Concerta very well. So the doctor gave me Adderall, which was too harsh with the come up and come down. Then made the switch to Vyvanse. Best decision.  #1. You don't crash when you are on it. It has the smoothest come up and come down compared to Adderall and Concerta.  #2. Vyvanse lasts a good 10-14 hours in the body  #3. It has the longest duration of action #4. It has low addiction potential  #5. It also is the only one that helps manage my binge eating disorder",10,60
Vyvanse,"I was on Ritalin XR, but it felt like rat poisen too me. I was only remembering the ups and downs, and the short goodtime was not worth it. Yesterday I took my first Vyvanse (Elvanse (EU)) and I was in heaven for the first time in my life. Everything that has been my problems seemed to vanish to some extent, and it lasted the all day! I'm so happy right know. I'm sitting writing this 2 hours into my second dose (day), and the most fantastic feeling has already kicked in. I'm so amazed that I can't get it out loud enough. :) I have been late diagnosed ADHD at age 48. I have struggled all my life with lot of failing, and had to work twice as much as others too achieve my goals. I'm so thrilled now for what the future will bring for me!",8,65
Vyvanse,Honestly it worked really well for me and even helped take away some of my anxiety (stopped racing thoughts) but I started off at a way too high dose and had trouble with insomnia and some dry mouth but I felt the effects after about an hour and it really does last all day.,9,30
Vyvanse,"My son was diagnosed with ADHD in 4th grade.  Teachers described him as having significant gaps during the day.  He'd zone out and get tapped on the shoulder to return to earth.  We tried meds but he's thin and lost too much weight.  Also, he developed nervous twitching. He tried various meds but all had side effects. By 7th grade, he refused to take meds.  We moved him to a Charter School for kids with different learning styles. It was a good school but he was furious over being placed there and refused to go.  He struggled all through high school getting mostly C's and D's even with accommodations.  He's now starting freshman year at a junior college and has ASKED FOR MEDS! He will start taking 50mgs of Vyvanse.  Fingers crossed!",0,26
Vyvanse,"I have been slowly taking increasing doses of Vyvanse for recently diagnosed ADD.  I've been on this particular stimulant for probably 6 months.  I was increased from 50 to 60mg a week ago and am havging trouble w/ Insomnia, but will wait and see if it goes away.  This is life changing for me as for the first time I was actually fired from a job I had for 9 years right after finding out my work issues were largely do to ADD, even though I advised them of my condition and that I would be improving.  I am in a new job with an employer who is much more caring and I'm doing better now that I have found a medication to help me.  By far positives of this medication outweight the negatives.",8,43
Vyvanse,"I have taken Adderall XR and Vyvanse. They both have a similar but not completely similar feeling when it comes to getting work done. But mainly my experience with Vyvance is quite good but not great. I take whenever I get up to go to school (6-6:30), and it takes an hour to kick in. I have been taking Vyvance for the last 4 years. It helps you focus a lot more than usual and it gives you the motivation to get work done. But the downside about it is that you feel depressed for a minute or anxiety, but after a couple of minutes you feel back motivated and happy. Also, I love that it gives you the mind clarity that I personally think everyone needs. Overall, my experience with Vyvance Is awesome. Btw I'm 15",9,65
Vyvanse,I've been on this medication twice in the past two years. First I was on focalin then vyvanse for about five months till I found out I was pregnant. It helps me a lot. I can focus a lot better but sometimes its hard to tell what I'll be focusing on. Sometimes its cleaning or sometimes its researching a very unimportant subject online.,8,25
Vyvanse,"I have suffered with BED and bulimia for over 5 years and after feeling like I tried everything to control my eating, including spending hundreds of dollars on therapy, I discovered Vyvanse. I was very reluctant to try it as I did not want to become dependant on any type of medication, but I was at my wits end with my eating disorder. My Dr started me off with the smallest dose(30mg) and after taking the pill each morning I did not feel much different at all. But I gradually worked my way up to the highest dose(70mg) and I could not be happier with the impact it is making on my life. Food is something I no longer 'love' and then 'hate'. I now have a healthy relationship with food and it no longer controls my life. Sure I still over eat and crave junky food sometimes, but there's nothing wrong with that... I am human. The only downfalls for me is that if I don't take it early enough in the day it keeps me awake at night(effects last approx. 13hrs) and I can no longer smoke weed or drink coffee as Vyvanse gives me a touch of anxiety. I realize that Vyvanse could possibly only be a temporary fix for me, but now that my mind is not ALWAYS on food I have been able to focus on controlling my emotions that trigger my eating disorder. I am not giving it a 10 only because it does give me anxiety and is extremely expensive! Thanks for reading.",0,43
Vyvanse,"After two hours of taking  this at 60 mg, I feel NOTHING! I have never been on any other ADHD meds except  this one. I've only been prescribed this medication two months ago and doc told me to take it once a day, everyday. I never abused it and never will. I am an avid runner and I run 3 to 5 miles everyday ever since I was 16, now I am 30 years old. I am also a serious health  conscious person. I know that this drug is to be metabolized in your liver before becoming active but I feel like this medication  goes through me too fast, like drinking water! I get more benefits  for my cognition problems with Brintellix!  This might be one of those cases where I might be  better on Adderral. I never experienced a crash on this drug.",5,11
Vyvanse,"5th month on Vyvanse 30 mg which is on the lower dose end. This med has an awful crash. I exercise 4-6x a week. I eat very healthy. I stay busy. I read so many reviews about the same issue. I did reading about the minimal crash felt on this med and it is so scary how pharmaceutical companies try to set the med apart.  For me it lasts 6 hrs and irritability increases. I think it's in-part tolerance. Mid afternoon, I get severely irritable, anxious, moody, sleepy, and agitated. It is so uncomfortable, I'm supposed to up my dose now...to see it last longer and my crash will start later?",1,25
Vyvanse,"I have been talking Vyvanse for just a week. 40mg. The first 3 days I couldn't sit down. I cleaned my house and my parents. Not just cleaned but extra clean, like walls and moving furniture and everything. But now it has faded a little. I noticed right away that when I am doing stuff, its like I really concentrate and try perfection for everything. My appetite has been curved, but I still eat. But no where like I did before. So far I lost 4pds. It's been almost a week. I don't get any feeling of jitters, or that I'm taking speed. I feel normal, I just want to do stuff. I'm more social. I always stayed in my home, but now I just want to go out. It's very nice feeling. I have no problems sleeping either, but I also take it as soon as I wake up",10,59
Vyvanse,"I am a student who has used Vyvanse for the last few years. I am currently taking 40mg-50mg. When I first tried it, a couple side effects were annoying but it didnt last that long. When I was in High School, most of the day I felt like doing my work and getting stuff done, and it made me see the positive in things. And  in college when I take it, especially on my days off, I get a lot of work done. I am not a very talkative person, but it made me feel like having nice conversations with people. In mid day, I am in a great mood, but sometimes it goes away every now and then. I dont feel like eating almost all day, but Its smart to eat breakfast before hand, and then dinner. I do have a small crash at the end of the day but it's worth it.",8,35
Vyvanse,I have been taking this medicine since i was in the 6th grade! I am now 22 years old. This medicine made me feel like i could actually sit in class with out falling asleep or not being able to concentrate. It's a great feeling to actually get everything done. Yes it does cause dry mouth and you may not eat like you used to. However you have to make yourself eat something other wise you can cause your blood sugar to drop witch would cause headach and nausea. With time you do get used to the medicine and you will get your appitite back. I'm on 50mg. On days i dont take it im like a walking zombie i dont feel like doing anything i cant concentrate and i will most likely eat all day long. I'm more activie when i do take it! I love it !,10,43
Vyvanse,"I'm writing a review to hopefully help others who haven't taken Vyvanse yet and want some information on what to expect. I felt REALLY uneasy and nervous prior to taking my first Vyvanse dose and it was honestly not worth the worry.  I started at 40mg to help with my ADHD. I read lots of reviews how it makes you feel high and super active. I felt a little bit of a buzz but not high. It was just a pleasant feeling of happiness. I'm sure it's different for everyone, but mine wasn't extreme. I also felt like I had more energy, but not enough to obsessively clean my house like others that left reviews.  Definitely take it early. It will keep you up otherwise. Only complaint so far!",9,41
Vyvanse,"Love this medicine! Tried all the others, Vyvanse definitely works the best. I stay on task, focused, more organized and been moving up in my field. 29 yr old female, 30mg dose. The only negative is if I don't take it for a day or 2 on the weekends then start again is at first it makes me real jittery and makes me go to the bathroom until my bowels are essentially cleaned out, but that's really not a bad thing. Also I love the way it curbs my appetite and keeps me around 115 lbs without even trying(I'm 5'3). A very pleasant side effect!! I was on 70 mg a couple years ago but I was getting a little too skinny(stable around 106-108 lbs), so decreased the dosage.",10,37
Vyvanse,"I am an older adult who started taking vyanese about three months ago. I had been feeling tired and had a hard time focusing on work. At night I would come home and did not feel like talking with my family. I didn't like interacting with people at work. This had been going on and developing for quite some time. (Over the course of about 10 years) i talked to my regular doctor and nothing, psychologists were worthless. After seeing a psychiatrist he prescribed me 30 mg of vyanese to take in the morning. What a difference this drug has made for me, able to focus, function better socially and just feel better. I'm 62.",10,54
Vyvanse,"56 yrs old. Tried Ritilin 15 years ago but stopped halway thru my first prescription because there was an edginess for me.  I've experienced too many jobs and excuses since then so i've just started on Vyvance. Its just four days but my mind is focussed, not hyper just comfortably clear. I'm very happy to be so productive. Eating well, sleeping well. I will add an update in a month.",8,36
Vyvanse,Been diagnosed with severe adhd as a child on all the generic medications ritalin aderall aderall xr. Decided to run my life without it and did well for a while til i became 25. As you get older adhd changes and involves more depression emotion and anger while still keeping your energy level and craziness. Vyvanse was prescribbed at a low dose and it is CLEARLY night and day on it.. Emotions are manageable and mind is clear.. One thought at a time. The lights in our mind do go out a tad. Its not so exciting in your own head anymore but you do gain a sense of control that is with ADHD dont even know exists. Some dry mouth and it will keep you up at night if you take it too late. But thats to be expected from amphetamines. Some loss of appeti,9,31
Vyvanse,Im 17 and a junior in high school he medicine gets the work done for me im so focused and makes me mkte focused but there is some things I don't like it makes my mouth super dry and makes me lose my appetite kinda sucks cause i wanna eat at lunch butcant cause it makes me wanna throw up and I've also lost weight because of the meds i think the pill is good they just need to fix the side effect,0,16
Vyvanse,"I am 28 years old. I'm a cook in an extremely fast paced, high profile kitchen needless to say celebritys love to have their weddings there. When I take my Vyvanse I can cook at a 100% capacity for the whole 8 hrs. Laser focused, good mood, feel I can do another 300 covers after we're done, don't need any help in the line. It's just wow. If you work in a place where you're under high pressure and quality is demanded this is your drug. I've always had ADD since I was small. My mother was too negligent to do anything about it I was a failure in high school and it really sucked. I would read things and be like  what? Lol I was bad now I take 60mg I take one around 1pm to help me through my work.",10,41
Vyvanse,I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DRUG! I like many of you really from what I have read had a great experience AT FIRST. I am 26 years old and do sales for a living. I was on cloud nine towards the beginning trail of this prescription. I was able to concentrate more than I had in months and was more motivated to go out and look for new leads for my company. I found that I would get dizzy or a tab nauseous but I found that staying hydrated and always having a water bottle with me helped out. I developed a problem where I would know what I wanted to say but when I went to speak it didn't come out right and literally made me sound like I was high or drunk. VERY SCARY!,1,40
Vyvanse,"First started off on 30 mg for ADHD and OCD. I have noticed a complete 180 in just two and a half weeks and not just with concentration but my mood of frustration and confusion. In beginning it did make me tired but that has gone and I've actually had have dose increase to 60 mg. Overall, great medication for me.",9,36
Vyvanse,"Worked great the first couple of days - concentrated, laser focus and able to work hard. A few days in, I felt like I was on speed - couldn't concentrate, thoughts racing, difficulty completing tasks. I couldn't stay on it, I was so anxious.",2,36
Vyvanse,"I had my college finals coming up and I couldn't get myself to concentrate so I got my doctor to prescribe it for me. I was able to concentrate but the thing is, I have a lot of anxiety, and by taking these pills, it just makes everything much worse. I got really anxious and upset at the end of each exam, even if I knew I did well. I never had this type of behaviour before taking the pills.",8,28
Vyvanse,"Not a good experience here. My 10 year old son was put on it. He started hallucinating, hearing voices, he was terrified. Uncontrollable crying. He couldn't be in a room alone. He was going into panic attacks because he was so scared. He didn't know why he was scared or why he couldn't stop crying.",2,51
Vyvanse,"Before Vyvance I had tried many other medications. It helped me quickly, I realized that I actually liked school and learning. Within weeks I went from failing to honors. But now that I'm older I realize that it alters my personality and my mood alot. And I find that when I dont have it I tend to feel like I am incapable of completing simple task.",8,70
Vyvanse,"At first I was a bit skeptical. This is my first time using any pill for ADHD. It took at least 2 hours to kick in, but when it did, I worked on 3 assignments non stop for 8 hours and my brain is still clicking. This really helped me!",9,42
Vyvanse,"26y/o male 5'9 170lb taking vyvanse for 6-7 years. Started with 30mg now on 60mg. I had previously been given everything else for ADHD but nothing stuck long term. Vyvanse has helped, coupled with regular exercise and healthy eating habits.",8,46
Vyvanse,It works but I am taking low dose because it decreases appetite.,7,32
Vyvanse,"I'm 17 years old and i have been taking vyvanse for 4 years now and i take 70mg. It works so well but the side effects are awful. My back, neck, and wrists hurt and i can't fall asleep and i have killer head aches and i have shortness of breath and i become socially awkward. Like typically im a very sociable person but when i take my meds i don't talk.",10,26
Vyvanse,"I'm on Vyvanse for ADD and social phobia. I also take 1 milligram of clonazepam, which helps with the anxiety stimulants may cause. In my experience, you'll crash and feel extremely anxious, depressed, and moody when taking anything less than 60 milligrams.",8,11
Vyvanse,"I'm 19 years old and started taking 50mg Vyvanse today, being diagnosed with ADD. So far today, i haven't any problems focusing and actually WANT to get my work done. It did take around 2 hours to start working, but there were no jitters. I never thought ADHD or ADD was a problem of mine, but it does run in my family.",8,41
Vyvanse,"I'm 42, highly successfully in my career and family life but always thought I had ADD or ADHD .  I got decent grades in high school and college but always felt like it was a struggle  and I would have to beat myself up for hours with guilt and fear of failure to produce even passing results.  After 20 years, I've decided to actually do something about it.  I tried both Adderall and Vyvanse and Vyvanse is superior because it's less harsh.  I've benefited from it but it does make me anxious..  I take Ativan to help with that..  I'm also on Brintellix. I hate being on tons of meds but if I can increase my quality of life and be a better person it's worth it.",9,41
Vyvanse,"LOVE IT. I took Strattera for 4 yrs but switched because of terrible nausea and anxiety. The first 3 months I had terrible migraines, lack of appitite &amp; trouble sleeping. Keep taking it daily to give body time to adjust. No side effects now and huge HUGE improvement in work, concentration and motivation.",10,59
Vyvanse,If you have social anxiety don't take more than 40 milligrams of Vyvanse because you'll be extremely anxious. I'd also suggest taking 0.25 milligrams of Klonopin in the afternoon to help with the moodiness and anxiety amphetamines cause as they wear off.,10,45
Vyvanse,I'm 25 years old and was diagnosed with ADD when I was about 8 years old and also have a processing problem as well. This is the 2nd day I am on it and on 20mg (lowest dose). It takes a little while to kick in but when it does I do get a little jittery (which is a side effect); which only lasts a few minutes.  I concentrate so much better with my online courses. when I was first diagnosed with ADD I was put on a medication that my mother said I wasn't the same person anymore and since then I was never medicated and struggled with the simplest things and also became depressed. If you have been diagnosed with ADHD/ADD I do suggest this for you and helps; with this med you aren't a zombie or foggy.,8,45
Vyvanse,"I have been on this med for 12 days, so far i haven't seen a difference, in fact I'm thinking my Dr gave me a placebo. I have been very tired and sleeping more. I have tried Dexedrine and Concerta which I feel, worked better, but was harsh. I hope in time I will see the benefits.",3,14
Vyvanse,"I can focus so much easier now, my thoughts are manageable and I can keep them straight in a way I never have before the only downsides are I am basically emotionless and it's difficult for me to let loose and have fun. Also another problem is when I miss a day I turn into a lunatic, like I am hyperactive, running on pure energy and unable to control what comes out of my mouth (thank God my teachers are cool!).",8,52
Vyvanse,"My son who is nine was just started on Vyvanse for ADD. He was not hyperactive just couldn't focus.  We struggled with from preschool to third grade. Held him back in first that helped a little. Then third grade about killed him. Medications were my last resort. Scared me to death to put him on medicines, 100% difference. Teacher said it was like a fog lifted. I'm like wow. Decreased appetite only side affect. But not bad.",10,185
Vyvanse,Cannot get to sleep. Extremely angry / irritated when first get up.,7,39
Vyvanse,"I'm 19 years old 4'11, small-framed, and I weigh 85 pounds. I didn't notice a great change in weight when I stopped it for one whole summer when I was 11. I just gained 4 more pounds. Nonetheless, I'm not underweight, bulimic, or anorexic. I've always been thin and petite. I'm on 60mg of Vyvanse for ADHD currently, but I've been prescribed it for awhile. What can I say about this medicine? It's great! Yes, it suppresses the appetite a little, and sometimes I have to force myself to eat.  This medication doesn't alter my personality oddly like Adderall. I'm still me, just more focused. My only complaint is that it mostly wears off in the evening when I need focus. I'm a singer too, so dry mouth is a side-effect that I could do without.",9,49
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse has changed my life, for the better. It gives me the motivation and confidence I need to complete tasks that otherwise would be daunting and unappealing. Talk to your doctor first to make sure you actually would benefit from it. The only down side is how expensive it can get if you're not covered.",10,65
Vyvanse,"Switched from Adderall to Vyvanse because I was experiencing negative side effects. Even on the smallest dose of Adderall I was anxious, had trouble with public speaking, and would have pretty bad mood swings. On Vyvanse I finally feel like a 'normal' person. My mom noticed a difference on the first day, and I no longer feel hopeless and discouraged while doing school work.",9,59
Vyvanse,"I have ADHD since I was very young. I've been on numerous different medications for it - Adderall XR, Concerta, Strattera, etc. Out of them all, Vyvanse has had the best results. Vyvanse helps me focus, get things done, act my age, and think before I act. I can focus on one thing at a time, rather than twenty things at once. One thing I have noticed about Vyvanse is that it treats my ADHD but doesn't take away from my personality. In other words, it doesn't make me feel like a zombie. I would definitely recommend Vyvanse to anyone with legitimate ADHD!",9,99
Vyvanse,"I'm 14 and diagnosed with ADHD when I was 4. But I started the 20mg medicine when I was 9. And I went from,F- to A's and B's in school.",0,124
Vyvanse,"High schooler, last year failed with D's and F's now I have A's and B's across the board. I'm taking 30mg of Vyvanse every morning, and it has turned my schooling in a complete 100% success. Only negative thing I can say, I've been having very short tempers. Anything can make me go off, I had it before taking medication but now it's more common for me to get very faster. Other than that no complaints! For a school setting this medicine is amazing.",8,55
Vyvanse,"Oh, if there was an 11, I would give Vyvanse this rating, if it was not for one side effect. But I am not 100% sure it is the Vyvanse.  I have been having pretty bad chest pains since I started on Vyvanse a couple of months ago. I even went to the ER for an asthma attack.  The trouble is, for the last few years (pre-ADHD diagnosis and any meds) I have been slowly growing into adult onset asthma. So it's tough even for the doctors to tell if it's from the asthma or the Vyvanse! The ER doc said no, Vyvanse shouldn't cause chest pains, so did my psychiatrist (who I trust and really respect). Long story short--I LOVE VYVANSE!! Has given me my life whole new meaning. I am the best version of myself.  My whole entire extended family notices!",9,84
Vyvanse,"I've been almost 3 years taking 30mg. Initially, it was sporadical. Now I just need it daily to function properly. Until one year ago I took Lexapro 10 mg   Xanax 1 or 2 mg/day. Now I had to increase Xanax to 4mg per day and sometimes Rohypnol to try to get some sleep. I feel really depressed and it's getting worse, also easily angry, that didn't occur when I took Lexapro but my psychiatrist didn't think it was necessary to take it any longer. I have to make major efforts to overcome suicidal thoughts. Have awful tremors and recently a unusual chest pain.",7,36
Vyvanse,"I have been on Vyvanse for 2 months now and started at 30mg. That did nothing at all. Then upped it to 40mg. I have headaches constantly, no appetite and constant mood swings. I'll go from happy to crying to just plain mean within minutes. If I'm not having mood swings then I'm pretty much emotionless. I also have manic depression and a severe  anxiety disorder. Vyvanse has done nothing but make my depression and anxiety worse, and now causing maritial problems.",0,67
Vyvanse,"I've tried so many medications that really did nothing for me except give me more mental problems. When I started on Vyvanse, I felt invincible. If you've ever watched the movie limitless, that's exactly how it feels! There was this short period of time that I took a break every now and then, do not do that! It made me chronically bipolar but I've started up on it and it really is the best medication you could have. If you wish to get off of it, I suggest you do so slowly and on days you don't have it, drink caffeine. It took me 6 months to not have that addictive feeling, now I'm back on it because I'm going back to school. It's up to you to say whether the side effects out way the epic benefits. It took me a while to figure that out. Good Luck!",10,72
Vyvanse,"I was not officially diagnosed with ADD until I was 30yrs old. I have been on Vyvanse for over 10 yrs now. I have had to increase my amount from 30 to 50 and have now been at 60 for over a year now. Sometimes I feel it causes irritability, but other than that only dry mouth. It has definitely helped with my attention disorder. It initially made me lose 10lbs and then leveled out. I have always been athletic except when my chronic pain is too bad. My son has ADHD and took Concerts for about 2 yrs. It helped tremendously with his anger and outburst and his grades. I only wish that my parents had me tested when I was younger as we did for my son. It would have taken away a lot of heartache! My daughter never suffered thankfully.",9,96
Vyvanse,"In England my mother took me to the doctor and being a nurse herself knew I had ADHD.  The doctors wanted to put me on Ritalin but my mother said no, I would grow out of it eventually. In the US my attention from high school through college became worse, and I got into a lot of trouble. My grades were horrible in high school through college, even work. I had to take classes two to three times over again. The only way I would remember daily things was to write it down.  Now at 41, I got help, and I am able to focus, complete tasks, remember without asking ten times, and sit still.  It's never too late for help.  Just wish I would of done this 35 years ago. My anger has subsided also with no side effects.",9,93
Vyvanse,"I failed 2 classes in high school, could pass the driver test, Struckout with girls because I was too hyper. Good at sports didn't play well at the best level. I was on Wellbritrin SR. Passed classes with C's and 1B, occasionally got a date to prom. Got sports scholarships throught T&amp;F, BBAll got a driver liscense.Things were missing got 16 on ACT, still little to hyper and struck out with college girls, passed 1st semester with 3C, 1A, couldn't remember street name. Doctor put me on Vyvanse 50 mg 3.0 GPA, got three dates, remember streets signs. Thank you GOD it is a blessings out of this world.",9,87
Vyvanse,"Was placed on Vyvanse after extreme weight loss on Adderall. Started at 20mg, upped to 40mg, then upped to 40mg 2x a day. I got my appetite back, but the medication really did nothing else for me. I went into rages and had huge anger problems for no reason. Anything could set me off! I could barely sleep or focus at work/school. Basically, I gained back the weight I had lost, but everything else sucked. I couldn't make it more than 6 months, my doctor switched me to Adderall XR.",2,44
Vyvanse,"I have been on ADD meds off and on for about 10 years. I'm 33 and before Vyvance I had tried Concerta and Adderrall. While the other two were ok, they did not benefit me nearly as much as Vyvance. In one semester I went from making a 50 on a College Algebra test to making a 100% on the comprehensive final. My professor said he had never seen anything like it, someone going from a 50 to 100. For the first time in my life I remembered to pay bills on time, I don't forget about the clothes in the washer for days, or forget to turn off the stove. I feel so much more accomplished!!",10,159
Vyvanse,My life has changed. I lived in the prison of my own mind which shackled me and withered my optimism like a flower deprived of water. But now I'm free. For the first time I know what it is like to want to do things and feel accomplished when they are done!,9,122
Vyvanse,"I am a male and 42 yrs old. I am an ASM in retail and a husband and father of four kids. The doctor prescribed 30 mgs the first two months and upped the meds to 40 mgs. I have only been on them for 5 months. I have seen and felt a huge change in my life style. I am more focused at home and especially at work. I am Mr. Mom and won't stop cleaning at home. I even cut and edge my neighbor's front yard. I lost 10 lbs and now weigh 197.  I do feel myself get upset faster though. Because I feel that, I also stop and calm myself down. So far I have no complaints....yet.",9,74
Vyvanse,"I am 13 years old I've been on Vyvanse for about 7 years. It really helps me focus and concentrate on things that are important, it also helps me know when and when not to do things like talk when some one else is talking.",10,111
Vyvanse,"I was prescribed Vyvanse to combat daily fatigue caused by autonomic dysfunction. It treats those symptoms very well, but prolonged use has a large impact on my mood and personality. By the 2nd week, I was feeling very sad all day every day. A strange side effect that I encountered was that it made my armpits quite literally drip with sweat. The only other bothersome side effect is that it initially kept me up until 5/6 am, but that was remedied with 0.1mg Clonidine before I went to bed. I'm sure this medicine works very well for those with ADD and ADHD, as that is what it is designed for. If you are looking for a solution to chronic fatigue caused by autonomic dysfunction, you may want to consider other options.",9,22
Vyvanse,Awesome care for my child,10,15
Vyvanse,"I am 60 years old and a career woman who has always struggled with completing tasks despite working long hours. Had recently succombed to depression and loss of self esteem because I was feeling I was no longer capable of performing my job because of age. Suffered this feeling most of my life,  been in therapy and was usually prescribed antidepressants or SSRI inhibitors to treat my symptoms but never cause of my symptoms. I did not even know adults could suffer from ADD. FINALLY a therapist took the time to treat the cause of my lifelong struggle instead of merely sedating me.  MY LIFE HAS CHANGED!! MY JOB PERFORMANCE AND PERSONAL LIFE HAS IMPROVED. I ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THINGS.  Why so late in life?",10,136
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse 60mg ( 19 years old, 138 lbs ) Suffered of ADD since I was 7 years old. Never consulted before, I am now 19 years old. I just got my first prescription, I always had issue with my grades and I always had to work 5 times more than every other student for the same grade. Today after my first pill I just realized that in a normal condition my brain was only working at only 20% of its full capacity when studying, reading, driving or even in sexual relation (I had erectile dysfunction) and today with the pill I just felt invincible and in a super good mood (not understanding what you're studying or simply reading is just depressing). The pill made effect after 1 hour and it last approximately 10-12 hours. I really recommend Vyvanse.",10,75
Vyvanse,Consistent control of symptoms all day.,8,28
Vyvanse,"Very smooth stimulant. Effective for a little over 8 hours in my experience, not the 12 or 13 hours the manufacturer claims. I take 40mg and have for over a month and have no need to up the dose. I gave it 9/10 instead of 10/10 because it takes 2 to 3 hours to start working. But there is no crash and is incredibly smooth compared to IR Adderall, Focalin or Ritalin. I also have an prescription for 10mg IR Adderall to take at 5pm so after work I can study or work out or just be productive because by 5pm the Vyvanse has totally worn off.",9,54
Vyvanse,"I have been taking 30mg of Vyvanse for one week now. It works great. The first day I could really feel the amphetamine and found it too strong and unpleasant but on day 2 I did not feel bad from it. It lasts long, probably 12-14 hours and is very smooth. The crash is relatively mild. Previously I have been on dexamphetamine IR 3x10mg/day for one month which worked really well, but I wanted something that is sustained released. Before that I was on Ritalin IR and LA for over 15 years. The Methylphenidate just did not work as well as it used to and I found the side effects more and more unpleasant.  I can really recommend Vyvanse so far. I am really calm from it and can focus very well on tasks. It also has less cardiac side effects than others.",9,44
Vyvanse,"It's good during the day for my attention but I have to force myself to eat, I've had bad headaches..probably from not eating enough. Also as the evening progresses I notice I start feeling moody and depressed. I sometimes cry over the most silliest things. I also notice my appetite comes back later in the night as well. Which could turn into a bad thing with weight gain. Normally can't fall asleep till around 2-3am every night. I know there seems to be more cons than pros but overall I rate Vyvanse a 7 due to the fact my mind isn't all over the place, when someone is talking to me I'm actually listening. I seem to be in a better mood during the day..night time is my downfall!",0,49
Vyvanse,"My 8yr old daughter has been on Vyvanse for almost 2yrs. She started on 20mg a day, she seemed to be doing better as far as focusing, but very emotional. Her doctor decided to up her dose to 30mg and now 40mg. The 40mg also seemed to help at school her grades went up and she was able to pay attention. I'm now noticing that my little girl is not the same person, she's has become rude, depressed, emotional, getting in trouble, suicidal and just out of control. Parents really should keep a journal of changing side effects they notice. Needless to say my daughter is no longer taking this medication and not yet found one to replace it.",2,80
Vyvanse,"I wouldn't typically give any drug such a high rating, but Vyvanse has truly changed my life with few if any side effects. I take 20 mg once a day, and it lasts 12 to 14 hours. It took about 2 weeks of trial and error to find the dosage, but it was very worthwhile. I am happier, less anxious, and significantly more organized than I have ever been. I am a student and many areas of my life--academics, social functioning, general health, etc.--have all improved greatly. The inattentive fog has cleared, and I finally feel able to create the life I want to be living. Better control over my life has also given me back self-esteem and stabilized my moods. I am so grateful.",10,78
Vyvanse,"12 hours, 140 mg.",10,4
Vyvanse,"I have always done well in school, but my time management, organizational skills, motivation, and overall thought/idea clarity have lacked.  I went back to college at 29 to finish 2 year degree, and decided to finish 4 year while I am at it.  I was diagnosed with ADHD this past fall, and put on Adderall IR then XR, then back to IR because it just didn't work that well, and quite frankly it made me too anxious at times.  Dr. at school just put me on 30 mg of Vyvanse as an alternative to Adderall, and it works very well.  I worry about drug interactions but it works great and I'm incredibly focused on my everyday tasks with this medication.",9,34
Vyvanse,"I have been on Vyvanse for almost 2 years and have had no major symptoms. I had dry mouth, but that pretty much subsided. I did lose about 30lbs, but I'm 5'9 and was weighing about 240lbs, so it wasn't as bad thing. I have ADHD, I started this medicine when I was almost 40. I'm almost 42 and really have had a great experience. My son is on it for ADD, and my daughter for ADHD. She was just tested and accepted into the gifted program and he is 2 years younger and has had significant improvements to his grades and behavior. I would recommend.",10,65
Vyvanse,"This medicine made my anxiety worse. While I was very focused, I had a bad month while I was using this.",3,22
Vyvanse,"I really want parents to take a good look at what they may be about to give their children before they do so. If dopamine deficient; Vyvanse will initially appear to be amazing. Until a tolerance is built up when it will leave a person feeling as low/moody and agitated as they ever have. Recent studies indicate that mood disorders may mask themselves as ADD/ADHD. If you or your child is experiencing any of the major or severe emotional side effects of this or other stimulants; please consider that it could be mood disorders brought on by a dopamine deficiency. This is what happened to me and because I was aware of the symptoms of dependency and mood disorder, I recognized it immediately.",10,68
Vyvanse,"My daughter is taking Vyvance and she is seeing people following her, she thinks her phone is being tapped and she believes there are people monitoring her entire behavior. This is a really freaky side effect! She has a predisposition for Mental disease.",3,43
Vyvanse,"I used to sleep for like 12 to 24 hours straight very often for 2 years. I would sometimes fall asleep at work at dinner time. That caused me to be inattentive, distracted and sometimes more rarely sugar high hyperactivity sort of speaking. Now ever since then my problem is solved I can get up early and perform my task like normally so it works very well for both narcolepsy and ADD/ADHD. It could even work for depressed subjects. It should be obvious enough that you're all set to go whether its to go to school and working at same time or full time job.",9,33
Vyvanse,"Was on Concerta 18mg for 3 years worked great. Stopped taking it, felt like I didn't need it anymore and I didn't want to pay for it then. Wasn't doing so well professionally or at home not getting chores done feeling real lazy etc. so I went back on the Concerta couldn't feel it this time bumped up to 36mg still most days didn't feel a difference tried Vyvanse definitely can feel motivation only doesn't seem to last as long as Concerta used to for me but I feel happy on Vyvanse, just wished it lasted longer also as a lot of people say less anxiety. I can say I don't have an anxiety problem on Concerta or on Vyvanse but Vyvanse feels like it has anti-anxiety medicine built into. I feel real comfortable where ever I go.",9,42
Vyvanse,"40mg Vyvanse kept me awake all day, however, from the moment I took the 30mg dose I could stay awake and focused for 12 hours strait and still sleep at night. If I had this medicine in High School my life today would be 100% different. I would have excelled in academics and done much better sports.",10,66
Vyvanse,"After trying Ritalin, Concerta, Adderall. This medicine changed everything. I am organized and focused for first time in my life, I'm 38. Only draw back is it last about 6 hours for me not 12. But 6 productive hours, actually finishing things is better than I've ever had!",9,46
Vyvanse,My seven year old son is on it and he is so emotional. One minute he is fine the next he is crying and can't stop. As a mother this is very hard to deal with. I can't help him and he asking why is he feeling this way. I am going to have to stop giving him the medicine.,3,47
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse has changed my life in the best way! It's almost like a motivation pill.  I can spend 12 hours in the library at a time studying, with little distractions. I made a 4.0 my first semester of college. I used to always want to work hard and study but could never quite pull it together, and with Vyvanse I can! The only downside is the dehydration. Remember to drink lots of water or you will get headaches!",9,61
Vyvanse,I've found that Vyvanse combined with Effexor works quite well for me.  Being focused and calm is a great way to live life!,0,38

Vyvanse,"I was diagnosed with ADHD, this year, at age 20 as a Sophomore in college.  Vyvanse is the first and only medication I have ever taken to treat my ADHD. Pre Vyvanse, I had a cumulative 3.5 gpa in my first two semesters of college.  Post Vyvanse after 1 semester of taking it, I got a 3.62 GPA. While my GPA didn't increase tremendously, I did notice that I could pay attention in class a lot better and that I was learning a lot more. On Vyvanse, I can easily put 12 hours in the library if needed and be way more organized. I recently obtained an internship for Xmas break, and I wouldn't be able to work 60+ hours behind a desk per week without it. Vyvanse has made a difference in my life.",8,45
Vyvanse,"I've tried others ADHD meds. I always come back to this one. It works the best. Downside, it's so expensive.",9,24
Vyvanse,"I was diagnosed with ADD/ADHD when I was 21. I had failed out of university, I was unorganized, felt like a failure, and was frankly quite depressed. Vyvanse helped me focus and think more typically, and I was better able to do my school work. I'm about to graduate with a GPA of 3.8 and my heart is set on a masters degree!  My only issue with this medicine is the moodiness I experience when coming off from it every single evening. I try to be doing something alone at this time, since it only lasts an hour or so, but I become very introverted and irritable. I also found that I'm crazy tired in the morning and sleep in. I used to be up at six thirty every morning! But the benefits far outweighs the cost.",9,37
Vyvanse,"I am a junior in high school who was just diagnosed with both severe ADD and ADHD. I go to a pretty good high school where I achieved around a 3.2 last year (generally get a 3.6 but last semester of my sophomore year I got like a 2.7). After I got on Vyvanse my GPA went up to around a 4.0 and I am in mostly honors and AP classes. Although I was always thought to be smart and nobody ever denied that, they would say I was lazy and unorganized and simply didn't apply myself. Now I get A's without effort, my teachers love me, I hardly have to pay attention, and I also have a love for school/my subjects that I didn't have before. I am now excited to go to school and function on a much higher level. I would most definitely recommend Vyvanse.",10,53
Vyvanse,I started taking Vyvanse about 2 weeks ago. I am 14 years old I have noticed a huge difference and school and my grades have good from d's and f's to a's and b's. I LOVE YOU VYVANSE,8,36
Vyvanse,I have a 16yr old son who was put on Vyvanse for his ADHD 3yrs ago. It worked good for awhile made better grades in school. He had less impulsivity and was able to focus more. He had decreased appetite and needed to be put on another medicine to help him sleep. In the past year his grades went down. He was already on the highest dose of 70mg. He was becoming aggressive and very hateful. I found out that he was smoking weed and drinking. He told me he felt so jittery from his Vyvanse that was the only way he could relax. I put my son in a rehab and they switched him to Strattera and he is doing a lot better.,5,29
Vyvanse,"I didn't get diagnosed with ADHD until 7th grade. The switch from elementary school to middle school just dramatically failed. My mom always wondered if I had it but I guess just convinced herself I didn't until 7th grade. I went, fell asleep from not having interest in a dark room all by myself with a computer that I had to press a button whenever the small dot in the middle turned to a triangle for 2 hours. Anyways. I started on Adderal taking 20mg 3 times a day, increasing by 10mg every semester up until sophmore year. My doctor recommended Vyvanse because I hated taking so many pills so many times a day. Bottom line is I am on 80mg of Vyvanse and 30mg of Adderal/day. VYVANSE IS A MIRACLE!",0,24
Vyvanse,"My name is Sydney and I'm 17 junior in high school. I started Vyvnase in Feb. this year. I started out on 30 mg, then went up every ten mg and now im prescribed 60mg. In the first week I was using Vyvanse I noticed a huge difference in everything. I could focus so much more on every thing. Comparing my 1st semester and 2nd semester of high school last year, I had an F and failed one class and had mostly B's and C's. My second semester of last school year when I started taking the Vyvanse my grades increased amazingly. Almost all A's and B's.  Since I suffer from ADD, Vyvanse has made such a great impact on my life.",10,29
Vyvanse,"I stated taking Vyvanse on July 18, 2013. Stated off at 30 mg and worked my way up to 60 mg. the medicine has changed my life in a GREAT way! The only bad part is when it starts to wear off I begin to get moody again... I wish it'll last a bit longer!!!! But overall... Thank you Vyvanse!!!!!!",0,29

Vyvanse,"My 9 y/o daughter was taking this. Started on a 30 MG dose then we kept moving up to 50. The 50 only seemed to make her aggressive at home with her sister and acting odd. Her school also commented that she has not change AT ALL even with the increase in dosage. This is the first ADD medication we have taken so maybe its not the one for her but, frustrating never the less.",6,23
Vyvanse,"My son is 10 and I have known for a long time he had inattentive ADHD, but his school didn't want to help me get a diagnosis, and I was trying to tell myself he didn't have it. He changed schools this year, now a 5th grader, and I happened to ask his teacher how his attention and focus was. He was unfocused during the day. They did a time on task and it showed he was 40% more off task than his peers during different times in the day. His teacher and I filled out the normal forms which ask how unfocused rating 1-5 etc. and our answers were near identical. His doctor saw the info and sure enough, an ADHD diagnosis.  He was put on 20mg Vyvanse just this week, and he seems so much more focused!",8,38
Vyvanse,"I wasn't a hyperactive kid. I have a high IQ (not bragging- just got genetically lucky there), so no one ever thought I had ADD, including me. However, looking back I never could get homework done on time. My backpack, school binder &amp; bedroom were always a mess. As an adult I learned many organizational skills, but continued to struggle terribly with lack of motivation, focus &amp; enjoyment in life, despite living in abundant material comfort. When I started taking 30mg of this a day at my doctor's urging, it was as if a bright light flooded what had previously only been utter darkness in my brain for 30  years. There's no buzz to this medicine. It's simply a means to reaching a more positive mindset that I thought I was barred from forever.",9,167
Vyvanse,When it comes to stimulants Vyvanse was the greatest one I've ever taken. I could do tasks and talk to people I even started jogging every day. It wore off nicely so I wouldn't get anxiety. After upping my dose to 40mg I started over thinking everything and eventually had full blown anxiety attacks at work (embarrassing). I was bummed about that because I really liked them. Great for those who want a stimulant that gradually wears off.,0,34
Vyvanse,"Most awesome medicine I've ever been prescribed. I can focus, I am not irritable. I feel like I have a life now. Thank you Vyvanse.",10,51
Vyvanse,"My child is young teen girl with autism or Asperger's, recently diagnosed with ADHD due to impulsivity. Very bright and attentive normally but trouble with transitions, outbursts, interrupting, slow processing speed, getting agitated and not being able to calm down, lack of awareness of surroundings, misunderstanding others' signals, sensory overload. Responding well to Vyvanse 30mg. Easier transitions, speaks more fluently without stammering, less agitated, less angry, much more cooperative and calm, able to converse without interrupting or changing topics, happier, feels better about self. Side effects are dizziness with exertion worst when changing position from sitting to standing, needs more sleep, mild headaches, weight loss.",9,46
Vyvanse,"I LOVE this, wish they had higher doses. I am way more effective and way more responsive at work and at home. I was worried about being dependent on it but it gave me my life back, plus I'm now sleeping better and feeling more rested.",10,32
Vyvanse,"I am a 43 yo mom of 2 (3 if you count my husband). I can't stress enough how much Vyvanse has completely changed my life. I was diagnosed with ADD after my oldest received her diagnosis about 10 yrs ago. I've tried Adderall, Concerta, &amp; the like and even on high doses, NEVER experienced the clarity &amp; energy I've gotten on just 20mg of Vyvanse. I've just started taking it 2 weeks ago &amp; wish I had discovered this medicine years ago! The only issue is that this week I titrated up to 30mg and have noticed some irritability, so I think I'll go back to the lower dose.  Love, love, LOVE my new lease on life thanks to Vyvanse!",10,74
Vyvanse,I'm 29. I was first diagnosed when I was in the second grade. I first started being medicated when I was 11. Doctors tried Ritalin and I was maxed out then I was switched to Desoxyn then Adderall as a pre-teen then Strattera and Effexer. I stopped taking my meds then after my father passed away I lost it and my mother had heard about NEW miracle ADHD medicine. She begged me to talk to my therapist about it. My therapist was on board as well so I mentioned it to my psych. I have been taking Vyvanse for 4 years. I wish it was around when I was a child. Growing up wouldn't have been so hard. Thank you so very much Vyvanse.,10,51
Vyvanse,"26 y/o female who was diagnosed with ADHD at 15. My parents chose not to treat it with medication. As an adult in college- I got made fun of in good humor by friends about how much I studied. I couldn't concentrate, remember, mind wander and jump to something else &amp; hyper. Tried Adderall instant and XR. My husband said both made me mean and irritable. Plus I lost 10 pounds before our wedding (already underweight). It increased my anxiety, I hated it. My psychiatrist switched me to Vyvanse 30mg. Wow! No mood swings, no appetite changes, can concentrate, less anxiety because it evens me out.  I feel alive and normal!",10,42
Vyvanse,"I'm 17 and been on Vyvance for about two years. I had always had a really hard time paying attention in class and getting any kind of work done, so my mom took me to the Dr and he diagnosed me with severe ADD. He put me on Strattera and I was good on it, until they upped my dosage. I'm normally a really happy, easy going person, do not get mad easily AT ALL, but on the Strattera, I was moody and was having nightmares, couldn't sleep. So he put me on Ritalin. It was the same as the Strattera, moody, nightmares, and the added increased heart rate. So finally, the Dr said he was going to try Vyvanse. I was really scared because of the past experiences, but I tried it. I slept, felt good, and am able to focus!",10,36
Vyvanse,"I have ADD not ADHD.. I'm not hyper.. But, my grades were so low I barley had a chance of passing my sophomore year, but I noticed I had such a hard time concentrating all these years and always just tried forcing myself to concentrate but it never really did work.. So we went and got tested and I had a lot of tests done on me and my brain, actually.. And the hypothalamus in my brain was not working correctly and was not sending many signals to my nervous system.. And that was the cause of ADD.. My doctor then prescribed my Vyvanse and the first day I was on it I was overly concentrated and very mixed up... My eyes felt huge and I felt like I was tripping to be honest.. But after I got used to it I got 80s and 90s in my classes and passed:)",10,16
Vyvanse,"I cannot stress enough how thankful I am for this medication. I had always been a very smart kid but my drive and focus would come in very short bursts if I was interested otherwise I could not have cared less. I was prescribed 30mg of Vyvanse initially and that was upped to 50mg which I have been taking for over a year now. My grades went from a 3.2 GPA to a 4.0 within a semester. I excelled at work. I am a more alert driver. Like everyone else has said, I feel as if my thoughts are all organized the way they always should have been and I am finally able to catch up on life, which always seemed out of reach. I strongly prefer this medication over Adderall IR which I tried. There are no negative side effects except insomnia.",10,56
Vyvanse,"I'm 11 and I take it. Before I got in trouble a lot, but now I'm fine.",10,50
Vyvanse,"I started taking Vyvanse 2 weeks ago and it has helped with my focus, patience, anxiety and depression. My doctor tells me I have a mix of ADD/ADHD so he prescribed me on 50mg. I am worried though about all of these side effects I have been hearing about that could happen. The only side effects I have gotten is bruising easily and loss of appetite in which i force myself to eat because I end up feeling like I will pass out. Other than that I highly recommend vyvanse!",8,13
Vyvanse,"I have realized after my child started taking Vyvanse, her grades improved dramatically! She is able to concentrate and pay attention to what is going on instead of being confused. This medication has been working great for her and we have not had to up the dosage. It was very scary at first, however, it turned out to be a great decision.",9,53
Vyvanse,"My 5 year old son was prescribed Vyvanse as his first medication after being diagnosed with ADHD-combined type and we've seen a huge difference in his attitude already. He is so polite, much calmer (but not zombied), still has his personality and is active. He's become more aware of his surroundings and how to treat others around him appropriately. I can't wait for school to start again to see how well his social relationships will improve now that he's undergoing treatment. Side effects the first few days were not nice to watch but he adjusted and is doing awesome. No insomnia or appetite loss either, and he has no complaints; it's perfect for him!",9,71
Vyvanse,"I adore Vyvanse. It totally improves my quality of life keeping me energized, making me think more clearly and putting me in the happiest mood ever. Different medications work better for different people, but I very highly recommend Vyvanse.",10,35
Vyvanse,"I'm 23 and have tried just about every ADHD medication out there. I've been on Vyvanse for some time now and it's great! I have energy, I can focus at work and school. It lasts the entire day and then some. The only drawback is you won't eat. You'll be hungry your stomach will growl but you can't eat. Sleeping is tough because it's a stimulant so I was put on sleep meds to help. You might have a jittery feeling and increased heart rate at first. It takes about an hour or so to kick in but it's a fantastic medicine. It's also very powerful. All you gotta do is NOT take it past 2pm at absolute LATEST or you'll lie awake forever in bed. Eat prior to ingesting because you won't eat later. It's great, try it!",10,49
Vyvanse,"I'm 33 and have struggled with ADHD for as long as I can remember.  I was prescribed Vyvanse for the first time 6 months ago.  I noticed a huge difference within just a couple days.  Unlike Ritalin and Adderall, I'm not moody and it actually works the entire day.  My focus and concentration has improved greatly and so has my quality of life.   The only drawbacks are that I've noticed a decreased appetite and usually it takes an hour or two to kick in.  I don't take it on weekends to help avoid developing a tolerance (this was per my physician's advice) and I seem to be restless at night on days when I don't take it.   But overall, Vyvanse has helped me more than any other ADHD medication I've ever been on.  Strongly recommended!",9,58
Vyvanse,"We switched on the advice of the then new ADHD therapist.  It took longer to kick in and build up than other meds we tried but it has been a God send.  His grades are WAY up and he's not as hot or cold as he used to be.  My only issues are he won't eat while on it...not even a tiny bite.  Dr is keeping an eye on the weight.  Also, to me, he's not himself.  I don't like the flatness because his personality is so big!  At least it wears off!",9,33
Vyvanse,"Been on this medication for about three years now, has improved my quality of life so much?!",10,28
Vyvanse,"I am 17 and have been taking this since 8th grade. I was diagnosed because I would get into trouble all the time and when I first started taking it, it was great. I stopped getting into trouble and so on. Now, 4 years later I feel it is completely different. Rapid heart rate, anger, don't care mood, dizziness, but it still makes me focused. I'm tying to get off it, but making slow progression because I'm really ADHD, my friends concur. The crash after taking it for so long feels like dementia. I only take it on weekdays and could relate to insomnia because I getless than 30 hours of sleep a week.",6,32
Vyvanse,"Though told stories by family how ACTIVE I have always been, despite its' negative tone, I always thought ACTIVE was positive. Now 44 with 2 children, a husband, my 5 year old was diagnosed with ADHD. With her diagnosis, came mine. I take 40mg of Vyvanse in the morning and it allows me to focus in the way I have always strived to. With it, I achieve my goals more comfortably, but I make sure I eat before taking it, drink a lot of water and try to exercise. It is not a magic pill and it is still essential to use the coping strategies I developed from years of having to cope on my own. My only concern is my heart and blood pressure. Overall, this is a solid, good medication that allows for a more balanced life.",8,46
Vyvanse,"I work in a call center and I was made aware of my hyperness and also that I was speaking way too fast to our customers on the phone. In reality I always knew I was a bit loud with my voice and with my actions. I was diagnosed with ADHD and placed on Vyvanse and to my surprise my world changed I am able to focus not just at work but in my life as well. I feel like every thing has been placed in order. Things make sence to me and I love the feeling. I am glad to have this medication in my life, and I don't see myself as ever going back to living the way I was.",10,37
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse is great.  It has a longer dosing window than Adderall XR (12 vs 8 hours for me) and a slightly improved side-effect profile.  As a longtime (~16 years) prescription stimulant user, for ADHD, I would recommend Vyvanse to any user that is currently unsatisfied with their ADHD management.  It is no silver bullet, but there are no silver bullets for ADHD.  It is incremental innovation in a great way. Vyvanse is the first real stimulant to reduce side effects without cutting efficacy.",9,29
Vyvanse,"I have just started using Vyvanse a couple days ago. Even though I haven't been on it for very long, I already notice some differences in my everyday life. Almost everything has changed for the greater good. The only bad thing I have to pick on is that I have experienced a multitude of side effects such as headaches, rapid heart beats, and dizziness. Other than that, I like Vyvanse so far. My opinion in the future may or may not change, but most likely not. The effects of Vyvanse are pretty immediate, for me at least. It has also come to my attention that some people don't notice any change sometimes.",8,16
Vyvanse,"My 11 yr old daughter has taken Vyvanse for about 3 yrs now for her ADHD.  She was taking Strattera for 2 yrs before that.  We have had constant issues with anger, mood swings, and depression, on both medications but she seems to be able to focus better in school with Vyvanse.  Here for the past few months it has gotten to where she says she feels out of control of her emotions and wants to die.  All her doctors have done is increased her dosage, paired it up with Intuniv, and now have her on a mood stabilizer.  We are waiting to see how this all goes.  I do not know if Vyvanse is the problem, if ADHD meds are part of the problem, or if she has a different chemical imbalance that needs treated along with her ADHD.",0,33
Vyvanse,"My 15 year old son stated taking a 50mg dose of Vyvanse last spring.  We were elated with the initial response.  His attitude and outlook improved greatly, and performance at school improved.  His appetite dropped off too.  After 6 weeks of taking daily doses he began vomiting.  We ended up taking him off this medication because of the vomiting.",3,28
Vyvanse,"I am a 50 y/o f just recently diagnosed with ADHD. My 32 y/o was diagnosed just 2 or 3 yrs ago. I have always been forgetful, impatient, unable to focus, misplaced items, etc. I went back to college 2 1/2 yrs ago and did excellent, but it was very hard even though I studied and knew the material it was the same in HS. I realized something was changing in my ability to learn and saw a doc on adults w/ADD &amp; ADHD, realized it was hereditary, got tested and BAM. I've been on the initial 30 mg a day for a month. I feel sure doc will increase the dosage due to how long it lasts. But, It's GREAT, completely changed my life. I have a small decrease in appetite, must take it early to negate insomnia otherwise, awesome med.",9,39
Vyvanse,I am a high school student (10 grade). Today was my first day taking Vyvanse and I feel like a totally different person! I was very stressed about school because I couldn't concentrate and making bad grades isn't fun so it made me a little depressed. I noticed that I actually felt like doing work (never thought that would happen) and instead of finishing my episode of Teen mom 2 I was eager to do my homework instead! At night I got about an hour of sleep then was up for about 8 hours until it was time to go to school and I forgot to eat the whole day it's just food didn't sound good at all and it gave me so much energy especially because we had to run the mile at school and I ran it very fast because it changes your whole mindset.,9,26
Vyvanse,"I have been diagnosed with ADHD since I was 6. I am now 26 years old and just 3 years ago I wanted to be retested just to make sure if I even still have ADHD as bad as I did when I was a kid and of course it hasn't toned down. I have taken Ritalon and it made me very angry at night and a zombie by day. I have also taken Adderral, which I like and maybe might switch back. Vyvanse really helps me focus gives me a positive attitude and more energy but I get the worst migraines at night every night. Ritalin gave me headaches as well and I can barely sleep. I thought maybe I needed a new mattress so I bought a great one and still waking up a thousand times a night. It has its pros and cons like everything else.",9,28
Vyvanse,"So far so good, I recently started Vyvanse and it has been wonderful I am really seeing a difference. The only side effect I have experienced is dry mouth and I did not drink enough water anyway so I have had a very positive experience.",10,25
Vyvanse,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid. I've tried all sorts of medications, (two type of Adderall and I don't even remember what else). Around two years ago, my doctor decided to switch me to Vyvanse. It is effective, I won't lie, but the side effects make it less than desirable. I am a 17 year old on a 7 year old's dosage and it still causes me to have mood swings, become irritable and antisocial, and kills my appetite. If I happen to be stressed out, on my period, and on Vyvanse on the same time (both tantrums and objects will be thrown). I've taken to using it on an as needed basis. It's not as effective this way, and my doctor doesn't like it, but at least I can balance academics and a social life this way.",8,28
Vyvanse,"I am a 23 year old female, recently diagnosed with ADD.  Thanks to my amazing doctor, he discovered my problem was actually not anxiety (like I've been told my entire life), but actually ADD.  Makes complete sense.  Always been a horrible student, and have had to work my butt off in college.  Vyvanse is amazing:  gives me energy, do not have to nap every day, my thoughts and emotions are very thought out, have already improved in school.  I actually hear people when they talk to me now!  I am much more social, relaxed, and confident.  I feel like myself with Vyvanse.  Only downfall- makes me really tired when it wears off in the evening and I cannot drink more than 1 or 2 cups of coffee during the day, or else I get very anxious!",9,55
Vyvanse,This worked amazing with my son. Our biggest problem was he didn't want to eat and lost a lot of weight.,9,24
Vyvanse,"I was on Ritalin/Concerta since I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 6 (I am now 18). I switched to Strattera last September, and that was horrible, didn't do a thing for my ADHD.  I went back on Concerta, but noticed it wasn't working as well. My psychiatrist switched me to Vyvanse 40mg in the morning, and I immediately noticed the benefits, 100% better than Concerta and 400000% better than Strattera.  Only side effects is lack of appetite but I am welcoming that side effect because I also suffer from binge eating disorder. It helps my concentration immensely (I suffer with severe ADHD, to the point it's hard to have a conversation without zoning out and not listening). Vyvanse is a life saver!",10,58
Vyvanse,"My 7 year old was placed on this for ADHD. Although it did wonders for his academic progress as if a light was instantly turned on. His personality changed. He went from occasional outbursts to full blown temper tantrums, hitting, swearing. Like he was posessed by the devil. He couldn't sleep for days. Needless to say he is off it. We are now trying foclain. Not as many emotional problems. But not as focused. We'll hopefully find the right one.",3,35
Vyvanse,"I started taking this my senior year in high school, and after 6 months on it, my GPA has come up at least 1 point! I take it during the week, and I have no problems with headaches or loss of appetite, and it helps wake me up and keep me up. I love it!",10,24
Vyvanse,This medication has increased my school performance greatly! I have experienced the weight loss and lower libido ALOT. But overall it's really great. I needed to lose weight anyway...,10,22
Vyvanse,"My 9 year old son has been on Vyvanse  for five years now he started out with 20mg he is now up to 70mg it works great my 5yr old little girl was just put on Vyvanse 40mg after trying numerous other ADHD medicines. It works well, I was on Ritalin for 25 years. I did not want my kids on that so glad the Vyvanse works.",10,33
Vyvanse,"I am a 30 year old woman, recently diagnosed with ADD.  I always knew there was an issue there because I have always been extremely irritable/short-fused, indecisive, impatient, impulsive, forgetful, anxious, etc.  I somehow busted my butt through school and even managed to get my Bachelors degree but this came with re-reading lines of texts, taking several breaks while studying, and telling myself to focus constantly.  I usually stare at someone talking but don't know what was said because I was thinking of something else completely.  I couldn't remember movies or conversations to save my life.  Docs said it was anxiety and increased the dose constantly.  At 30mg and 4 days on Vyvanse, I feel great.  Only headaches here and there but I'm hopeful!",9,82
Vyvanse,"I am productive but I am not myself, I can't sleep.  I stay up for days on end because there is so much I have to do.  My body just wants rest, my pulse is pounding behind my eyes.  I can't remember the last time my body or my mind allowed me to eat, hunger is a distant memory.  I am gregarious in conversations and go off like Charlie Sheen.  I have stayed up for days, until white walls turned orange.  I have been on Vyvanse for a year and before that Medidate, Stratera, Concerta, Daytrana, Ritalin, Adderall.  I don't know who I am outside of my daily dose because I've been fed since I was 9, I'm 21 now. I have a 4.0 GPA, I am miserable. None of these are good, the alternative is worse.",8,70
Vyvanse,"After entering into a rigorous educational program where I am in the operating room for hours at a time, I realized I needed to see my doctor for my ADHD. I first tried Adderall XR. I had severe side effects, nearing a heart attack. I went back to the doctor and was prescribed Vyvanse. I also have a history of anxiety and some depression. Vyvanse has been amazing! I can focus and my anxiety is nearly gone. I will say that I had more focus with Adderall, but an unnecessary amount of focus. I feel normal on Vyvanse, like I am not on medication. My heart rate does increase during the first couple of hours. I also have to time the dose just right or I will either not sleep or the meds will wear off too soon.",8,69
Vyvanse,"I am a 17 year old junior and I started taking Vyvanse in 9th grade. I'm not saying it doesn't work because I went from any average student to where B's are a disappointment to my mom. But I haven't had much of a social life anymore, the people at my lunch table think I'm anorexic and I don't sleep most nights. I get headaches constantly and I'm tired of this. I tried other medicines but my mom said nothing works as good.",3,46
Vyvanse,"Then put me on 20mg, and now I am on 40 mg. Throughout this whole trial, I have noticed a huge difference. I do have less appetite like everyone else does. But that don't bother me. I am over weight already. I also concentrate way better. I am much happier during the day and my patience has increased. He did put me on Lexapro for my anxiety and that is all going good as well.",9,32
Vyvanse,My daughter has inattentive ADHD.,9,9
Vyvanse,"I am 17 years old, I've always had a problem focusing in school. Eventually I was taken to get tested and I did in fact have A.D.D . My doctor started me on 50mg of Vyvanse. My first day taking the pill was amazing and so was that whole 2 weeks. Its now my third week on Vyvanse and I've been having rapid heart rates, blurred vision, and feeling very jittery/shaky. I'm curious if my dosage is too high for me. I'm also afraid that if I get my dosage lower that it will no longer work for me.",5,34
Vyvanse,"My 7 yr old daughter just started taking Vyvnase 40mg in the morning after 7 yrs of avoiding medications, she has completely slowed down and is able to focus. My only concern is her having dry mouth and biting on the inside of her jaw, this is her first day hopefully it just needs a few days to adjust. BIG difference already. I hope this is all we need and it continues to get better.",5,30
Vyvanse,"I just started taking Vyvanse today and have already seen an outstanding improvement! I am an 18 year old mother that struggled throughout high school, not because of intelligence, but lack of motivation to complete things such as homework or projects. I failed quite a few classes and ended up having to take a second senior year. Since my daughter was born and I now have a house to clean and all other kinds of mommy duties, I really found myself struggling. It was to the point of a failing relationship and disappointment to my family and my significant other. I was unable to just focus on a task and complete it. But today, I did everything I needed to do and then some and I feel great. Very pleased so far.",9,39
Vyvanse,"I have been able to focus so much more, I feel like my life is back in order. I'm able to do things that I would struggle with in the past. Some of the feelings in my body are numb when I do the activities, which is different. All my anxiety is gone. I don't feel hungry often, and I randomly crash for sleep. This is only the second day on it, so I'll see what happens next.",10,16
Vyvanse,"My 6 yr old son has been on 20mg of Vyvanse for the past month and a half. I was so reluctant to start him on any type of medicine, but his inability to focus, keep his hands to himself, stay in his seat at school, etc., was affecting the learning of his classmates and causing him to have a hard time making friends. I saw a difference in him (and his teacher did, too), immediately after the 1st dose, he was able to focus, was making friends, etc. I have decided to try him on something different because he's losing weight and he's not the happy, sweet boy that I know he is. He's moody, he gets upset extremely easily, he's grumpy, and is SUPER serious about everything, he finds nothing funny. Its definitely altered his personality, even off the meds.",6,68
Vyvanse,"Much better than Adderall that I've been taking for 12 years. My heart doesn't race, the dry mouth effects aren't nearly as intense. There are no more highs &amp; lows! Love it.",10,24
Vyvanse,"I am a 59 year old man. I have taken Adderall 30 mg. 3x daily for about 4 years. I am very happy with its performance; it has changed my life. It's hard for me to imagine all those years of struggling I went through before I was properly diagnosed. I tried Vyvanse 70 mg. for one week. Although it worked in a fashion similar to Adderall, I feel as if I have better control taking the medicine 3 x a day. The Vyvanse would wear off and then come back and start to work again and I found it disconcerting; it was like a roller coaster. With Adderall, I can expect it will begin to wear off after 4-5 hours and I simply take another one, usually before it has lost its effectiveness, and I feel the same all day.",7,22
Vyvanse,"I am so happy with vyvanse . It has made my life so good, I listen better, I can focus on tasks. I feel even more upbeat about life no serious worrying and has slowed me down to see life better, I am so blessed for this new medicine.",9,28
Vyvanse,I'm currently in college and from only a year being on this medicine I have seen a noticeable difference in my ability to focus. My grades have gone from almost all C's to almost all A's. Highly recommended!,9,24
Vyvanse,"I was just diagnosed ADD by the Quotient test - I have always been successful but lazy and the kind of guy who always did the bare minimum but managed to squeak through life (school and work).  Fortunately I am an entrepreneur and have employees because I do not feel I could have ever held down a job. I have been taking Vyvanse for a week and my entire life has changed - I am getting my work done, I am happier, have less stress and anxiety about not getting things done and for the first time in my life I am able to sit and accomplish a task without getting frustrated, distracted and putting things off.  AMAZING!",10,31
Vyvanse,"Diagnosed with ADHD at age 8, I have tried Strattera, Concerta, Adderall, &amp; Ritalin (all had a zombie effect to no effect). It wasn't until mid 8th grade that I was prescribed Vyvanse. A miracle as far as my school performance, grades went from C's &amp; D's to straight A's. Not only did I actually WANT to take it, Vyvanse compelled me to ace my schoolwork, resulting in consistent grades of 95  (the only downside being that it induced OCD behavior.) However, while I started at 40mg, I steadily increased to 70mg (max dose) by the end of 10th grade. I have since graduated high school, but due to the tolerance I built up to the medicine it no longer affects me nearly as well as it did before. Though I still recommend it to anyone with ADHD.",9,33
Vyvanse,Changed my life. (I am a 26 year old female),10,16
Vyvanse,Vyvanse has helped me immensely as my focus is much better and I have had no ill effects whatsoever. The loss of appetite effect has been very welcome with growing older (I am 46). I have struggled with a sedentary lifestyle and my weight kept increasing. Since taking Vyvanse I have lost 50lbs and that has helped my sleep apnea to the point that I feel much better in the morning and I am not at the same weight I was when I got married 17 years ago. I am 200 lbs 6'1 and have worked up from the initial 10Mg dosage to the max now at 70Mg. I have been on Vyvanse for about a year and a half.,10,19
Vyvanse,"My 6 yr old son just starting taking the medicine a week ago and has been over the top emotional, a lot of crying over nothing at his daycare during the day.  He started at 10mg which did nothing but makes him cry so he went to 20mg for 3 days which seemed to work for about 2 days.  Today we put him up to 30mg to see how it goes.  I'm worried about the emotional side effects and really hope that it subsides.",4,25
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse is the awesomest thing that ever happened to me 4 months ago. At first I would just stare at my teachers and try to listen to them but it would just go out the other ear. But sometimes I was just down the rabbit hole daydreaming. Also when I tried to REMEMBER stuff I would get distracted because that got too boring and moved on. But on Vyvanse I can concentrate with ease. I can REMEMBER stuff without even trying to. Nothing seems boring anymore in school but I hate it how it makes me sweat a lot like under the pits .. ALOT. For me there's a major loss of appetite like I don't eat anything once I'm on it beecause food doesn't sound, look or taste good. But I do get these random cravings.",9,33
Vyvanse,"I'm a 24 year old recovering alcoholic and drug addict, I've been misdiagnosed by many doctors, been on several medications such as lithium and prozac (which I reacted horribly too and sometimes ended up in a psych hospitals) as a result of those misdiagnosis and I was untreated for ADHD my entire life since I was first diagnosed at the age of 9. I've been on Vyvanse for over a year now under the direction of a new doctor/addiction specialist and this medication has CHANGED MY LIFE. It has made me more focused and productive, more motivated, less hyper, less anxious; it has also CURED my insomnia. This is the real me: balanced, organized, articulate, focused and productive. So happy a doctor finally got my diagnosis right.",10,59
Vyvanse,I can honestly say that Vyvanse changed my life. Was diagnosed with ADD at age of 35; my quality of life has improved dramatically with Vyvanse. I sometimes feel as if I should be a spokesperson for this as I rave about how much it has helped me.,9,38
Vyvanse,"My general physician first prescribed me Concerta (Intermediate dosage) and it seemed to make me feel depressed, anxious, and more obsessive (thought-wise anyway). I was then prescribed Adderall XR (10 mg) and found that I would feel more productive and relaxed earlier in the day upon taking it, but then the side effects really began to hit hard. I was hesitant to continue to try another stimulant because I was actually diagnosed with anxiety (by my psychiatrist) and mild depression and the stimulants seemed to heighten these symptoms. He then suggested that I try Vyvanse and he also put me on Atterax (for anxiety/allergies ---weird combination, I know) in addition to Prozac. Vyvanse has been a life-saver, mild side effects, and no crash.",9,20
Vyvanse,"Our 8 yr old son was diagnosed with ADHD in Kindergarten.  We tried everything. We left no stone unturned.   We were referred to a great  psychiatrist who listened to our concerns and advised us to start him on Vyvanse. He started in March 17.  To say it has been a miracle is an understatement.  While he is not yet a A student,  he can now work independently, is not as frustrated, his handwriting has improved.  His teachers are amazed at the turn around.  I am only writing a review because I had read all the blogs and was terrified to say the least.  This med so far has worked with only a few side effects that we are working on.ie;increased agitation when coming off of. His happiness and ability to learn is worth it",9,45
Vyvanse,"Ok, to begin with: Vyvanse has dramatically improved my life. I am a 20 year old college student and I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 19. I have always been a bright student, cheerful person and an overall hard worker but Vyvanse has improved me. I feel that it allows me to monitor and control my thoughts and actions in a way I never seemed to be able to before. Effects I experience from Vyvanse: Improved concentration, ability to focus clearly on a subject or task at hand, ability to switch focus and not obsess, improvements in grades, &amp; ability to plan/schedule/prioritize activities. In the end I feel like Vyvanse has made the dream me reality, I can finally accomplish my goals.",10,27
Vyvanse,"My experience was one of thank goodness until 17 days after. Now I am VERY irratable with little or no patience. I am seeing my doctor today for an update and will ask him to let me try (again) Dexedrine. I did not want to go off of it but I think because Vyvanse is new, well you can fill in the rest. The Dexedrine has been around for a long time and I feel it is above and beyond others with knowing what to expect all the time. Good luck to all of you. God Bless.",5,5
Vyvanse,GREAT ADHD medication. ask for financial help. they give 12 month card that takes half off the cost of Vyvanse... take as directed.,10,12
Vyvanse,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 19, and I'm now 23. I have a severe case as my psychologist &amp; therapist would say in the 1 visit I met with them. I started out on Adderall and Adderall XR, but had to stop taking it due to the side effects like mood swings and Parkinson's like shaking in my hands. So my dr changed my meds to Vyvanse. I've been taking it for 1 yr and I no longer have mood swings or shake which is awesome because I don't think someone would like a shaking dental hygienist. I like Vyvanse because it still helps me concentrate, stay organized, and remember things that are told to me, but it wears off quickly. That is my only dislike about Vyvanse.",7,16
Vyvanse,I have been a mental health counselor for 37 years and have worked with ADHD for 25 Of all the medications Vyvanse is the best. It is important to start low 20 mg and then increase based on focus concentration and mid afternoon agitation. Expect very few side effects. Slight appetite loss but manageable. Very important to take it at 7am everyday. May want to hold off on weekends unless there is need to focus for study. Consider counseling to help stay on track and educate client and family regarding the fact that ADHD is a gift of creativity and out of the box thinking.,10,85
Vyvanse,"I started taking this medicine about 2 years ago now. I am on the 40 mg dose and at first everything was great, my grades improved, I could focus in public. But now, my loss of appetite is crazy. I'm 13 and I only weigh 82 lbs. I become very short tempered with my friends and I get annoyed at the littlest things. It also brings my mood way down. When I'm on my medicine I feel depressed and anxious constantly. I still get my a's and b's in school but I don't think it's worth all the side affects.",4,21
Vyvanse,My son is 9 yrs old and has been on Vyvanse for about 2 yrs or so and I have to say that its been a miracle medicine. I believe I finally got my baby boy back he also takes Intuniv as a booster pill....but my only problem is that he has chronic insomnia and no over the counter or prescribed medicine seem to make him fall asleep and stay asleep.,8,17
Vyvanse,"I am 20 years old and have been taking 60mg Vyvanse for a little more than 4 years now and It really helps me focus. It increases my attention span, clarity, and motivation without giving me jitters. However, I have experienced almost every side effect that comes with this medicine including insomnia, appetite loss, night time depression, flat-lined emotions throughout the day, ect. However, despite what you might think, there are ways around these bad side effects. Staying healthy is KEY. Making sure your keeping yourself hydrated and getting a good hour of exercise everyday can greatly reduce some of these bad side effects, and also hanging out with friends regularly helps too. This is just my experience though.",7,38
Vyvanse,Works great for me.,10,10
Vyvanse,"My son started Vyvanse two weeks ago and the difference is incredible. He has never had behavioral issues and only suffers from ADD. He just couldn't concentrate or stay on task. Reading was a nightmare and he was barely managing to pass. We were scared of trying any medicines but are so glad that we did. He did experience a few side effects such as headaches and nausea the first few days, but those have passed. Most important, he is still my son, no zombies. Homework is easy and his teacher already reports better grades. I encourage any parent to at least try this medicine. It has improved our quality of life even. We have more time for fun stuff and I don't have to nag him constantly to do his normal chores. They get done the first time.",9,38
Vyvanse,"I'm a 22 year old male with a horrible case of ADHD. In the past I've taken Adderall which made me absolutely nuts. Since starting Vyvanse I have noticed the euphoric high feeling is gone and the focused, mellow feeling kicking in. I take 70mg daily and it lasts me a solid 10 hours. Wish I had been on this medicine from the start!",9,13
Vyvanse,"I'm a 22 year old female who was diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive subtype following my freshman yr of college.  I've been taking Vyvanse for 3 yrs now (initially 30 mg, now 50 mg) and finally feel like I'm living up to my potential. For the first time ever, I am able to stay organized, complete tasks and actually show up on time!  My only complaints are lack of appetite throughout day (ravenous at night) and the desire for a cigarette for the first 2 hrs after it kicks in (never crave one when I'm not taking Vyvanse).",9,14
Vyvanse,"I am an 18 years old and I have been taking this medication since I was 14. It helps me alot with concentration in fact without it I don't know how I would have graduated high school. While taking Vvyanse I have experienced all of its side effects which includes low and high blood presure, nervousness, uncontrolable body movemnets, numbness of my left side of the body etc., mostly because some days I would take it and then didn't take it for like a week so your body would have to get used to it all over again. I just recently had a baby and now am back on it again since I plan on going to College.",9,8
Vyvanse,"My 6 yo son was only on this 10 days before yanking him off of it. The first day he ate almost nothing, threw up by 5pm and was awake at least 3 hours after putting him to bed. That day and the next few days he talked incessantly and had dry mouth, but his ability to attend in school was a little better but only for maybe 4 hours tops. By the last 3 days, it was making him worse. He was very irritable and was literally bouncing off the walls, and made his impulsiveness even worse. He was crawling on the floor, biting his nails wildly, licking things...you name it. This was a kid that most other people never even knew had issues, but within a week on Vyvanse, he was definitely acting wild.",1,24
Vyvanse,"I have been on Vyvanse for over a year, started at 20mg then 30,40,50 and decided 40mg was perfect for me. I am a college student and have always had undiagnosed ADHD. MY grades in high school were mostly C's and B's. After being on Vyvanse my grades went up. It was weird because I felt more over-stimulated Adderall type buzz/high feeling at 20 and 30mgs. I liked that feeling but I was having side effects like lack of sleep. I actually then upped my dose to 50mgs. Around that time I was holding 2 jobs and studying full time, 6 college classes. The 40 and 50mg actually made me feel more normal as if I wasn't taking anything except my mind was focused. I lacked side effects and everything was perfect. My grades are now 3.5GPA thanks to Vyvanse.",9,19
Vyvanse,"I've been taking Vyvanse for about 2 years. It DOES help me concentrate in school, but the concentration comes at a cost. I feel zombie-fied and extremely anxious, even jittery at times but I don't feel hyper. Vyvanse also makes me feel really cold all the time.",3,13
Vyvanse,"My 6 year old son was diagnosed with ADHD and started on Vyvanse 4 weeks ago. He has made HUGE strides in school.  His teachers and I are all very impressed with what this medication has done for him academically.  However, he has become an emotional wreck.  If he isn't on auto-pilot or mentally checked out, he is snapping and yelling at people at the drop of a hat.  He zones out, acts and appears to be high .. a shell of him himself.  It breaks my heart to see my fun loving, humorous vibrant little boy become a drone so that he can be successful at school.  He is on the lowest dose of 20mg.",6,32
Vyvanse,I have been taking Vyvanse for 3 months now I felt really good on the 30mg but it wasnt lasting all day so my Dr changed me to 40mg last month but I'm no longer able to take it due to the stomach aches and nausea I would get everyday. I'm now back on the 30mg and feeling great.,10,10
Vyvanse,"Vyvance is the 4th medicine we've tried for our 7 year old son's ADHD.  He has been on Vyvance for close to a month now.  With Vyvance, he still has a personality, it has a more natural, gradual start and end so he seems more balanced overall.  With other medications, he would suddenly switch back to wild and impulsive as if you flipped a switch.  The negative is that his appetite is definitely low.  He has no interest in food during the day but gets hungry late at night.  He is not falling asleep well at all, still awake after 2 hours of lying in bed.  This is definitely due to the medication. He would always fall asleep within about 15 minutes.  We've yet to find the right one, but this is definitely the best so far.",9,21
Vyvanse,"This medication should be the #1 choice that doctors prescribe their patients. I have taken Concerta, Ritalin, Adderall XR, but none seem to work as well as Vyvanse, and with as little side effects. Your confidence, mood and energy may dramatically increase with Vyvanse, it truly is a magnificent medication.",10,20
Vyvanse,My son has been on this medication since September. I have taken him off. I didn't even recognize him his emotions were so high and the anger and aggression was unbelievable!,1,24
Vyvanse,I am 20 years old and have been on Vyvanse 50mg for about 4 months now. I find this medication has helped me a lot. I've tried others but nothing can compare to this. I never finished high school but since I started taking Vyvanse I have switched my life around. I started school and am making high marks. This medication has changed my life for the better.,10,10
Vyvanse,"I am 20 years old and just started taking this medication because I was having trouble in school wrapping my head around the massive amount of data we have to learn at school. I have noticed a HUGE improvement on my comprehension while reading in my book, and much more interested and focused on everything my instructor says during the period of class time, and I actually remember it. It helps me complete my projects in school and stay focused on one task instead of walking around aimlessly wasting time seeing what everyone else is doing and saying I can just do that tomorrow, or later on. I can finally sit down and get things done the way I should be. No crashing at the end of the day, or jitteriness.",10,14
Vyvanse,"I first took Vyvanse about a year ago, was up to 50mg a day. I found it extremely helpful, but by late afternoon I was angry at everything and everyone. I decided to stop. I then tried a few other medicines (Strattera and Concerta). Strattera didn't really work as well as a stimulant and had very negative effects on my sex life, and Concerta didn't really work at all. I was ready to give up, but decided to give Vyvanse another try. This time I lowered the does to 30mg, and only took it during the work week. WOW - it made a huge difference. I'm not seeing the same side effects that I did first time. So it is clear to me that I was over medicating. Anyways, just thought I would share.",8,39
Vyvanse,"I am a 17 year old high school student. I am very active, I play football, wrestle, and run track. I had always known that I wasn't stupid or anything, but I just didn't feel like applying myself. I started taking Vyvanse after the first marking period of grading my JR. I had 2 E's, 1 D-, 1 C, 1B  and 1A- (weight Lifting). So finally my mother took me to go get checked out and I was indeed ADHD. The first day I took it, I felt like I was on top of the world. I had turned in almost ALL makeup work, like I had to be doing something productive at all times. My next Grading Period Grades were all A's. My whole football team and wrestling team could not believe it. I felt so good about myself, I am on 70 mg because I burn a lot off.",10,13
Vyvanse,"I have been taking this medicine for over two years now and when I first started taking it it turned my life around.  I'm a senior in high school now and a high honors student and I credit my success mostly to the medication. After taking the 70mg dose for a long amount of time I have noticed that the benefits of the pill have decreased.  Now, the medicine wears off within five hours of taking it.  Compared to before when it would last all day.  I do not feel as focused as I used to while taking it, I do not feel the loss of appetite anymore, and I am becoming more forgetful.",9,8
Vyvanse,"Me and my wife tried to remain in denial about our son needing medication, but it got to the point where it was interfering with his education and we had to come to terms that he may need some help. We did the research and Vyvanse was the most reliable one we could find. Its great, my sons teacher actually uses his work as examples of how the work should be done, he is extremely confident in his work, and is always happy. The only thing that we don't like is that for the first 4 hrs he doesn't want to eat, then he'll go back to eating normal. Highly recommended.",0,23
Vyvanse,"My 11 year old daughter started Vyvanse 5 months ago when she was diagnosed with ADHD.  Her doctor keeps increasing her dosage-we've gone from 20 to 40 mg, but I am not really seeing a difference. Her appetite has dropped, but we find that feeding her well in the mornings and evenings has helped.  She is having problems with friends at school and we have noticed that she is incredibly bossy. She has been argumentative with everyone around her lately..",7,12
Vyvanse,"I'm 19 and had taken Concerta successfully since I was 14, but being in college I needed a medication that would last for longer than Concerta did. My symptoms have never been very bad, but definitely affected my work. My psychiatrist suggested Vyvanse, but it was hell. It worked about the same as Concerta, but it would wear off after about 6 hours, and I would collapse on the floor sobbing. Every night I would become extremely suicidal and angry, and after just a two weeks my relationships with everyone was at a breaking point. I went back to Concerta, and now take a small dose of Ritalin when it wears off. So much better.",3,11
Vyvanse,"I am a 17 year old female who was diagnosed with ADD about 9 months ago. I had mainly B and C grades, I was scatter-brained, easily distracted, and extremely messy. Since I started Vyvanse at 30mg, I have bumped up to 40mg and I have no complaints. I have all A and B grades, I can focus on my school work, and get things accomplished in a reasonable amount of time. Only critisicm I have is the fact that is caused me to go from messy to borderline OCD. However, I like cleaning and I see it as a plus side to the medication. As is usual for ADD and ADHD medicines, I experience easy mood swings and sudden out bursts of anger, loss of appetite, and lack of sleep. However, overall I am extremely pleased as a high schooler who was struggling.",8,9
Vyvanse,As an adult I love the fact that I don't have to plan my day around when I was going to take my next dose.  With Vyvanse I take it in the morning and it lasts all day.  When my 7 year old began taking medication during kindergarten it worked well but in first grade you are there all day.  He was going to need second dose for an afternoon boost. Now that he is on Vyvanse I don't have to worry about making sure he is given his second dose by the school nurse.  He just takes on in the morning and it lasts all day. I am also impressed by how the medicine eases into you system. There are no ups and downs.,10,10
Vyvanse,Last year my oldest daughter who is now 9yrs old was diagnosed with ADD and the doctor put her on Aderrall but within a week took her off and right away put her on Vyvanse 30mg. It worked perfect for a while but now have to get her dosage raised because it wears off after only a few hours although the upside is that her grades have improved tremendously and now I also have an 8 yr old who was also diagnosed with ADHD and is also taking Vyvanse 30 mg and I've noticed a real positive change in her concentration and her mood. I love it because she is also doing so much better in school.,10,12
Vyvanse,"I am a 22-year-old female who was only diagnosed with ADHD when I was 20.  Although it was a known problem throughout my entire life, I had never been diagnosed since I was able to maintain A's and B's throughout my schooling.  Upon arriving to college though, I went from being a rockstar student to crashing and burning my first semester.  After struggling with the idea of taking a stimulant and avoiding medication, I finally caved and tried Vyvanse.  I'm very glad I made the decision because it really helps me direct my thoughts and focus and therefore has reduced a great deal of anxiety that I was experiencing from the frustration of not getting my life together.",8,6
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse changed my son's behavior even the first day, and he has taken Vyvanse daily for 2.5 years.  He was six when he started.  I also started taking Vyvanse, and just wish this had been around when I was a student.",10,8
Vyvanse,Today was my first day taking Vyvanse and wow! I usually have a sad down feeling and don't want to talk to anyone. I am a 26 year old college student. But today I actually made two new friends from class and went to lunch with them. I feel like I can walk in a room with confidence now. The only bad thing is I did have a mild headache around 9 pm. After it wore off and it only lasted around 8 hours with a dry mouth I am on the 60 mg dose. The other great thing is I actually felt like being in class today and took 7 pages of notes and sat in the very front of the class and wasn't afraid to ask questions! I'm happy to have found Vyvanse and paying attention is so much easier now. Highly recommended for people with ADD.,9,11
Vyvanse,"It works, very well in fact, but I am getting really annoying side effects. Dry mouth, stomach pains, on the first day I take it, after it completely gets out of my system, I usually get headaches. I also barely eat, instead of eating about 3 steaks, I can only eat half a steak. Most peoples' side effects aren't as bad as mine, though.",6,9
Vyvanse,"I think it might be just as good as Adderall. I can't tell fully yet as I haven't totally adjusted to it. I do feel clear headed, focused and content.",9,1
Vyvanse,"I am a 42 year old male recently diagnosed with adult ADHD.  I started on Dexedrine but I had to pop a bunch of pills 4 times a day which was not convenient. My doctor recommended Vyvanse saying its the same thing but one a day.  I am currently on 100 mg of Vyvanse combined with 300mg of Wellbrutin and am definitely more alert and able to focus more during the workday. However I have severe bouts of nausea, loss of appetite and weight (not unwelcome).  The medicine wears off by the evening so insomnia is not an issue.  I don't like price of the drug (even after my drug plan) and after discussing with my doctor I was asked to pop a 60 mg pill in the morning and a 40 mg a couple of hours later.  I will see if that helps my nausea.",0,11
Vyvanse,"I am 21 and currently suffering from ADD and Depression. The Vyvanse has done wonders for me! I can finally concentrate. I do feel as though I have absolutely NO appetite, but it doesn't bother me because I don't eat much anyway. Things are finally looking up. I'm on 20mg.",10,7
Vyvanse,"I feel like the character in the movie Limitless because I have been responding extremely well with this medicine!  It is known that medicine works different for everyone, but for me it's a God send and I only take 20 mg. I have always had a tough time comprehending everything even talking.  I have to focus on what I'm saying to make less grammar mistakes and sometimes I do sound slow. Vyvanse has enhanced my comprehension: I can now do math quicker, enjoy reading and listening, and actually talk like a normal person. I feel happy and energetic.  Sounds too good to be true, but I consider myself lucky. No adverse side effects yet.",10,28
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse changed my life for the better. I've been taking it for almost 2 years now and I honestly don't know where my life would be headed or where I'd end up without it, but looking at the direction it was going in before I got diagnosed with ADD, I wouldn't have gone far and probably ended up as a loser. I can finally read a book and know what I read or do my homework on my own! Since this medication; I stopped making stupid choices, went from D's to all B's. It helped my depression and it changed my life dramatically. My relationship with my friends and family has grown stronger. Before Vyvanse I pictured my future as a druggy, now I have a job and I am looking forward to becoming a vet.",10,26
Vyvanse,"I'm a 46 y.o. female and have been taking Vyvanse for approximately 3 months. I started out on 50mg in the morning and it worked great by giving me energy and completing projects. However, I would get tired after 8 hours. After 1 month of taking 50mg x1 a day my doctor switched me to 30mg twice daily to prevent that tired feeling after 8 hours. After 2 months of taking 30mg x2 a day I'm tired a lot and seemed to have already built up a resistance to it. Maybe I just need to increase the dose, not sure. This medicine worked great at first for ADHD and I'm hoping I can increase the dose and feel energetic and focused again. The side effects I have experienced are, weight loss (13lbs) the first month but gained 8 lbs back, and have bad breath.",7,8
Vyvanse,"My daughter is 8 years old and have been taking medicines since she was almost 4. She has been on a lot of different medicines. I am just wondering if her sudden outburst of happy, sad violent behavior is due to the doctors increasing her Vyvanse from 20mg to start with 1 year ago to 70mg which is what she is taking today.",3,8
Vyvanse,"From the day I started taking Vyvanse 2 months ago, I have become less impulsive, more organized, am completing past undone projects, can follow a difficult discussion longer without irritation, watch TV less, decisions are easier, and I've lost 20 pounds moving from 210 pounds to 190 with less compulsion to eat.  Food has lost some of its interruptive attraction.  I sleep my 7-8 hours and go all day instead of working mornings with lots of coffee and slumping in the afternoon.",10,11
Vyvanse,"My daughter just turned 7 years old and we started her on Vyvanse about 2 months ago as she was diagnosed with ADHD. After two months (this week) I called the doctor and stopped the medication as she has lost so much weight from not eating, and was sleeping ALL THE TIME! My daughter never took naps and would wake up at 6:30 a.m. religiously every morning on her own, but after we started her on the medicine, she falls asleep standing up and cannot wake her up in the mornings. We fight just to get her to eat things she likes and to no prevail. I know it might not be the medicine for her and in fact I am going to try a Non-Stimulant ADHD medication before we stop these medicines over all.",3,7
Vyvanse,"Best ADHD medication I have taken. All the pros of Adderall without the crash or mood swings. However sometimes if I haven't taken it for a few days, when I take it again I get horrible migraines at night.",9,4
Vyvanse,"My 6 yr old son started on an ADHD regimen about 8 months ago.  We started on Concerta, increased dosage 3 different times, and switched to Vyvanase.  We have increased it to 30 mg and it still is not working.  However, now the moodiness, extreme sadness, and impulsiveness is much worse while on Vyvanse.  I really am considering just dealing with the ADHD without medicinal help.  I feel sorry for the little guy.  This is not what I want him to be like.",2,29
Vyvanse,I am a 32 year old. I have been on Vyvanse for about 2 weeks now and I love it. I have never been diagnosed with ADD and about 2 months ago I was given Straterra first. I hated that. My Doctor switched me to 30mg Vyvanse and the first day I noticed a difference. It lasted me about 10-12 hrs. My appetite went down a little but nothing to bad. Other than that there are no other side effects for me. I would definitely recommend Vyvanse.,8,11
Vyvanse,"I am 18 years old and just graduated high school, all of my life I have had issues with going to school and getting things done. Always had great grades the first months of the school year then they would drop to C's, D's or failing. I was put on Vyvanse 1 day before my 18th birthday and it completely changed my life. Not only am I a much happier person, but I actually take interest in things and like finishing things I start! I have noticed some weight loss, but my appetite is and always will be still there. I'd really love to thank whoever discovered the wonderful prescription Vyvanse!",10,12
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse has been wonderful for me. I take it along with the anti-depressant Lexapro and the two medications work wonderfully together. I am a full time college student. I have been taking Vyvanse for about 8 months and I don't know what I would do without it now. I am focused and my mind is not racing a million miles an hour. I did about a year of school without it and I was an A, B, C student, but now I am mostly making A's with the occasional B.",10,11
Vyvanse,"It would be nice if everyone put the dosage in the message.   There could be a correlation to the score and the age of the child.  I have noticed age is usually there but if you were to list dosage, age, and sex - it would be great.",7,19
Vyvanse,"This medicine has changed my life.  I am a 43 year old female, diagnosed as an adult with ADHD.  I always knew I was meant for more than what I seemed capable of achieving - although I would by no means consider myself an underachiever. The statement you don't know what you don't know rings so true for me.  Immediately upon starting this prescription my world changed.  I was able to fully complete tasks, stay on schedule, CONCENTRATE, and prioritize...the list goes on and on.  I wish I had a before and after photo of my home.  The clutter, disorganization, and chaos is gone.  My house very much symbolizes my brain.  I feel like my mind has been freed from the fog, and I am able to accomplish so much more now with much less stress.",10,43
Vyvanse,"I am a 25 yr old woman, I've been on Vyvanse for about 1.5-2 yrs and I have had a great experience with it. I've always been a bright student and done pretty well in school, I got by in high school but found myself struggling in college. I got diagnosed with ADHD, tried Strattera, tried Concerta to no effect. New doctor suggested Vyvanse, I started at a 30 mg, I'm up to 70 mg a day but have been steady on that dose for at least a year. It has decreased my appetite, but I also started p90x not long after I started taking this drug so I'm not sure which is more responsible for my weight loss. Besides that, no real side effects just helps me focus and concentrate on whatever I am supposed to be doing (and not just daydream).",9,9
Vyvanse,"After being diagnosed with ADHD when I was eleven and being on Adderall XR for nine years I have to say Vyvanse is the best thing that has happened to me. The last year in college Adderall made me anxious, suspicious, and generally unhappy. So after several trials with Ritalin and Cymbalta, I am proud to say that I am doing much better on Vyvanse and my grades were awesome this semester. Two A's, two B's and a C! Much better than two B's and three C's.  I am on 40mg of Vyvanse. I did lose 20lbs during the first two months but I gained it back. I also do have some trouble eating in the afternoons but when the medicine wears off, which I never notice haha, I am able to eat quite a bit of food. Overall, Vyvanse is an amazing choice.",9,3
Vyvanse,"My son was diagnosed with ADHD when he was in the first grade.  At the advice of his then doctor we did not treat him with any medications.  My son is the sweetest, kindest kid and wanted to please everyone (teachers, parents, etc).  However, he struggled so much with academics and general life organization.  Homework time was a nightmare. By the time he was in 4th grade I broke down and took him to a doctor to try medications because something HAD to change. Vyvance has changed his life for the better. All of his grades went up in a matter of weeks, his homework is completed correctly and neatly before I even get home, and he will even tell you he feels better in general.  He also tried Adderrall but that just made him very hostile.",9,19
Vyvanse,"I have tried every AD(H)D pill known so far. I started in grade 4 and went off them in grade 7. I am weird as far as medicine goes and it never worked as intended, side effects for other pills were things such as no free will, not remembering anything that I did for 3 years, no control of self awareness or recollection of my actions, fainting or passing out without warning. I went off the pills in grade 7 due to mental and physical health issues and concerns. Decided to take the pills again because I need them to graduate, started on Vyvasne. It is 1000X times better than any other pill that I have tried over the years. Biggest problems is lack of appetite (went 26 hours without eating without realizing it) started on 80MG by mistake.",9,6
Vyvanse,"We couldn't be more pleased with this medication.  My 9 year old son was previously on Concerta and Metadate CD.  Although those medications were effective, Vyvanse has greatly out performed both.  The most significant side effect has been lack of appetite.  We encourage a late meal so that he can make up for what he has missed throughout the day.  His weight seems to be holding steady following an initial weight loss of 6 pounds.  This is a medication worth trying!",10,5
Vyvanse,"My son is 13 and has been on several ADHD medications.  I liked the Vyvance at first because I did see an improvement in his ability to sit and listen and pay attention, however it didn't last long enough.  The doctor has increased the dosage several time and now he is up to 60mg daily. The problem is that he has lost over 20lbs because he simply won't eat and now it seems after four months on this medicine its like his body has adapted to it and he is super hyper.  I spoke to the doctor about it and he said he can do real damage at his age with the weight loss and not eating and that the stimulant is actually wiring him up.  We are going to take him off of the Vyvanse and put him on a non stimulant medication.",5,4
Vyvanse,Im a 19 year old male. I struggled through school my whole life but still tested past most my classmates. I was diagnosed with ADHD last year and was on a different medication that really didn't work and then a month ago my doctor prescribed Vyvanse and it has changed my life so much. I recommend that every person with  ADHD try it out. Its amazing. The only real side effect I have is I'm a little more irritable.,9,3
Vyvanse,"I was diagnosed with ADHD in the middle of my 9th grade year. My parents noticed I have failed more classes than passed the past years. It turns out I have ADHD, I was started off on 50mg which automatically kept me calm, quiet and eager to pay attention and learn. I passed all my classes my 9th grade year. Currently, I'm almost complete with 10th grade. I am passing everything and doing an excellent job keeping up with school, homework and my job. I've gone from 50mg to 70mg. I didn't think I could feel the need to take this so much. When I don't take it, I can't hold my eyes open. I binge eat in bed, half asleep. But this does keep your mind off hunger, I went from 190lbs to 125lbs in a year.",10,11
Vyvanse,"My son was on Vyvanse for 3 years. At first the side effects were the normal irritability, obsessive thoughts and anxiety only on the days he took the drug. His concentration and grades improved so the benefits outweighed the side effects. The last year though he was increasingly negative, obsessing over negative thoughts, anxious and paranoid only on the days he took it. I think the side effects can affect kids more or less as they grow. He was very depressed for a 10 year old. Since he's been off he's been happier!! I think positive thoughts are more important than grades since we all know where negative thoughts leads to down the road if left unchecked. Overall the medicine is not bad but keep a close eye on behavior.",5,17
Vyvanse,"I am 24 years old (female). I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 11. Over the years, I tried Adderall, Concerta, and Straterra none of them really worked all that great. But I spent 8 years on Ritalin. When I was a 20, I was taking 60 mg of Ritalin a day, and was failing all my classes. My doctor switched me to 70 mg of Vyvanse (started out at 70mg since I had been on a high dose of Ritalin for so long), and it was like magic!  I started getting all A's and became more productive at work. The only bad things about the medicine are some of the side effects. I've noticed that gum helps with the dry mouth compared to just drinking water. Suffer from anxiety and insomnia now but take Celexa for anxiety and Ambien for insomnia. But all is good.",9,4
Vyvanse,"It helps a lot with paying attention, On 30mg once a day and it works up until about 7th-8th hour (5 hours after taking it) and for me suppresses my appetite so I don't care if I eat or not. Stomach still rumbles though. No other ill effects. I would recommend it. No jitteriness as with other stimulants such as Ritalin/Focalin. I feel much more like myself then on other medicines.",9,7
Vyvanse,This medication has changed my life. I've always tested very well but never was able to do mundane tasks. My teachers were always mad that I got Fs but made perfect scores on state tests since I was a kid. I was diagnosed ADHD last year. Concerta didn't work unless I soaked it in hot water and bit it in half. Adderall made me a complete genius and all I did was study and read. But I guess I was really mean to people and I got anger problems and paranoia. Vyvanse makes me feel like I'm on top of everything and that I can do something with my life. I care about my future and I haven't cut myself in over a year. It has helped with my depression that was caused by the ADHD.,0,25
Vyvanse,"I am 21 yrs old and work and am a full time nursing student. This medication has affected my personality. I am usually a bright bubbly person and don't take anything too personal. After a week of this medicine (40 mg) I noticed I'm snapping at people over absolutely nothing. I feel like I've become bipolar, one moment I'll  be beyond happy and focused, the next irritated, then angry. Then crying over nothing. I've become mouthy to my instructors and don't like long conversations anymore. People seem to irritate me and there's only a few that I can stand being around for a long period of time. I've already made mean remarks to some of my fellow students, which isn't me at ALL. Maybe this medication isn't for everyone.",2,29
Vyvanse,"I'm 16 yr old female and was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 6. I was on Ritalin, then something else, then Concerta and it was hard. I had major depression, lack of sleep, lack of appetite and the ability to feel any emotion was gone. Yes I'm an A student but I was not happy, so I tried Vyvance. It doesn't last as long but I am happier. I can feel emotion now and I'm still getting A's and B's.",7,6
Vyvanse,"I was having my son tested for ADD and the doctor ended up suggesting I get tested also. I am a 39 yr old male. I always new I was capable of more, I always felt fairly intelligent. I always had issues recalling details of projects and a roller coaster ride of motivation. I would wait until I have the pressure of the timeline closing before acting. I have become a dynamo at work and home. Instead of thinking about 100 different details of multiple projects all at once, I am able to focus on one at a time, but I have to stay organized because I can see details of something and I can't help but work on it because I get excited I can see everything so clearly. I get dry mouth and have trouble winding down at night. Can't stop working.",8,12
Vyvanse,"I've started taking Vyvanse about a year ago and for the first six months it was fantastic, I could concentrate and my grades were stellar. I was noticing some depression and random bouts of anger, but I just shrugged it off because it had been a rough school year. However, around September 2010 I ran out and the doctor couldn't see me until december (I know, it's crazy). Of course, I couldn't concentrate as well but my mood improved considerably, I was actually happy. I started taking it again in January and on the second day, I saw an ex-girlfriend that I still really liked and I almost broke down in tears. The drug does it's job, but for my personal experience it has played with my emotions.",7,13
Vyvanse,"I'm 16 and I've taken Vyvanse for months now and it helps a lot with minimal side effects. My mouth does get dry and I become less social but other than that its preferable to Ritalin, as Ritalin is much less smooth in terms of kicking in and wearing off and lasts a lot shorter.",10,1
Vyvanse,"I'm a 24 year old female who was diagnosed with ADD last July. I've been on Ritalin, Adderall and now Vyvanse. I started off on Vyvanse 30 mg about a month ago. It didn't do a thing for me. My doctor upped my dosage to 50 mg a little over a week ago. Since then things haven't been too pretty. My mind is clear, which is great but I'm completely unmotivated to do anything. I don't want to clean. I don't want to leave my house. I don't want to do anything. I feel exhausted. I guess it's like a zombie like state that I wouldn't mind if I didn't have a child and a house to care for. I'm hoping my doctor will switch me to Adderall XR. I've always lacked energy and this definitely isn't helping.",3,8
Vyvanse,"Wish my parents would have figured this out for me when I was in School. I found out Vyvanse really helps me with my attention problems (focusing mainly). I have been taking Vyvanse for 1 year now and I'm 43. My daughter who has had attention with focusing since 2nd grade struggled all the way through high school with no medicine to help. She started college 1 year ago (when we both started taking Vyvanse) and she now is enjoying college with excellent grades even winning awards for student of the quarter and being selected for some honor club! Oh by the way in high school she was making c,d and f's and dropped out her senior year but did get her GED. She says she never new she was smart but now realizes she just couldn't pay attention.",8,14
Vyvanse,"My 7 year old son was recently diagnosed as ADHD and I was really hesitant to put him on medicines but when I took him to the doctor she said yes no doubt he had ADHD so they put him on Vyvanse at 30 mg. The first day and I was ready to cry myself. It was like he had eaten a whole gallon of ice cream he could not stop talking and did not sleep the first 2 nights, but I am really happy with the outcome. He is so much better. I can hear my thoughts now so I am a believer in the medicines it worked for him.",9,13
Vyvanse,"My son is 14 and although he had signs of ADHD it was clearly obvious when he got in High school and started to struggle more than ever. I dont need to go into all his symptoms because he has so many and wish I did not wait so long to wake up and smell the coffee (if you know what I mean). Anyway I went to the Doctor and after all my research I asked the doc (I am a nurse by the way) if we could try Vyvanse and he said yes, that is after he determined that Yes he has ADHD. The first week back at school (after break) the teachers could not believe the change in him. In Algebra(before medicine) he was flunking all his tests and today he sent me a text that he got his first A. The knowledge was all there, it just needed help to be released.",10,7
Vyvanse,"My 11 year old son was diagnosed with ADHD inattentive in August 2010 and we tried Concerta 36mg and it did nothing. The pediatrician prescribed Vyvanse 40mg to start, and what a difference! My son can now listen, focus, pay attention, concentrate at home and at school and can better manage his behaviors, thoughts and words. We are very happy with the results. He didn't lose appetite or weight, and has no side effects thus far. We are more than happy to have found a prescription that works for him so that he can function normally on a day to day basis.",10,12
Vyvanse,My 7 year old son started Vyvanse about 3 weeks ago.  The first day he took a 30 mg dose which made him like a zombie all day and absolutely manic all night.  He literally stayed up all night and ran up and down the hall and talked incessantly. At the end of my rope at 7 am I paged his doctor.  We lowered the dose to 15 mg. He seemed initially to do better on the 15mg and was doing well in school.  He became more aggressive and started having OCD behaviors of constantly washing his hands (I counted 30 times in an hour) and crying and staying up all night.  Last night he stayed up until 4:30 am and I was at my wits end. So today his doctor is switching him to another medication but we may try it in a combination.,6,13
Vyvanse,I have been taking this medicine for my ADHD and in the first couple of days I have lost five pounds. I don't know if this is normal and I am trying to find that out. I also have stomach aches all day long with loss of appetite. I'll get lightheaded some times. But it does help me concentrate on what I am doing and say focused.,8,5
Vyvanse,"This medicine works extremely well. I have been very pleased with its effects and yielded results in many different areas in my life.  From greatly increased concentration to unknown sources of motivation to succeed, Vyvanse has helped me immensely. I also think that I should put this in here too.  I am eighteen and have experienced depression before.  During one such battle, I thought that a nice way to end things, would be to really overdose on my medicines. Well, turns out that you just get a really strange night's sleep and an awful stomach ache for a day with your fair share of vomiting.  Needless to say, I learned my lesson and really just told myself how stupid I was and went on with life. However, all in all, this medicine is very good.",8,7
Vyvanse,My daughter is 6 years old and was diagnosed with ADHD when she was 4. I just recently put her on medication due to the fact her grades were slipping and she was in trouble constantly at school. She is on 30mg of Vyvanse. Although she has improved 100% at school she comes down off the medication at about 5pm and is a holy terror. She gets put to bed at 8 and does not fall asleep until some time around midnight. Also she does not eat hardly anything but she has always been that way for the most part.,4,18
Vyvanse,"I've been taking Vyvanse for a couple of months and I've have learned that the first couple of weeks taking the medication is really the hardest when it comes to side effects. I suffered from dry mouth, loss of appetite, head aches, some but very few mood swings. As far as sleep, I crash at the end of the day which can be due to this medication. I am irritable every now and then, but before I was very frustrated with everyday activities. It gives me energy for the most part. I'm not shaky or nervous like I was on Adderall XR. I haven't lost a ton of weight on Vyvanse unlike Adderall which I lost 60 pounds on within 4 months.",7,10
Vyvanse,"I am 45 years old with 2 sons with ADHD.  I've always known that I also have ADHD, but it wasn't officially diagnosed until 2 months ago.  My doctor put me on an escalating dose of Vyvanse, starting at 30mg and upped to 50mg.   I am so glad I finally sought treatment and my physician prescribed this medication.  I can read something and pay attention to the words I am reading for the first time in my whole life.  I don't have to re-read and re-read until I can concentrate on the words.  My thoughts are much more organized, and I don't feel like a spinning top.  I have not experienced any negative side-effects, and I am sleeping better. I know that others have had some bad effects with this drug, but it is a miracle medicine for me.",10,22
Vyvanse,"For me, Vyvanse has the smoothest feeling of the ADHD medicines I have tried. I have found that Concerta (methylphenidate) and Focalin (dexmethylphenidate) create an anxious feeling. Vyvanse does not make me feel this way. Downside: it can be outrageously expensive.",10,18
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse had decent effectiveness and minimal side effects . It was also (pretty much) the most effective medicine for me, despite it not being all that great at relieving many of my ADHD symptoms. (I have tried Dexedrine, Concerta, Adderall XR and, of course, Vyvanse).",8,2
Vyvanse,"I have been diagnosed with ADHD and since then my life have been a total wreck. I didn't get any work done in school or focused on anything also forgetting a lot of things frequently.  I went to my psychiatrist and she prescribed me Vyvanse 30mg. The first day I took it I felt AWESOME I focused more and I was very talkative which is normal for me, anyways no change there. But since I'm 5'9 and 230lbs I need the weight loss so that's good for me. Right now I double dosed because I want this to last longer not until 12p.m.",8,5
Vyvanse,"I am 33 years old, and my son is 7 years old and we both have ADD and ADHD respectively.  His mom started him off with 20mg of Vyvanse and it seemed to help out his behavior and focus problems at school. The only thing is the poor kid is losing weight. I was curious about the side effects and wanted to see if it could help out with my focus. So I started taking Vyvanse as well. It has been okay. I like the fact that I can stay on task and not go from idea to idea and not stick to one thing, but there are major withdrawal symptoms and I tend to be a total space cadet if I don't take it.",8,11
Vyvanse,"I'm 29 and was just given Vyvanse for ADD. Always knew I had it, but was to embarrassed to actually do anything about it. After taking this medication for the last week, it was really a huge mistake to wait. It has fixed my memory, my focus, my social anxiety, can go places and don't want to leave right away. I am sure things can still turn but it has been the best week of my life that I can remember. If I can get past the side effects, dry mouth, stomach pain, little trouble sleeping (all worth it for me) I'll be good. Now I just hope it can fix my spelling soon.",8,22
Vyvanse,"I am 44 years old and was recently diagnosed as ADD.  I am a successful professional that always had to work a little harder to achieve results due to my lack of concentration and tendency toward distractions.  I started taking Vyvanse, and have to admit I felt like Superwoman for about a week and ranted and raved about how much I was getting done without the jittery feeling most stimulants provide.  But then all in one day, I crashed.  I started getting extremely agitated.  I then would get so angry I would cry hysterically.  I quit taking the medication and within a few days my mood and attitude have leveled off.  Although, I have suffered from extreme vertigo and exhaustion since I have been off this medicine. I was on 30mg.",2,36
Vyvanse,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was eleven. Over the years, I've been on Metadate, Strattera, Ritalin, Adderall, and Concerta. Finally, after a couple years of a break from the medications (nothing worked before), my new doctor decided to put me on Vyvanse (30mg).  Within the first few hours of taking this drug, I noticed improvement. My mind didn't feel clouded, I could remember things, I could finish tasks, and I was not easily distracted like before. He added Depakote(125mg) to my regimen, which is supposed to assist with agitation and anxiety. Together, these drugs have tremendously improved my life. The only bad things I have noticed is that my appetite is almost gone and I talk A LOT more than I used to.",10,27
Vyvanse,I've been on Vyvanse for about 2 months now and I've seen a huge improvement in my motivation to do thinks and want to do school work. My grades were really bad before I took Vyvanse but now they are excellent. The only downfall to this is I have lost about 20 pounds and it seems like I'm always nervous so I guess I'm going to stop this medicine so I can gain the weight back on.,7,9
Vyvanse,"I had found myself spacing out and getting very easily distracted in school. I would always talk and anything from a noise to something moving out the window would distract me and get me off task somehow. I also had trouble staying focused on assignments that took a descent amount of time to finish. I finally told my psychiatrist about it and he gave me Vyvanse 30mg. It helped me out A LOT. I stayed focused, and if I started an assignment I finished it but he gave me a script for 1 a day every morning but I found myself taking 2 a day sometimes so he gave me the 60mg Vyvanse. So now I take one 60mg Vyvanse a day and am fine. I don't get distracted anymore like I did. I find myself getting all my work done then talking instead of talking 1st.",9,15
Vyvanse,"I am a 20 year old female. I have been taking 50mg Vyvanse for about 3 months or so. I started taking it during the summer and so my schedule of taking it was rather irregular which caused me to have insomnia and decrease my appetite. I have started school now and it works wonders. I am able to concentrate in class and I have motivation to actually do my homework. I even wish I were in school longer..strange I know. I have experienced the side effects from it, more recently though. I have noticed my heart will race for no real reason, I have become more irritable and on edge (although I'm pretty sure I was like that before), and I tend to get kind of agitated at very minuscule things.",6,19
Vyvanse,"Just started taking Vyvanse. Before I was taking Adderall 30mg XR and I'll tell you Vyvanse works so much better. Vyvanse stays active until it wears off. The only bad part is, sometimes it will stop working for like 5 minutes and then it will start working wonders again. It helps me get my work done and it helps me stay in control and very focused all day long while I'm working. Before I started taking Vyvanse I couldn't concentrate what so ever. And I would never get my work done. It also makes me feel the best that I have ever felt in my whole life. If it wasn't for Vyvanse I would probably be fired. I'm 24 and I finally get to enjoy life. To the people who made Vyvanse god bless you.",10,23
Vyvanse,"I have gone through alot of medications so far and I am completely frustrated with the extended release medications. I was so happy to start my son on Vyvanse because of the advertisement stating it last for 12  hours. Not so, it last probably 5 hours, why take extended medication if you have to give an afternoon dose? He has been on up to 70 mg of Vyvanse for a year now and I am thinking of switching him to a different medication. Vyvanse does take care of his hyperactivity but, the lack of attention and defiance is still there.  Also, the medication takes 90 minutes to kick in. The doctor told me to give him a booster dose (10 mg. of Adderall) with the Vyvanse to kick in earlier, does not work.",6,13
Vyvanse,Vyvanse is amazing. I've had it for about 4 months now and it's worked better than any other medicine I've tried. I am able to focus on the stuff I am doing and am able to stick with a task. I highly recommend it.,10,8
Vyvanse,"My son (ADHD) has been on Vyvanse for about 3 years now, and I love it. He is 10 years old now. He started out on Focalin which he took for about 3 months and never seen a change in him. So his doctor switched him to Vyvanse and the very first day I noticed a change in him. Calm and relaxed, but not a zombie like I heard a lot of ADHD medicines do. He always made A's &amp; B's but since on Vyvanse he has made all A's, I believe it's due to he is able to sit still in his seat and concentrate more.  The only side effect I have seen in him is his appetite.  He does not have one and is on the skinny side.  But we found a way to get him to eat so hopefully he will gain amlittle.  Other than that this medicine its WONDERFUL.",10,29
Vyvanse,"I love Vyvanse. It helps me concentrate and helps me in school to work faster and harder. When I get home I immediately start homework and then I just chill with the family until bedtime when I'm tired. I did have insomnia but that went away within about a week. Now I sleep like a baby again and it helped me finally start working out which I have been planning to do for almost 2 months now. Also, I went from struggling to get D's to easily making A's in all classes. I recommend this medicine.",10,19
Vyvanse,"I'm 24, in gradschool and I've been taking the 70mg for about four months.  At first I lost ten pounds but now have maintained my appetite.  When I don't take it I do feel an uncontrollable desire to eat a lot.  I have difficulty sleeping at night and sometimes won't fall asleep until 3 or 4 am, and I take the medicine as soon as I wake up. I think it works best a few hours after taking it. Feel no anxiety and accomplish a lot- but then wears off by the afternoon.  Also I was prescribed an anti-depressant before but I feel this somewhat takes care of that. I still prefer taking Vyvanse now but I do think I'll stop for a while after graduating because I'm not sure about the long term effects.",8,12
Vyvanse,"My son is almost 7 years old and has ADHD.  His Doctor put him on Strattera and Metadate CD 2 years ago.  His behavior got worse and worse (Doctor even diagnosed him with ODD).  I refused to believe that my child could control his behavior and I knew this was a result of his medicines.  His Doctor kept saying no, he just needs more structure etc.  I finally DEMANDED that we take him off both medicines and try something else.  I insisted we try Vyvanse. The BEST thing I have ever done.  My son is now a sweet, happy, normal little boy who rarely gives us problems.  His appetite is back, he gets along great with other kids and we are amazed at the change in him.  I highly recommend that other parents give this medication a try for their ADHD children.",9,46
Vyvanse,"Amazing medication! My teenager has severe ADHD, and it has turned her life around! She is able to be her true self, but before her severe ADHD often overshadowed her great personality. She does have depression and anxiety but the Vyvanse does not cause that. The medicine did make her lose almost 25 pounds, and she was in 9th grade and she weighed 99 pounds. She was really small, and we almost had to take her off the medicine, but she eventually started gaining weight. She is still very small, but her weight is healthy. It does make her a bit more irritable, but it's nothing compared to the rage she had before the medicine. Vyvanse has finally been able to get rid of that ADHD, and help her think clearly, and be herself!",9,15
Vyvanse,"My son is on Vyvanse, now so am I. First, my head is clear for the first time ever. No 90 mile an hour uncontrollable though, no wondering ideas, no day dreaming. I don't feel drugged. In fact, I feel drugged when I'm not on medicines now. I didn't know what it was like to be normal prior to this medicine. The only issue I have is the stomach problems. Some slight stomach pain and bowel issues. I also stopped drinking caffeine and have adjusted my diet to be more well balanced. It's helped a lot. If you're new to Vyvanse, don't drink caffeine! Water only, and adjust your diet for high protein in the morning, it's a must.  Change your diet and quick.",10,38
Vyvanse,"This changed my life for the better! I am 35 and just got diagnosed with ADD/ADHD five days ago. I can focus and I don't feel like my brain is going 2,000 miles an hour. I remember things and can finish things I start in order. It's amazing!",9,12
Vyvanse,"I'm 49 and I've been taking Vyvanse for three years.  It does help somewhat, but it only last about five to six hours, probably less than that.  I'm taking 20mg, which I think is too low, but my provider refuses to raise the dosage.",3,12
Vyvanse,"My Son has been taking Vyvanse for about a year now 70mg but he was on other medications before this and although they helped, we had moved and the new doctor did not want to prescribe him anything but Vyvanse and after some research I actually found that Vyvanse is one of the best for ADHD. The only side effects he has had was loss of appetite and insomnia but he is taking something to help him sleep and he eats good in the morning before he takes his medicine just doesn't like eating lunch so I bribe him if he wants to go play games he must eat a snack just like an apple or something no more weight lose just a steady weight now. School has become so much easier for him with grades and the teachers see a great change in him.",9,7
Vyvanse,"I am 18, and alongside my ADD, I suffer from major depression disorder, objective defiant disorder, and major case anxiety. After an emotional breakdown on a school trip, my doctor started me back on my Zoloft and once I got that stabilized he started me on Vyvanse. We started at 40 and that worked while I was taking my Zoloft at night, but when I moved it to the morning, we had to up the dose to 60mg. I have experienced nausea, dizziness, increasing perspiration, and a little insomnia, but they don't last too long. I have also been struggling with weight pretty much my whole life. I started on May 2nd and I have lost a little over 20lbs.",8,8
Vyvanse,My 6 year old son (has autism) has switched to Vyvanse 20 mg from Ritalin. He has been on it for about 10 days now. He is calmer in the morning but very restless and irritable in the evening starting from late afternoon. I think it is a withdrawal effect. I have not seen any other side effect. Perhaps I will ask the doctor to increase the dose a bit. If there is anybody who think he/she has found the right dose please post it here.,0,13
Vyvanse,"I am a 15 year old female. I started taking Vyvanse around 5 months ago. When I first started taking it I saw a difference immediately. I was always on 50mg. It made me very irritable and emotional the first times I took it. Currently, I've been taking this for a few months and it is starting to become less effective on me. I am now starting to double up my doses taking 50mg to 100mg a day. It gets me through the day and keeps me awake. Not to mention excellent grades in school.",8,8
Vyvanse,It gets me going and keeps me focused.,0,6
Vyvanse,"I am fifteen years old and started taking Vyvanse 30 mg dose in October.  I moved to 50mg and am now at 70mg.  At the lower dose I noticed definite improvement in my attention span and work ethic.  On the 70mg I feel anxious, depressed, and I have headaches constantly.  I feel like isolating myself socially from everyone else and am extremely moody.  I do not recommend more than 50mg of this medication to anyone.",5,34
Vyvanse,I started out with 50 mg and then went to 70mg.  My blood pressure skyrocketed and I have always had low blood pressure.  My doctor took me off of this immediately.,4,11
Vyvanse,"My 7 year old son has been on Vyvanse for a little over a month.  We have been well pleased with the overall outcome.  He is now able to focus in school and actually sits down and completes his homework without argument. Much calmer in public, unlike before.  Downside, he has lost 4 pounds in a month and becomes very emotional if taken off for the weekend and put back on.  After 1 1/2 months, my son now has developed eye tics.  We have stopped the medication and the eye tics are beginning to subside.",4,34
Vyvanse,I'm 48 years old and have three children.  Two of which have ADHD.  My son is 15 and started on 40mg of Vyvanse in January.  The results have been amazing.  He used to struggle to get D's and he was always getting in trouble at school for doing dumb impulsive things.  His grades started coming up immediately and we never hear from the school about discipline problems.  He's making A's and B's after 4 months.  He's no longer forgetful and scatterbrained like before.  He is as impressed as anyone with the results and wouldn't think of going a day without it.,9,17
Vyvanse,"I am a 39 yo woman, diagnosed with ADHD, inattentive type, this past summer, about three days after my son was diagnosed ADHD.  After a consultation with a psychopharmacologist, I started taking Vyvanse about three months ago.  I also take 100 mg of Neurontin 3x daily, which keeps any anxiety issues I may have (an issue that can be magnified by the Vyvanse) at bay.  I couldn't be happier with the Vyvanse--started at 30 mg and am now at 50.   Realizing that I had ADD changed my life--suddenly, my difficulties all made sense!  The pill isn't magic--but taking it daily has given me the ability to use the tools I knew I should use and couldn't before (things like a calendar, or my checkbook register, or a budget, or a watch...).",9,42
Vyvanse,"I am 26 and started taking classes again. I was diagnosed ADD at 9 and was off and on Adderall and Ritialin through high school. I would always take it in the morning of school days, and not take it on weekends. I'm on 70 mg Vyvanse now I've been on for 3 months. I like it because it suppresses my appetite the least of the 3 medicines. I'm getting concerned though, because with school and work I will take 2 a day sometimes. But I still don't take it on non work or school days, but my concern is I think I am feeling withdrawal effects. I took it 12 days straight between 70 and 140mg a day, and the first day I didn't take it I couldn't get out of bed and felt depressed and had no motivation. I'm on day 2 and my brain feels like mush.",8,14
Vyvanse,"My daughter is 17 and has been taking vyvanse for 3 weeks. All I can say is wow  her GPA has went up 1 point!!! her main problem was taking tests...she could not concentrate at all !!! homework was ok but work at school was terrible ...now she scores 85 % and up in all her classes . Sha actually enjoys schools , her self esteem grew (she always thought she was not as smart as other kids). I dont know if thats how it will work all the time but so far it has been great ! She has some appettite loss especially during the day but it has been coming back slowly and she started to eat more normal.  She does not take the mediciane on weekends unless she studies. I dont see any other side affects besides loss of appetite.",9,24
Vyvanse,It is a good medicine. Helps in school. Although I am concerned because my son is very pettie and he doesn't have regular appetites. I read the side effects and it said that this medication can slow down growth. My son has a big issue about his height. Beside all of that he start taking Vyvanse after I took him off Adderall XR and it's a BIG difference in his attitude.,9,17
Vyvanse,"I'm a 40 yr old female and I've been on several different medicines before Vyvanse. I have now been on Vyvanse for about 6 months (100mg )and it has by far been the best. I even had my 14 yr. old son switched to it and he's doing better also. He has been on several that have worked for awhile then stopped. At first you might feel a little strange, but that goes away within a couple weeks. If you have this, I highly recommend trying this.",9,11
Vyvanse,"I'm 21 years old, and have been on Vyvanse for 5 months (40mg). Compared to other medications its more evenly released throughout the day and seems to last around 8 or 9 hours. I would definitely suggest giving it a month before you completely ban it, because it did take getting use to (like any medication). It can effect your sleep depending on the time of day you take your medication. It hasn't decreased my appetite, but in the beginning I would forget to eat- as long as you get on a routine eating schedule though you should be fine. It made me slightly irritable in the beginning, but like I said give it some time and it seems to even out.",8,15
Vyvanse,"As a 44 year old male, who recently went for treatment of this problem.  I went for almost 43 with always knowing that something was missing. Being a over achiever I made every attempt to complete everything but never really completed anything. This drug has changed that. It allows me to focus on the task that I have in front of me and complete it. Which has been a breath of fresh air for my job, my marriage and my kids.",9,325
Vyvanse,"I have a 7 year old son with ADHD. He was diagnosed at 4 years old. Through the years he has been on 3 different medications. Ritalin was first and it did help with his hyperactivity level, however he still had problems with impulsiveness. Then he was on Focalin XR and that did nothing with his impulsiveness and hyperactivity. Now he is on Vyvanse and that has helped with ADHD symptoms. The only problem that I am currently having is that he has days where he is extremely emotional. He has days where he is getting upset over minor details like coming home after playing at a friends house. I am not sure if this is drug related or ADHD related. Impulsive people have problems containing their emotions.",8,37
Vyvanse,"I am a 33 yr old male, I started taking Vyvanse yesterday and it is the first medication that I have ever taken for anything really. I was B student in school because I refused to do homework, I couldn't concentrate enough to motivate myself to do it and I suffered in college for it. Now I manage restaurants. I am happy with that choice but lately as pressures from work seemed to increase, I chose to see a psychiatrist to help me complete tasks. I am taking 50mg a day, I usually wait until noon to dose since I work until 1 am most nights. So far, so good, a little jittery but it is new to my system. Slight loss of appetite but nothing that concerns me. I am happy with my choice so far.",7,18
Vyvanse,Been on Vyvanse for three months now. I'm 6 foot 195 pounds and 20 years old but find even the 30 mg dosage to be more than enough for me. Experience occasional bouts of dizziness and when in stressful situation have some degree of chest pains. Lasts more than the full 12 hours for me. I have to wake up at 8 am in order to fall asleep around 1 AM.  Also when I take Vyvanse I notice some degree of hair loss. I feel as if my brain is telling my body to work and as a result my body is working in triple overtime to keep up.,8,13
Vyvanse,"I am 20 years old and I have ADD. I have been on every medication under the sun. I've been on the lower dose of Vyvanse for about a year and 1 week on the 40 mg.  It has turned me into a monster. Side effects, I have been temperamental, irritated, easily annoyed. Mean to people close to me for no reason. Tired of school, want to give up school, dizzy. Feel like on autopilot going through the motions not really there, don%u2019t care anymore, isolation. My eye sight has been whack since I started higher dose. Have had chest pain not often every once in a while. I am happy during the day but at night.",4,46
Vyvanse,"My son is currently 19 and was diagnosed with ADD when he was 8. He has been on many different medications with Adderall XR being the most recent. When he was in 10th grade the panic and anxiety attacks became so severe that we had to take him off Adderall. He has been taking Vyvanse (70mg)for about 2 years and really likes this medication. He does take himself off in summer for a break. Only side effect we've noticed is high blood pressure which we keep a close eye on. He likes this medicine, the best and really has helped with focus.",9,9
Vyvanse,"I been taking Vyvanse a little over 2 yrs. This is the only medicine I have taken for ADHD. As of this posting I have been off it 3 days. The first 18 months I thought Vyvanse was the best thing sense sliced bread. The last 6  mths have been an emotional roller coaster of side effects. I have spent hours on the floor crying, my social life is none, I didn't talk to anyone but the people at work that I couldn't avoid, my husband wants a divorce and nothing made me happy, I was sad and depressed all the time. Please be careful taking this medicine. I don't think it was meant for long term use or maybe it just affects different people in different ways. After 3 days in bed I'm finally getting back to normal.",5,46
Vyvanse,"I've been taking Vyvanse for about a year now and it has been an interesting trip. At first I couldn't sleep for the life of me and would go days on only a couple hours of sleep that I could get. Then after a couple months I was able to sleep almost like I used to and I noticed that I was more mentally alert and energetic but, my appetite dramatically diminished to almost nothing and still felt like my body wasn't getting enough rest. On top of that, when I would skip a dose I would have EXTREME hunger where I couldn't eat enough and I would have terrible fatigue! After a year everything evened out and began to feel normal other than having no appetite, but I have a healthy food schedule so I don't forget to eat. I would also like to say that I think it should NOT be recommended for children!",7,33
Vyvanse,"I'm a 20 year old female who started taking Vyvanse about a year ago. I take two 70s every morning and I still end up feeling exhausted around 9 every night. I'm pretty sure I'm heavily bipolar though and that my family isn't listening to me causing me to frankly, lose my mind. I end up skipping a lot of pills and that seems to help. Those days I feel comfortably idle.",7,9
Vyvanse,I am a 19 year old college student and just got prescribed Vyvanse about 2 days ago. When I take it I mainly feel relaxed and sometimes excited. I've never been on any stimulant or ADD medication before. My main concern is losing weight on this medicine. I'm about 5'9 and weigh about 135lbs. I eat a lot and I'm still fairly skinny. I've always worried about my weight and the last thing I want is to get skinnier.,9,6
Vyvanse,"I'm 21 years old and I've been on 40mg Vyvanse for about 5 months give or take.  I've been on other medications for ADHD in the past, but they left me feeling edge-y or more anxious. This medication works much better in terms of even release and feeling normal, and not jittery or like I have a come down when medication wears off. However, I still struggle trying to find the ideal medication/dosage because my days are long, sometimes from 4am until 10pm  at night, and no medication has lasted that long for me.   I used to take Adderall twice daily, so that it would last me the entire day, but that left me feeling terrible.  I fear if I up the dosage of Vyvanse to twice daily, I may start getting other side effects as well.",7,12
Vyvanse,"This is my second day on Vyvanse. I am very excited to try this drug in hopes that this one will work. I have been on Metadate and Strattera both didn't seem to help me at all. The first day I took this I did well at work. I am a server and usually mess up something but no mess-ups that day! Afterwards I cleaned my room, which I have been meaning to do forever, and I saw a movie. I did not talk once. My friends were amazed, as was I. I usually ruin movies by talking over them. I have a good feeling about Vyvanse but I will need more time to really tell if it's right for me. I did have a few outbursts though and afterwards felt silly. I'm not sure if this is a side effect of the drug.",8,10
Vyvanse,"I am a 44 year old woman who just got diagnosed with ADD. Vyvanse is the first medication prescribed to me and I have been on 50mg for about a month.  The first 2 days I was hyped up, euphoric, and extremely talkative. After that and now it has actually mellowed me out, I am in a good mood all day for the first time in 30 years (severe chronic depression). I can't believe the difference and wish I would have had something like this years ago. I might've had a better life. I can concentrate and happily socialize now. I have had zero side effects! Amazing.",9,88
Vyvanse,My 6 year old has been on Vyvanse for 3 years. There are times that I have not had any medicines to give him and the teacher says its like a whole other kid. Without him being on Vyvanse I was at the school all the time and my grades were dropping. I did not want him on medicines at first but I am so happy that I decided to. He is still my little Buge and not a hot mess. Such a joy and thanks to Vyvanse I have my son back.,8,30
Vyvanse,"I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 5 and have been on Ritalin and Adderall throughout my entire life since then.  I know long time.  I was switched to Vyvanse and this is my first day taking it and I like it so far.  I wouldn't call it a miracle drug for me because I have extreme ADHD but it is a lot smoother than Adderall XR I was taking prior.  I also feel more emotionally stable and have more confidence. I also take another 10 mg of Adderall around noon and another 20mg.  We will see how this medicine holds up to all this good stuff.  I am hoping forever since I will never be able to get off a stimulant medication.  But remember, if you have been on stimulants for awhile and do not take them, you will feel EXTREMELY tired and sleep all day.",8,15
Vyvanse,"I am a 14 year old girl and last year when in 8th grade I found out I was ADD. My doctor prescribed me Vyvanse. At first it took me a couple weeks to find out what worked for me (when to take it, eat first or after etc.). My grades at the time were horrible and they went up after I started taking Vyvanse. I have had a few of the side effects (dry mouth, loss of appetite, weight loss etc.) but this medication helps me focus a lot more.",10,21
Vyvanse,"My 8 year old son has been on this mediation for 1 year and a half. He started at 20mg now he is taking 40mg. I have noticed that it does not seem to work and after trying for 9 months to get him off and on something else I am going to take him to a different doctor. Given the fact that after 9 months it is still not working another doctor would try something different but his Doctor just keeps upping the dosage. I have also noticed side effects that disturb. It worries me because my son is usually happy go lucky all the time and with this medicine he is VERY EASILY upset, not himself at all. SO PLEASE BE AWARE OF EVERYTHING YOUR CHILD DOES OR ACTS WHILE TAKING THIS MEDICATION.",4,205
Vyvanse,"I was diagnosed three years ago with adult ADD (and I'm 46!). First was prescribed Adderall, but I found that even the slow-release capsule wore off quickly, leaving me exhausted and crashing at work, scarfing down cups of coffee. My doctor switched me by Vyvanse, and it's been much, much better. I am better able to focus, it lasts longer. However, it still doesn't get me through the whole day and I find I'm extremely tired at night. Also, sometimes I get caught up in the trivial details of both work and home projects. But on the whole, I am FAR better off since I began Vyvanse. I wish that 70mg was not the highest recommended amount, but I stick to it.",9,31
Vyvanse,"I refused ADD/ADHD medications my entire life until I was 21 years old and doctor finally convinced me to try it. After struggling academically for years and years, now as a college student I am receiving near perfect grades in every course. Before Vyvanse, I thought these medications were a joke, but I now admit that I was wrong.",9,38
Vyvanse,My 9 year old daughter has been on this for about 2 months.  We switched from Adderall XR due to severe weight loss.  This seems to work much better and also does not affect her personality like Adderall.   She has some loss of appetite but not as bad.   Yesterday I forgot to give the medication to her and she had a severe crying spell last night and did not know why.  I believe she may have been experiencing withdrawal symptoms.  She is taking 40 mg.   I may switch back to 30mg.  Be aware that you may not be able to stop this medication abruptly if on it for a long time.,7,44
Vyvanse,"I posted a couple of months ago...but wanted to post again since I've been on Vyvanse a little longer and have more to share. I'm a 40 year old woman.This medication has changed my life and I can't say enough positive things about it. My doctor and I were discussing it last night and he said that not everyone has the success that I've had on it...everyone is different. I take 70mg and it does last all day. No bad side effects except I've lost 15lbs, so I must watch that. Also..dry mouth. Otherwise, Vyvanse gets the highest marks with me. For bad PMS..I take Lithium for 7 days prior to start of period..and that keeps the meanies away. :)",9,49
Vyvanse,"I'm 29 years old and was diagnosed with ADD when I was about 11 years old. Since that time I've been on and off a variety of medications from Ritalin, Adderall, and most recently Vyvanse which I've been on for a year and am currently taking 70mg a day. It helps with my alertness and attentiveness, but I have some of the side effects like extremely dry mouth and little if any appetite. I am currently working during the day and take graduate classes at night and notice that the medication does not last the entire 12 hours, I've been taking it later in the day so that I'm able to concentrate in class. Since I began taking the medication I have seen an increase in acne, previously I had minor occasional breakouts.",6,17
Vyvanse,"My 5 yr old started taking Vyvanse today and had a bad reaction to it while at school, severe itching with a twitch of his shoulder.  There was no outside signs of breakout.  Tried to contact doctor who prescribed and have received no reply, therefore after talking to pharmacist and school nurse, and health unit care provider, I have decided to stop Vyvanse, 30mg daily, until I receive some reply from his doctor. Then I am going to ask for something else.  If it works fine for your children, God bless, but please keep an eye on them for the first 24 hours; allergic reactions do occur, we were just lucky it was not more severe.",3,30
Vyvanse,"I have been taking Vyvanse 4mg for a month and my productivity in my work and school have increased measurably. I have taken several different ADHD medicines through a period of several years, and Vyvanse is by far the most effective. It hasn't caused me any of the side effects caused by most ADHD medicines (paranoia, restlessness, agitation, lack of appetite). Of course these are just my experiences, but I would recommend Vyvanse to others.",9,18
Vyvanse,"I'm 19 and I started taking 100mg Vyvanse a day when I was 17. Before Vyvanse I took Focalin. I love Vyvanse except for the fact that it doesnt last for the full 12 hours. When I first started on it, my senior year in high school after I had my daughter. I had never felt so confident. I made high honors and was like smart for the first time. I was capable of being focused of what was only going on in the classroom and didn't have to worry about anything besides school. I just really hated when I would crash because then I would get tired and then didn't feel like really doing anything. I do notice side effects but other then that I think it's worth taking.",5,19
Vyvanse,"I was originally on Concerta for my ADD and got extremely depressed and almost suicidal. I then switched to Adderall which I took for 4 years without many problems, until I developed a tolerance to it and my dose got so high that I was getting a bunch of side effects. I tried Strattera, which I did absolutely nothing and made me really sleepy. Then I switched to Vyvanse which worked about the same as the Adderall but I wasn't as irritable and didn't have the same loss of appetite. However, I did start to develop acne, which I didn't realize until recently was being caused by the Vyvanse. I've also developed a major dependency, if I don't take it, I have trouble doing daily tasks and I'm really tired.",6,28
Vyvanse,"I have been taking this medicine for two weeks now. Most of the side effects have gone away with the exception of the lack of appetite which is not really a bad thing. My life has improved I have been taking 50 mg. I cleaned my car for the first time in 6 months! The only problem is, it does not last for 12 hours, after about 6 hours I start to crash then at 8-9 hours I start to get anxious and OCD. I don't know if I have to increase my dose but am unsure because of heart issues it causes. Pros: Helps with organization, I am excited about things for the first time when I was a teenager. My symptoms went from more external ADD to internal ADD as I became an adult' Cons: Does not last full 12 hours, can make me moody.",8,37
Vyvanse,"I'm 17 and on 60 mg of Vyvanse. I weigh about 112 lbs. I don't know if it's too high a dose, but ever since I got it increased from 50 to 60mg. I've been feeling actually tired, which is a surprise to me because it's a stimulant. I've also had more intense dizziness and headaches, and I had heart palpitations on the 50, but now they're more frequent, and chest pain, heart races, but I'm able to focus a little better.",7,21
Vyvanse,I'm 16. Starting taking this medicine to help my depression and actually stop me from binge eating. I have only been on it for 2 weeks and have lost close to 8 lbs. This is the best pill ever!,0,15
Vyvanse,"I have tried typing a response and recommendation for this medication but keep running out of space.  In short, this drug absolutely changed my life.  As adults, we all remember certain days in our life, i.e., our first kiss, graduation, birth of a child, getting married, etc.  I will always remember Saturday, December 8, 2007 as the day where my life changed because of Vyvanse.  The only side effect for me was a complete loss of appetite for about a month.  But in my case, that's not such a bad thing!  I was taking 50mg for about 6 months and now have taken 70mgs for the last 16 months.",10,56
Vyvanse,"I used this medication during the last school year, but it didn't help me much. My grades were still failing and I had no appetite. I was also very depressed. I have been off it for a while now, and my grades have significantly improved compared to what they were.",3,24
Vyvanse,"I started this medication yesterday. 1st day was great, I felt alert and motivated. On the 2nd day, I could not focus very well, once I realized I can't focus I started getting stressed and then out of no where I felt great sadness come over me and cried for two hours.  This medication clearly altered my emotional state.  Pros- lasts throughout the day, does suppress appetite for those of us looking to shed few pounds.",5,10
Vyvanse,"I am a 20 year old college student who was working full time when I started taking this medicine, Vyvanse. At the time when I was first given this medicine I was about 140lbs and I'm 5'7. And after about 4 months of taking the Vyvanse I weighed anywhere between 115-120lbs. Not good! The medicine made me totally not eat and run around like I was on drugs and couldn't sit still. I became so skinny I could see all of my ribs. I also felt like I had lost all emotions and the relationship with my parents were harmed because of this. I think part of the problem was the doctor just upping my dose whenever he felt like it and not being very responsible. But I just want to warn anyone who is thinking about taking Vyvanse to be careful and have a doctor who cares.",7,56
Vyvanse,"The only bad thing is it acts like a diet pill, so I hardly eat. It seems to make me act like an efficient robot, so I always have to be doiing something productive, without showing emotion or change in facial expression.",8,25
Vyvanse,"Works better than Concerta for ADHD-IA for attentiveness as well as alertness. Far superior to Concerta in regards to affecting sleep. Vyvanse doesn't keep you awake. Also seems to contrast greatly to Concerta's method of dealing with attentiveness. Makes a less zombie-like state of concentration and lets you break task when needed. An added effect is that of a more positive sense of well-being; most likely attributed to its amphetamine-based nature. The greatest advantage is the delayed release into the body. Great for those whose metabolisms don't react well to Adderall XR or Concerta. Only wished it lasted about two hours longer in the body, but adapting dose time is acceptable.",7,45
Vyvanse,"I'm a 18 year old college freshman and started taking Vyvanse 10 months ago when I had finally gotten medicated for my severe ADD.  It has significantly changed my life for the better. For as long as I can remember, my teachers always told my parents that I was very bright but I just would not apply myself but after taking Vyvanse my grades have skyrocketed. I can finally pay attention in class and actually absorb the information. I feel energized, motivated, and more organized to do things.  My days will be filled with productivity and I feel like it boosts my mood in general. My side effects include a slight anxiety because I feel like I should ALWAYS be doing something productive so sometimes its hard for me to relax.",9,46
Vyvanse,This medicine (along with talk therapy) has helped me get my life back on track after being 98% disabled.,9,12
Vyvanse,"My daughter is 8 and has tried other medicines for ADHD. I did not like them because of the side effects, she was like a zombie. With the Vyvanse, I don't notice a major change in her personality.  AND, she is focusing better in school.  Much better grades.  I love this medicine because she still acts like MY DAUGHTER and not some alien.",10,136
Vyvanse,It changed my life,10,9
Vyvanse,Great and helps pay attention but if you take a high dose (30mg or more) it can give really severe headaches. Drinking caffeinated drinks may help reduce it.,9,15
Vyvanse,"I'm 51-years old and was skeptical regarding ADD or ADHD. A counselor urged me to get tested. I agreed to do it because all I wanted was help. I no longer cared what the answer was for whatever was wrong. I only cared if it worked. So, I did the test and was told I was off the charts the highest scores they had seen in years of testing. Today I take 120-150 mgs of Vyvanse daily and it makes a difference. Nonetheless, even though Vyvanse has been very helpful, I still doubted whether ADHD was real. I couldn't understand why the medicine was so highly regulated. How could anyone get addicted to this stuff I thought? Then I realized people like me don't get high from drugs like this and that's one reason I know it's working and ADHD is real.",10,132
Vyvanse,I've been on and off Adderall XR for a couple years and I've always hated that 'crash' when the medicine starts wearing off. Vyvanse doesn't have that crash and it lasts a lot longer than Adderall. It's the best medicine I've been on so far.,8,34
Vyvanse,"I am a 27 y.o. male. My doctor started me on a Focalin XR 20 mg regimen a month ago to treat my ADD and hopefully control my anxiety at the same time. I loved the Focalin for the first week or so that I was on. I could immediately tell a huge difference in my mood, concentration, focus and general outlook on life. My anxiety was decreased tremendously as well. As the month went on I started to notice that the Focalin was very hot and cold. Some days I would feel on top of the world and other days it didn't seem to work at all. My irritability increased too, so my doctor has switched me to Vyvanse 40 mg. This is my first day on it and no complaints so far.",7,3
Vyvanse,"This medication has done wonders for my son. He's been on it now for about 2years, and it really helps him concentrate in school and at home. Last year he brought home a's and b's and hes 9 years old! I am so proud of him!",10,25
Vyvanse,"I am a 23 year old female. My entire life I have tested highly, been in advanced classes, had a full scholarship through college, but my grades were always a struggle. I felt like I had to work so much harder than everyone else just to keep my B grades. I was disorganized, forgetful, irritable, and pretty desolate. I felt like I was drowning. I have taken medication for depression and anxiety since I was in high school - everything from Wellbutrin, to Xanax, to Prozac. I graduated from college in four years with a mediocre GPA, but with many awards. Finally my new doctor actually listened when I spoke, and she agreed that we try a course of medication for ADHD. I am on my second week of Vyvanse and am a new, happy, functioning person.",9,59
Vyvanse,"I'm 16 years old, and I've just recently started taking Vyvanse. I just started taking a new pill for my depression. Zoloft, which started helping. But I could notice a HUGE difference with Vyvanse right away. I am much more talkative, been in a better mood, less lazy, and I actually don't mind cleaning my room every now and then. I used to fight with my boyfriend all the time about things, which I now realize should have been no big deal at all. But now, things have changed. I'm excited for school, even because I want to see if Vyvanse will help me bring up my grades and concentrate better, instead of falling asleep in class. Some side effects I've noticed though is not having an appetite, and talking too much.",9,22
Vyvanse,My son started taking this medicine about 9 months ago.  His grades went from C's and D's to A's and B's. He is able to focus and concetrate.  He isn't a zombie walking around the house.  He still has some emotion and can still have fun.  I love this medicine because even he can see the diffence it has made in his life.,9,35
Vyvanse,"I started using this medication about 4 months ago. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 5 years old. The only annoying thing about this medication is that it keeps my mouth extremely dry. I found that using hard candies (regular or sugar free) helps a lot. Vyvanse has helped me a lot, especially with my concentration. I can actually read a book without having to read the same page 3 times, but the only thing is that it feels like my blood pressure goes up, I also have tachycardia.",10,18
Vyvanse,I started Vyvanse at 15 after a 2 year run on Concerta which I hated. When I started Vyvanse I was 5'8 150lbs. I started on the 30 mg dose and within a year was down to 132 pounds. The medicine works like a charm but makes it near impossible for me to eat.,5,15
Vyvanse,"I'm a 20 year old college student and have been taking Vyvanse for about 6 months now.  Honestly, I love this medication, as it has helped me in almost every aspect of life.  My grades as well as my confidence in social situations are better than ever.  The only slightly annoying side effect that hasn't gone away is that I find my mouth sometimes getting extremely dry.  Sometimes I'll notice that my breath smells funny as a result, and I find myself going through a lot of gum and breath mints, and even brushing my teeth randomly throughout the day. Overall though, Vyvanse has been a miracle for me.",9,31
Vyvanse,I am a 19 year old college student and just got prescribed Vyvanse about 2 days ago. When I take it I mainly feel relaxed and sometimes excited. I've never been on any stimulant or ADD medication before. My main concern is losing weight on this medicine. I'm about 5'9 and weigh about 135lbs. I eat a lot and I'm still fairly skinny. I've always worried about my weight and the last thing I want is to get skinnier.,5,6
Vyvanse,"I've been using Vyvanse to treat my ADHD for about a month now and I have to say, I could feel the positive effects pretty much instantly. I've accomplished more in a month with this medicine than I had in a year prior to using it. The one issue I did encounter was an increase to my already existent problem with insomnia but having started taking Trazodone has counteracted this issue. It should be noted that not everyone has the same reaction to any given drug but as for me, nothing I've tried in the past has been NEAR as effective. A  (Note: In comparison to other drugs I've tried similar to Vyvanse I've found that it gives me the benefits I need without the overwhelming tweaked out feeling that others caused for me)",10,27
Vyvanse,Gave me back my life,9,16
Vyvanse,"I am 55 years old and was diagnosed with ADD only last year.  I changed from Adderall XR to Vyvanse and after 3 weeks, I am having anxiety and total lack of focus.  It seems to make me more agitated and more easily distracted.  There is definitely not a focus benefit for me on this drug.",1,32
Vyvanse,"When I started receiving calls from my kindergarteners teacher at least once a week, I couldn't believe it. But after several months of struggling through the seemingly easiest of tasks I decided to take my daughter to counseling. Her counselor and psychiatrist took all of the right steps to diagnose her ADHD, and after 6 weeks of holding on to the prescription, I gave in and started administering the 20mg of Vyvanse. My daughter made a complete turn-around! Happy in the morning, soaring at school, and even sleeping well at night! In a month after starting Vyvanse, she was awarded student of the month, by the end of school she was most improved student of the year. My only concern is that she already needs the 30mg dose.",9,125
Vyvanse,"I started Vyvanse about 5 months ago.  My doctor first had me on Focalin which helped, but didn't seem to get me all the way there.  Since I have generalized anxiety disorder he started with Focalin.  He said Focalin was a gentler medication.  After about 2 weeks he started Vyvanse at 20mg. I really started to like the medication: more focus, motivation.  I have worked my way up to 50mg.  After a couple of weeks on each dose, the medication doesn't last the whole 12 hours.  I do really like the medication.  I just hope that I don't have to keep going up with the dosage.",3,18
Vyvanse,This is the third medicine my daughter has been on this year. Although the other two worked for her ADHD the side effects where not very great. Vyvanse has worked all the way around for her. I am very pleased to have finally found something that has worked for her.,10,20
Vyvanse,I would have to agree that Vyvanse has helped extremely with my Adult ADHD and Social Phobia. It is a lot smoother than Adderall XR and doesn't upset my stomach like Concerta used to do. I also take it with Lexapro for my generalized anxiety disorder and have yet to experience any contraindications.,7,20
Vyvanse,I am 19 and was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in elementary school. I have had my fair share of ADD/ADHD drugs that I have liked or disliked. For years I had been taking Concerta but I felt like it didn't do much for me. My grades started slipping during my sophmore year in high school and I decided that enough was enough. So I did some research and started reading about Vyvanse. My doctor didn't know much about it because it is a fairly new drug. I started taking 50mg of Vyvanse when I was 18 and have seen nothing but positive effects. I went from a 3.0 to a 4.1 GPA. It only lasts for about 5-6 hours so my doctor perscribed 5mg of Adderall to take. I have loads of studying to do. This drug is simply wonderful. The reviews are helpful.,10,26
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse has helped me tremendously. I'm a 26 year old college student diagnosed with ADD. I started out taking 50mg and it was only working for about 4-6 hours so after a few months the doctor took me up to 70mg that lasts me 8-10 hours, which is GREAT. It helps me focus so much and get things done, plus I'm making way better grades.",9,63
Vyvanse,"I am a 21 year old male diagnosed with ADD around 4 years ago. About a while back I was prescribed to 50mg of Vyvanse. So far its effects have been very positive. In the past, I have been on Strattera and Adderall. The eupohric feeling Adderall produces brings a high potential for abuse and dependence, along with extreme mood changes and irratability. With Vyvanse, the urge for more does not exist. It is consistent throughout most of the day and delivers concentration and a sense of confidence and well-being. I've had slightly decreased appetite, but am much more productive and focused. I feel that I have gotten my life back. It is the best ADD medicine I have been on. Highly recommended.",9,61
Vyvanse,"My kids do great in school, but on weekends I do not give the Vyvanse to them, they just sit and stare at the walls.",5,32
Vyvanse,My son has had ADHD for as long as I can remember. We have been through 5 different ADHD medicines with some sort of side affect with each one. I started doing research and finding out what my options were. I found the Vyvanse by accident and I had to find out more. What I read was so amazing I wanted it for my son. I couldn't believe how hard it was to get the Doctors to understand I knew what I was doing and I was going to do whatever it took to get my son the proper help. Well needless to say my son has been on this medicine for quite a few months now and the difference is Amazing. He went from D and F's (not kidding) to an A student in this past report card. To see the smile on his face and the sense of accomplishment was worth it all.,9,100
Vyvanse,"My son has been taking the medication for a week on Tuesday and all I have to say is that he is doing a lot better. His teacher noticed a difference on the first day, so did my son. He stated to me that he can actually focus on lessons and listen to the lesson with no problem.  The only thing that I can say is that my son said that he doesn't want to eat as much but he eats anyway because he knows he needs to and at night he wakes up once.  The doctor did tell us that, that may happen in the beginning but that it will ware off.",10,36
Vyvanse,"I'm a 20 year old college student and I've been on Vyvanse 30 mg for a year and a half. When I first started taking Vyvanse it was amazing but it's effects have become very mild at this point. I probably need to get my doctor to bump up my dose. If I take a week off or don't take it as frequently I get much better results. Overall, I feel in complete control when I take it and my confidence is very high. However, sometimes when I'm on it I experience feelings of extreme worry about the future; these feelings are always very brief though and don't infringe on my well-being at all.",7,42
Vyvanse,It is magic,10,18
Vyvanse,"Consistent control of ADHD, able to focus without drastic drop off in evenings.",10,15
Vyvanse,"I am 16 and I started using Vyvanse a little over one month ago. I am a very bright student but I found myself struggling through school. I was diagnosed with ADD around 4th grade. I have always had trouble focusing and staying on task. I tried Concerta, Ritalin, Strattera and Adderal. After taking those I took about a 4 year break from medicine. I began Welbutrin and am now taking that in combination with Vyvanse. My grades improved tremendously. I can now focus and it shows. I went from a D in Algebra/Geo to an A. My life and confidence has improved more than I ever thought possible. I do have decreased appetite but other than that, this medicine is literally making my future brighter everyday.",9,120
Vyvanse,I am 19 now and started taking ADD medicines when I was 17. I had used Adderall for a few months and had to stop because of the 'rebound' I got from it. It made me too agitated and easily angry/sad when coming down on it near the end of the day. I switched to Focalin XR and it worked well for maybe another month before the same thing started happening. My doctor then wanted to try one more time so he said there is a newer stimulant out for ADD/ADHD and it is pretty much like a cousin of Adderall. He said there is a better chance that this won't have a negative rebound. I have been on 60mg of Vyvanse for a few months and I have not felt any type of negative side-effects like I had before. It works great and helps me stay focused with school and work.,10,26
Vyvanse,My son is 12 and uses Vyvanse 50mg. I have seen a big difference in his behavior and attitude. We tried quite a few other ADHD prescriptions but this one is a miracle.,10,18
Vyvanse,"Im 17 and have always had a hard time with my depression and Bi-polar disorder. I take medication for them and it's helped but there was still my motivation lacking. I was prescribed Vyvanse and the first day I took it I knew it was the miracle I had been waiting for. It helps my motivation tremendously whether its school work or not, I get more done. And am actually enthusiastic about doing it. The only semi bad thing about it I would say is anxiety. My arms especially get very anxious.",9,20
Vyvanse,My Grandson was diagnosed with ADHD two years ago when he was 7. We started him in councelling and they recommended we try medication. I resisted not knowing much about ADHD.  They tried him on a couple of different medicines (without success) before we tried Vyvanse the first dose 30mg did show a vast improvement but it didn't last long. We increased the doses several times before reaching his current dose of 60mg.  Like the others have stated he has loss of appetite and trouble going to sleep. They continually monitor his weight and take blood samples to make sure there is no harm to liver and kidneys. He still has occasional meltdowns which we have learned to recognize. In school he has gone from impulsive to compulsive but again it runs in spurts.,9,24
Vyvanse,"I have been using 70 mg Vyvanse and it was working perfectly for a month, in fact, it still works.  The problem is that my blood pressure, which was perfect, went up 30 points in a month and now I'm at risk for high blood pressure. Also, I lost weight which I must gain back now.  I'm only 16 and this is bad. I'm lean and athletic and have never had any health issues until this. Besides all of this, I really like Vyvanse and hopefully won't have to stop taking it.",9,17
Vyvanse,I've used it for my son and it obviously works the way it should.,9,6
Vyvanse,I took a 30 mg dose of Vyvanse and it helped me focus all day. I feel much less depressed and have not noticed any nervous side effects. I have read that it makes sleeping difficult and will find out tonight. I like it.,10,10
Vyvanse,Absolute MIRACLE pill. I am 17 and take Vyvanse. I went from being sleeping in class F student to being more focused and motivated to do my work and now my F's are A's and B's. It also made me so much more social and happy. One bad thing is that I do have trouble sleeping and that's really the only bad thing about this drug. It also causes decrease in appetite and weight loss.,0,31
Vyvanse,"42 year old male recently diagnosed with ADD (no hyperactivity).  Vyvanse is the only medication I've tried and I'm reasonably happy with it.  Started 30 mg for 2 weeks.  Felt a little jittery and had a funny taste in my mouth.  Increased to 70 mg.  No longer feel jittery, no funny taste, but my mouth is always dry so I drink a lot of water. Vyvanse seems to help me get more done.  I can't say I'm more focused, but I am more motivated, so the end result is more productivity, though not always directed in the best place. It decreased my appetite, so it was easier to switch to a healthier diet.  Lost more than 25 lbs. in first 3 months, which has also helped increase self esteem, motivation and energy level.",9,155
Vyvanse,This medication was basically my savior. I was diagnosed in the Fall semester of my junior year of college and I was put on Adderall XR. I was a mess on the Adderall. I started 50 mg of Vyvanse and I take it everyday for work and school. It's amazing. The only real side effect I have is that I am more talkative. I love that you do not feel the peaks (with time release) with Vyvanse.,9,24
Vyvanse,"I am 16 and was recently diagnosed with ADD. I find Vyvanse extremely helpful for the first 6 hours, and then as I come off of it I often have a depressive mood swing for about an hour. I have been trying other medications but Vyvanse works the best for me (except for the mood swings). I am almost never hungry. I have lost about 22lbs in 2 months. It's important to keep a regular eating schedule. I continue to try different medications, but this one has extremely changed my life for the better in school and in social settings.",8,17
Vyvanse,My 7 year old started taking Vyvanse last week.  The same day she started the drug her teacher could tell she was doing much better.  It has given her a voice and she is on top of the world and so proud of herself.  She is so happy and so am I. I was always so sad because I couldn't help her and now Vyvanse has helped.,10,24
Vyvanse,I was on Ritalin for years until my doctor put me on Vyvanse. Vyvanse kicks in 'quietly' and lasts longer.,10,14
Vyvanse,"I took Vyvanse 50mg for about 4 months. As I started the medication everything was going great and I was focused. However, I was an emotional wreck while on it. People at work thought I was going crazy because I was angry at silly things, which is not my personality at all. Vyvanse seemed to work good in the mornings but wore off around 1pm. I took it around 7:30am. The medication really depends on what you eat. 12 hours is not true for me. I don't know about you but I don't have time to make sure I eat this type of food for dinner and this type for breakfast just so my my medicines will work. Some days the Vyvanse would not work at all and I didn't get anything done. Vyvanse also caused hair loss and turned grey. I'm 25 yrs old.",1,62
Vyvanse,Vyvanse didn't work for me. I had to switch back to Adderall XR. Vyvanse had no effect on my mood or concentration levels at all.,4,11
Vyvanse,A miracle pill. First time in my life I finally feel normal and can function like a normal person.,10,23
Vyvanse,My 12 years old son started Vyvanse 30mg more than one month ago. He is happy with the result in school. But what bothers me is he is kind of in slow motion especially in school (the teachers reported that).,8,24
Vyvanse,Had trouble sleeping.,8,13
Vyvanse,"My daughter has been on Vyvanse for about 4 weeks. I have seen the difference in grades, work habits at school and somewhat at home. My only concern is her not eating as much for lunch, but when she gets home she is ready to eat up everything.",0,21
Vyvanse,Very strong. The best ADHD medication.,10,10
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse has worked great for me. Before I started taking the medication I was like a walking zombie. I was zoned out about 90% of the day. Since I have started Vyvanse I can tell a huge difference and so can my family and friends. They say that I am more talkative and a great listener now and that I also seem much happier. The only downfall of this medication is some of the side effects, as in loss of appetite and sometimes I get headaches. I think I can deal with the side effects.",9,90
Vyvanse,Vyvanse has worked wonders for me. It doesn't have the crash that other ADHD medications gave me and still keeps my attention up.,7,15
Vyvanse,"My son, 12, is on 20 mg of Vyvanse.  He is ADHD and has reacted poorly to most of the other stimulants we tried.  The 30 mg caused him to have side effects of stomach pains and emotional irritability and rebound problems.  By switching him to 20 mg he is able to maintain his junior high honors classes and be functionable and focused. By going down to the 20 mg he is able to have a personality and yet not be flicking and annoying people.  Without the medicine he was unable to stay seated at the piano to practice and now he is proficient and can practice on his own without me telling him to sit down every 3 minutes.  It has also been a tremendous self esteem boost.",8,41
Vyvanse,This medicine has changed my life as a student and a person.,10,20
Vyvanse,"Works better than any other stimulant medicine I have tried. I have sensitivity to stimulants; it causes bruxism. The bruxism is absent with a 20 mg dose, and minimal with a 30 mg dose. Other Stimulants - I cannot take even the lowest dose without getting the bruxism side-effect to the point I can't stand it. Also, I can't feel when it starts working and stops working - which is great. It wears off slowly starting about 7-8 hours after I take it. After 10-11 hours I do not feel it in my system anymore. No Insomnia or crashing feeling. Weight loss (ok since I am fat) about 25 lbs in 3 months. My only complaint is it makes me want to smoke. I quit smoking a long time ago. I think about wanting to have a cigarette several times a day.",9,169
Vyvanse,This drug is the best thing. I have more energy. Can do more things and my mind is not thinking 100 things at once.,10,48
Vyvanse,"I'm a 24 year old male. I was on Adderall XR 30mg (daily) for around 3-4 years before my Doctor suggested we try Vyvanse. I have always been pleased with Adderall XR and have no complaints about side effects. Vvyanse (60mg daily) worked as advertised for a about 3-4 days. It was like an upgraded Adderall XR (provided a longer half life that is much needed for my schedule of college and work). Unfortunately, the drug drastically lost its effectiveness. The dry mouth was extreme as well. After just 10 days taking 2 at a time had no effect. Went back to adderall xr and I'm still impressed.",6,23
Vyvanse,It works. Less is better anything over 15-20 mg makes me too focused.,10,21
Vyvanse,"I have identical twin boys that are eight years old. They were both diagnosed with ADHD at a young age. At first we did everything possible to avoid medicines. After 1 year we started with adderall the extended and immediate release, 2 pills a day and were impressed. It's effectiveness was noticeable once the medicine wore off (moodiness, short temper,and rebound hyperactivity). After 2 years we were introduced to Vyvanse and it is great. They only take one pill daily and it lasts 11-12 hours without the rebound side effects. The only problem is eating they don't have much of an appetite throughout the day.",10,74
Vyvanse,It's awesome. I can now concentrate in school and on my homework and im now getting A's on my tests. It's simply amazing.,10,27
Vyvanse,"My 8 year old son was diagnosed with ADHD when he started Kindergarten. It was horrible. His doctor put him on Focalin XR. It worked pretty good, it definitely calmed him down and helped him concentrate in class. But after a while I noticed his appetite decreased immensely and he started losing weight. So in April of 08` his doctor switched him to Vyvanse and it is amazing. His appetite is normal, he's doing very well in school, and he's making lots of friends. Our lives have changed for the better thanks to Vyvanse.",10,73
Vyvanse,"I've been really pleased with the way vyvanse has helped me. On Vyvanse I'm not moody or lifeless like I had been on other drugs. My appetite is still very small and this is kind of a problem because I'm really light anyways. However, if I eat before I take it and snack on healthy things during school hours I don't crash when it wears off. With Vyvanse I've realized it's possible to control my ADD and keep my personality! I was VERY nervous about starting a new drug, but Vyvanse is really the best thing I've tried and my grades in my AP classes are better than they have ever been.",8,37
Vyvanse,"My son was DX with ADHD in Kindergarten.  We have tried several different medicines.  Vyvanse has been the best one yet.  He is calmer and more focused in class.  As with the other drugs he does experience side effects: no appetite, a little on the moody side.  Overall this has been the best medicine we have tried to date.",9,25
Vyvanse,I am a 20 year old male. I have taken  Vyvanse to help me focus better on my tasks and also to improve my concentration. Vyvanse is a wonderful medication with very little negative side effects.,9,19
Vyvanse,"I loved the intended effects of Vyvanse, as it worked better than anything else I've tried.  However, I was not able to tolerate the stomach-related side effects.  I still want to try it again once other problems with my stomach are resolved, to see if I can tolerate it then.",7,11
Vyvanse,"I feel as though Vyvanse allows me to not feel the ups and downs. I don't always have to be doing something but I am concentrated and alert to what I have to do. I started taking vyvanse for the past year and a half and I went from a B student to a 4.0, international student.",9,22
Vyvanse,"I have a son that has struggled with an attention problem in school since kindergarden. He is now 11 years old. We tried everything not to put him on medication. The homework struggle and impulsiveness became too much for us to handle, and we finally agreed to try something. His doctor told us about a new ADHD medication called Vyvanse. Believe this or not, it was like magic the first day. He was able to get all his work done in class, and went from a A,B,C student to all A's and one B in one quarter. We have the report cards to prove it. The side effects are minimal and for him the 30mg works great. I encourage anyone battling this problem to ask their childs doctor about Vyvanse. It has changed by sons life as well as ours.",10,183
Vyvanse,"I have had past drug abuse problems with Ritalin and adderall. My doc started me on 50mg of Vyvanse because of less opportunity for abuse.  It works well and is nearly impossible to abuse.  If you take more than the prescribed dose, you don't get the euphoric high that Ritalin and Adderall provides so there is no use to try to abuse it.",9,102
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse is probably one of the more successful attempts by pharmaceutical companies to create a medication for ADD/ADHD that doesn't carry the negative repercussions other, older medications have, i.e. anxiety, anorexia, insomnia, etc. It's amazing.",9,72
Vyvanse,"Vyvanse has been amazing for me. I used to take Adderall, which made me moody, self-conscious, unhappy with myself and life, and far from  my true personality. I now take 70 mg Vyvanse and it has worked miracles. I feel I am my true self but with controlled ADHD symptoms. Now, when I need to concentrate, I am now able to thanks to Vyvanse.",10,51
Vyvanse,"Incredible.  I was on Adderall for over a year.  My doctor switched me to Vyvanse four days ago.  Since day one, I have felt better than ever.  That nervous-jittery feeling (perfect description) as well as anxiety and teeth-grinding that I had while on Adderall is totally gone.  I feel normal. I am able to concentrate and focus calmly, and am no longer plagued by excessive energy.  I feel healthy, and everyone around me has noticed the positive difference in such a short amount of time.",10,177
Vyvanse,I started this pill at the beginning of the school year and it definitely helped me with school. At first I was and still am a considerably shy teen than my classmates. I don't know if it's the pill but I felt very socially detached but not as much now. Another thing is I used to be at least 13 pounds heavier but after taking this pill I've lost all my extra weight.,7,17
Vyvanse,"Wow what a difference maker.  I am a young Male (30ish) and have found that Vyvanse has been such a life changer. I am gettiing so much more done at work. When I go home at night I find myself enjoying my time with my children more. I am not getting the crash effect I was experiencing with other medicines. That reason alone is so worth it. I have not had any side effects, well maybe minor dry mouth, but it last me 12-13 hours.  It is truly an awesome medication. I would recommend it.",10,75
Vyvanse,I have to say that this has been a great drug that has done so many good things for my Granddaughter that I have adopted. She is 7 years old with ADHD.  She was so unhappy and would even tell me that she knew something wasn't right and wanted to be a good kid like the ones in her class room. She was in tears and asking for help. This is the first drug for her ADHD and it has worked great! Some side effect not eating and not sleeping good at night.  But over all this drug has work great so far.,10,41
Vyvanse,"My son age 12) has been on this medication for 2 1/2 weeks now. He was on Dexedrine,which we felt was doing very well on his focus which gave him better grades,but it lacked in controlling  impulsive behavior. We see a noticeable difference in this issue with Vyvance 30mg.once a day. The only thing that we do notice clearly is lack of appetite at supper time and you can actually tell when his medication has worn off. His undesirable behavior is back) also becomes fidgety.",8,26
Vyvanse,I am 45 and was diagnosed with ADD &amp; dyslexia when i was a child. Didn't know about it until i was 40. Tried many other meds and would  highly recommend Vyvanse. The best part is not having the nervous-jittery feeling. I don't realize I am on it during the day. I am glad my doctor recommended it to me.,10,27
Vyvanse,"My 9 yr old son starting taking this medicine 1 month ago. He was on Medadate CD for 3 yrs before this. It has been wonderful so far.  His grades, homework time, handwriting, behavior and overall outlook on things have changed for the better.  The side effects are no appetite and trouble settling down at night but they are getting better. My only advise is to feed them a very good breakfast before giving the medicine and have good meal waiting when they come off.",9,143
Vyvanse,My 9 year old son started taking Vyvanse when all the other ADHD meds failed. Although he still had his fits sometimes they are few and far between. His grades in school are improving and he is able to pay attention better.,9,24
Vyvanse,"I started taking this pill and immediately noticed the difference. My life literally changed the moment I took the first pill. While I suffered from uncontrollable speech the first 2 days but my body adjusted. I started with 50mg and I now take 70mg. I am 23 years old. Some other side effects I have experienced are decreased sexual drive, loss of weight and appetite. However, I can concentrate on anything. This pill has taken the characteristic of lazy out of me. I am more productive than ever.",10,226
Vyvanse,My 11 year old son just started taking Vyvanse 1 month ago and I can already see the differences in his grades. He would study and do homework all week and not retain any of the information and fail test after test. Since starting Vyvanse he has passed 3 tests. I wish I would have started him on it earlier. Downside - upset stomach if I dont make him eat right after taking it. So on our way out the door we have a vyvanese and a Trail Mix bar to coat the stomach. He gets a full 7 hours.,9,37
Vyvanse,"I'm 43 female ADHD, tried other medications, hated the up and down jittery feelings.  Started Vyvanse 30mg 6 months ago, moved to 70mg now.

Vyvanse,"I am 36 started on Concerta 2 years ago and built a resistance to it, so I went on Vyvance and what a difference in my life. I didn't have the rollarcoaster effects and the crashing arond the crucial time periods between 3-6pm Only down side is that I am fighting my insurance company as they do not want to pay for vyvance as it is more expensive than concerta.  However, it is actually costing more cuz I am also taking Xanax and Ritilin on top of the concerta.Vyvance is a miracle drug for ADHD",0,77

I would notice my depression would get worse which made my attention span shorter but after several years I decided to enter nursing school and right off the bat my fundamentals teacher told me that I was struggling to pay attention and that I seemed tired and so she advised me to go see a different psychiatrist. I did take her advice and I went to a different psychiatrist and he believed I had borderline ADD non-hyperactive which he prescribed me Vyvanse and after 3 months of adjusting I experienced the willingness to participate in more conversations and wanting to engage in certain school activities which made me more happy and energized.,0,4

I don't eat nearly enough and work really hard plus golf a lot in the heat. I don't necessarily feel sick I just have zero desire to ever eat.

It does not reduce my appetite at all, I have managed to unintentionally gain weight on it, it does not cause any sickness nervousness or irritability that can't otherwise be explained by caffeine or the environment.

I have always had trouble paying attention, would drift off, daydream, get stuck in my head. My grades in high school weren't bad, but they definitely could have been better if I didn't procrastinate and be lazy all of the time and keep putting things off. Because of this, I suffered depression and lack of self esteem because I thought others were better or smarter than me. That being said, there is anxiety when the drug wears off and unfortunately, the effects of the drug itself don't last long for me, I'd say about 4 hours max. So I always have my days planned out in order to maximize my productivity. But I am in a much better place in my life now. 21 years old in CC planning to transfer soon and much more motivated and driven.  One more thing. This medication is not for everyone.

Despite the claims, it is not non-addictive and it does cause addiction in some individuals.  I've seen it in kids and adults. If you are using it for your kids, I don't judge you (because medication can be life changing and necessary for functioning), just monitor emotional/social side effects. I hope it works well for some people, but I've seen it cause so much turmoil.",0,27
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 Ive been on vyvanse for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it. I was on adderall on and off for about 8 years and I hated taking it. It helped immensely with my ADHD, but not without side effects. I also had to take about 3 increasing doses a day to keep the effect going. I switched to 70 mg of Vyvanse once a day and it lasts all day long. The side effects are very minimal and it doesnt affect my appetite or social skills. There is no high and no crash. Adderall made me very aware that I was on medication, whereas Vyvanse is much less intense and has a very smooth feeling.",0,38
Lisdexamfetamine,<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 Both my daughter and I take Vyvanse for ADD/ADHD. It has helped us significantly. My daughter initially tried Biphentin but it did not help her symptoms and caused her not to eat or sleep. With Vyvanse there is a dramatic improvement of her symptoms and less side effects. It just suppresses her appetite. We take her off occasionally to help her appetite and have also tried a short acting formulation  that she takes after breakfast and again after lunch so her appetite isnt as effected.  I experience very good results on Vyvanse as well (and dont mind curbing my appetite slightly).,0,16
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 My (unprofessional) advice is to take positive reviews from people who have taken this drug for a short time with a very large grain of salt.  Vyvanse is basically a legal amphetamine and the body takes time to react to it and eventually builds tolerance to it.  The Vyvyanse Crash is real, in  my experience, as many others have observed.  This often leads to patients continually upping their dosages.  As for ADD and ADHD, it is interesting that both have become epidemics in the U.S., but not in Europe.  I believe this is because in the US of the massive profitability pharmaceutical experience in developing new drugs for every affliction.  That is just my opinion.  Regular exercise and diet are natural ways to address depression, ADD, ADHD and other conditions.  Common sense, but the pharma companies can't profit from it.  Everyone's physiology is different, so give Vyvance a try.  I hope it helps you.",0,29

After taking the medication immediately I found my focus completely changed, I am now able to consistently and accurately focus on tasks, it has completely unlocked the potential I knew I have always had. One Side effect is dry mouth which isn't so dry it's irritable or even very noticeable, however, the slight lack of moisture has the effect of causing bad breath.  Another side effect is a reduction in patience, hence slight increase in anger, things seem more irritable however this is something you can easily control if you are aware of it. Last side effect is a great reduction in appetite, however this is not a major problem as I just eat food anyway.

I would drink alcohol to the point where I passed out because I couldn't sleep otherwise, and eventually became an opiate addict because it would actually take the edge off. I know that is not probably a very common result but it is not unheard of. I felt like I was not in control of myself. Heart rate and blood pressure goes up, weight goes down. Do not put children on this medicine. Finally I stopped all ADHD meds when I got clean, and actually learned how to USE MY ADHD TO MY ADVANTAGE.  I have a daughter.

Lisdexamfetamine,<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I have ADHD and am 62 yrs. old. I have been on this medication for 7 weeks. The last 4 weeks I have had sinus issues.

If it wasn't for the sinus issues I would continue taking it,0,6
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I had taken Vyvanse for many years and was slowly on the decline. I was deeply depressed and had an absolute hopeless and helpless outlook on life with no relief. I had psychosis, delusions and impulsive behavior which I never had. I began having issues with memory, thinking, reasoning, decision making, tasks, and  concentration.  I would become very agitated if being interrupted. I was very aggressive and agitated constantly, it was at least 98% of the time in 10 years.  I read horror stories about stimulants, namely the Amphetamine line of them. I subsequently tapered off of them and feel 100% better than before. I have no depressive symptoms, delusions, memory problems, agitation or aggressiveness. I was not happy with life and my personal relationships were very toxic. I wasted almost 10 years of my life feeling like this and have other personal complications that resulted from the use of these toxic drugs.",0,20

The first week were very emotionally happy. I felt like I stepped into life for the first time. But everyday at 2pm my ADHD would start returning. As time went on 2pm went from just ADHD to ADHD, extreme irritability, BAD headaches and nearly nonfunctional.  My doctor upped my dose but that did nothing. Currently waiting for my next appointment to switch medications.  If it actually lasted even just 8 hours I would stay on it.

It is so hard to know when you are in it that the medication is causing the symptoms. Now both of us are on 20mg Vyvance. Some occasional SI on my part, mild and very intermittent. Im also on Vybrid for GAD and he is on buspirone. Im not sure Im actually getting things done...I have an project Im anxious about Im just not doing it and Im on 40mg now.

Succeeding in soccer and being really social while on it. Coming off it wasnt that bad as I pretty much just went everyday then just decided to quit because I was so confident that I  didnt need the drug to do what I was doing. About a month later I lost all my confidence as my ADHD really brought down my confidence when I started falling behind in school and wasnt quite as social. I feel this drug does help with social anxiety which I also have. Strongly thinking about going back on it and I havent taking it in 2 years just not sure yet. Some side effects I did notice was agitation, loss of appetite, and abnormally emotional.",0,21

I love the feelings of motivation, effective working, and productivity! It takes about 30 mins to kick in for me  and I found it intriguing that they kick in time varies from person to person. Although,  it only lasts for about 4 to 5 hours and after that timeframe I become extremely irritated and slightly emotional. I take 70 mgs in the morning, and after reading the forum, Ive come to the conclusion that this reaction is probably due the amount that Ive been taking. Good luck all!",0,13
Lisdexamfetamine,<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 Zyprexa and Prozac for bipolar depression. 60mg Vyvanse for ADHD. Helpful but may need to increase to max dose of 70mg. I agree with the person who said he or she wished they could take it twice a day. Very smooth drug without excessive excitement or anxiety. Adderall XR is stronger than Vyvanse but the anxiety crash isn't worth it.,0,13
Lisdexamfetamine,<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 My whole entire school career I would pay attention to the teacher and listen and listen and just didnt get it like the other kids did. I wished every day that I could just be like all the normal kids and just some how be able to do my school work and pass tests. That was until 7th grade when I was prescribed Vyvanse 70mg once daily in the morning. IMMEDIATELY after that I started passing EVERY class with As and Bs (prior to being held back once in 2nd grade and every other grade after that getting the lowest possible grades almost failing every time) by 8th grade the school put me in honors classes. In 9th grade after 4 or 3 whatever years of taking Vyvance I joined my schools NJROTC program and joined drill teams. Things I would have NEVER been able to accomplish without the Vyvanse treating my ADHD. I recommend this medication highly. Not every medication works for everyone but this one works PERFECTLY for me.,0,44
Lisdexamfetamine,I started with Adderall.  From there I went on to Vyvanse 50mg.  It's very important for people to know what other meds you've tried.  After all you are comparing meds you've tried.  I noticed that a lot of people who like Vyvanse come from Adderall.  I liked Vyvanse for the first week.  The problem was the potency and the crash.  I experienced 3 hours of euphoria followed by 3 hours of hyper focus and then the final huge crash.  The super highs and super lows made life much worse for me. The thing was the Vyvanse had potential.  If it was more even throughout the day I might have something really good.  Adderall was ok. Too much irritability.  I wanted focus and mood benefits  not anger and excess energy.  After tons of research I found Dex.  I started on 10mg IR 3 times a day.  It had all the benefits without the massive ups and downs. I think people who have only taken Adderall will tend to like Vyvanse more.  I think most people who switch to dexamfetamine like it better.,3,0
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I switched from adderall to vyvanse 4 months ago.  I appreciate that Vyvanse requires an only 1 per day remembrance to take your medication.  For me, it hasn't resulted in any crash or high.  Consistent temperament and focus are experienced throughout my day.  I started at 50mg and felt sluggish and terribly unmotivated.  My doctor said I could half the dose, which has been a VAST improvement. With quieter thoughts, I'm sleeping through the night and some forethought has reduced the do it RIGHT NOW behavior.",0,19

Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 The first day I tried 10 mg of Vyvanse was amazing.  I had embarked on cleaning out our basement and noticed that I was getting a lot done without going around in circles like I normally do. Because of this I immediately thought I'd finally found the right drug for me. For the first week or two, it seemed I had. The downsides: For some reason, Vyvanse does not seem to help me regulate my emotions at all. I've been on Adderal, Ritalin, and dexedrine and all of those medications really inhibit my negative reactions to things that I find frustrating.  Vyvanse does nothing for this--bad drivers still make me crazy on Vyvanse. The other thing I've noticed, is by the end of the day, I am multitasking and talking people's ear off as if I am on something. I actually started to worry that people might think I was on cocaine--and I'm only taking 10 mil! It would be great if I could find a medication that was something in between this and the longer acting dexedrine.",0,24
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 When 2 months ago my psychiatrist wanted me to try this in lieu of adderall, I declined; however, impulse-driven behavior brought me to a desperate enough point to agree to it.      Although the trial is only 10 days underway and it stinks that it takes 2 hours to experience effects, I'm overall very pleased with the outcomes of this medication.  Compared to Adderall's effects, this medication imparts morning to evening evenness in mood and attention. For me the peaks and lulls have been replaced with overall calm. It does seem to be a little too calming, but that may be because my brain has adapted itself to chaos. Even if that doesn't diminish with time, I'd prefer that to crazy.",0,23
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 In Switzerland is called Elvanse. I looked for a real specialist psychiatry for my ADHD which is very strong, I can't stay sit for 2 minutes, when  sitting my legs shakes so much, when I stay up, I walk everywhere without knowing where I'm going, once or twice a week I take the wrong train and end my travel anywhere..I get stressed for anything, I loose my mobile monthly, also my keys, my wallet, and so many things I lost. I have real strong ADHD disorder, sometimes I get so stress I get panic attack.  Well with Vyvanse alot of my symptoms have  gone now, I have maybe have 15% of ADHD .But my doctor has to prescribe me 210mg Vyvanse/day, I get for example 70mg at midnight to be able to sleep. If I don't take it I walk all night around my house and  I  have nightmares. With Vyvanse at night I sleep in one time and don't have nightmarres anymore....Well I could say more things but think its enough and don't have patience for it sorry Best regards",0,16
Lisdexamfetamine,<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 Was put on this medication senior year. I was an C student but after I was put on Vyvanse 60mg got straight As the whole year. I enjoyed going to school! The only thing I dont like about this medication is you get a very dry month. And you feel like you have to constantly be doing something or you feel like a mad man. Also the comedown in the beginning is awful. Midday I felt like a zombie and didnt have an emotion,0,18

Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 Vyvanse is more effective, longer lasting, and has less side effects than taking Adderall IR several times a day. Feels very smooth, and doesn't have much of a comedown. Anxiety is supposedly a side effect, but it actually seems to reduce my anxiety. In my experience: Vyvanse is the best, then Adderal and lastly Ritalin",0,19
Lisdexamfetamine,<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 Vyvanse is great if you need it for work but if you need to focus or read and comprehend it is not the right drug. For me it took 2-4 hours before it actually made a difference in focus making it a big no from me! Adderal XR is what I was given to replace Vyvanse and I'll just say that Adderal XR works and it doesn't make me feel horrible like Vyvanse did,0,7
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I was on Vyvanse 60mg after taking 25mg Adderall XR with a 10mg booster. At first I LOVED Vyvanse. I had no incredible highs or lows. Concentration was great but I had to be reminded to eat and drink. Then I would get so focused on tasks that I couldn't do anything else unless I finished them. Extreme tunnel vision. My mood started shifting and got depressed; not in the I'm so down feeling, but more of a lack of high in the day - almost zombie-like. It ripped all the love out of me and made everything a business decision. Increased apathy. I switched to Adzynes and hope to get back to me.",0,16
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I was diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD (resulting in extreme panic attacks) about 7 years ago. I went down the line, starting with antidepressants, then Adderall and, finally, Vyvanse. I had a hard time with Adderall as I felt the jolt after taking it daily, even with XR and I broke out with these horrible cyst-like pimples. My psychologist had heard of Vyvanse and recommended changing. I started with a low dose of 20mg.. And finally ended up with 60mg XR daily. It has been life-changer for me. I take one pill first thing in the morning and that's all she wrote ?. I haven't had a panic attack since I started them. My Dr. encourages me to go on drug holidays monthly, which keeps me from going up in dosage. I will say, if you go without them longer than about 5 days, there are the side effects of dry mouth and tension headaches which reside by day 3. Good luck and I do recommend for ADHD!!",0,34
Lisdexamfetamine,<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I starting vyvance 20mg two ago and I was having a big crash in the afternoon. My doctor decided to increase my dose 40mg. For the next 3 weeks I was wonderful but now I'm really depressed and anxious. I don't know if it is normal or not.,0,12
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I have been on Concerta almost all my life, but last year my mental health got uncontrollable. I got prescribed Prozac which I eventually got the right dose. But when I found the right dose I started to take Concerta again, I had dropped it during the summer. My depression got worse.  So my doctor prescribed me to a non stimulant ADHD drug which didn't work at all. So my psychiatrist this time prescribed me Vyvanse. Vyvanse didn't work at first, but after a while it did. Until my appetite went up, I know that's weird normally your appetite goes down. The doctor gave me a higher dose, and my appetite went back to normal but my concentration wasn't as good as it was. So he increased it one last time. I can concentrate so well, that I can work from 8 am- 9 pm non-stop. The only downfall is my appetite is almost gone. I concentrate all day that I don't take breaks. I can do my assignments, though. I think, the benefits outweighs the loss of appetite.",0,16

Since I also suffer with anxiety / depression for which I have been taking pregabalin for a number of years. When I 1st took Elvanse (along with my pregabalin) I have to say the response has been quite remarkable, almost life changing. I feel more focused, more motivated, more patient. I don't do things impulsively any more and I feel happy. However, I do think there must be some interaction between the 2 drugs as one day I didn't take my pregabalin just to see how I would feel. Well it was awful, but taking the two drugs together has been great. I do have side effects such as slight nausea, but my appetite is OK, my sleeping isn't great which it wasn't in the first place! The SE I can manage and are an acceptable pay off for the reduction in symptoms.",0,6
Lisdexamfetamine,<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 Vyvanse will make you concentrate BUT it will make you feel emotionally terrible. The 1st day I started taking Vyvanse it was incredible. I went out and mowed my lawn which I havent done in months and I got all of my work done. But at Day 2 I was deeply depressed. Ive never felt so low in my whole life. Its not worth being deeply depressed just so you can be more productive. I will never take this drug again in my entire life,0,24
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I got prescribed this because Methylphenidate was too short acting for me. I take 20 mg in the mid day, and it lasts until evening, I will up it to 30 mg soon. Works well for studying, but makes me feel asocial and sometimes it  gives me bouts of dizziness. It also gives me quite a crash at times, feels like I am hungover and my ADHD symptoms becomes worse than prior to taking the meds. All in all its worth it for me so far, because it gives me the motivation to actually sit down and study for my exams. Which is alpha, omega for my future.",0,8

I lost 15-20 lbs the first 1-2 years I took it but since have gained that weight back and maintained. Vyvanse definitely makes me more functional day to day. I tried Adderall IR and Adderall XR prior to this on several different dosages and did not do good at all, the XR was a little better but could not find the right dose, constantly felt bad and out of it, with Adderall the more I tried to take I got extremely drowsy and couldn't function.

I have to do remember to drink water because my job involves a lot of talking and dry mouth is huge and sometimes sweating (learned to wear tee shirts and dress lighter). Recently decided to take time off because I wonder about long term effects but I think after four years Ive lost many of the natural strategies I developed and was much more all over the place than I remember in university... very frustrating so I started again. I will always take med breaks though because I dont want to develop tolerance- also love my many qualities of having ADHD.

It takes a long time for the Vynase to kick in, but when it does it causes tremendous dry mouth like I've never experienced.  I would take it at 5am. At 10:30 I would feel dry mouth and anxiety for about an hour. On my ride home from work around 5:30pm, I got very drowsy. By 8:00pm  I was extremely drowsy and would fall asleep on the couch if I sat down to watch TV. This never happened with Adderall. My overall anxiety seems better while on the Vynase. My mood also stayed relatively constant throughout the day, versus the ups and downs I feel on IR Adderall. I found that my appetite actually increased on Vynase, and I gained 8 pounds in 1 month which is unacceptable to me. Nothing else changed in my life except the medication, and I attribute the weight gain to this. Also, constipation was worse.

Here is what else you can expect. A complete silencing of your minds racecar track of a thought pattern, or our non-stop noise, as I like to refer to it. Due to this calming of your mind you will feel more at peace, and in my experience at least, become a more friendly, less irritable, anxious and depressed person. Not only will you experience calmness of the mind, but of the body as well. When Im not medicated I will fidget with any and everything, flick my fingers and toes together, bite my nails, shift, and feel very restless. Yet when I'm medicated. I can remain still for hours at a time. So if you have been dealing with the issues I talked about above, seek treatment if its affecting your life too negatively.

My body has adjusted to the stimulant affects but concentration &amp; focus has improved but the issue is it works for a limited amount of time.  Vyvanse is a pro drug it takes anywhere from 1-2 hours to kick in. Once mine kicks in Im locked in for a solid 4 hours &amp; then it starts to evaporate quickly. Vyvanse is a great medicine &amp; it has helped me immensely but I dont think its powerful enough to mask the symptoms I deal with on a daily basis. I gave it a 9 because the potential it has is. The downside is youre not hungry at all. You have to force yourself to eat. Ive been on this medication for 3 months. When I started taking it I was 200lbs. Im currently 170lbs. I recommend to eat something in that 1-2 hour window you have before the meds kick in,0,15

At least it kept me awake and slightly more focused than I would be without the medication, but I'm going to explore other options.",0,10
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 Summary: effective treatment of ADHD, awful if you have anxiety or BED/anorexia This was the first drug I took for ADHD. It was extremely effective. I was able to get all my work done in my classes with time management I had never had before. However, the side effects can be extreme. It made me extremely self conscious. I would apologize after virtually every sentence in a conversation because I was so scared something I did/said would be perceived as rude. I became obsessed with my skin and weight, developed severe dermatillomania and I lost about 35 pounds Vyvanse crash is awful. In the middle of the day as it would wear off I would suddenly become extremely agitated, snapping at people over something as small as the sound of their voice",0,24

Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 Vyvanse 60mg pros: laser focused, VERY social, upbeat, very confident, if you have ADHD you know what I mean when I say 'the fear' disappears. The fear when you think about your to-do list and the task of organizing and prioritizing and asking yourself whether or not you can do something. The fear of anticipation of that goes away. It's euphoric.  cons: VERY dry mouth, I had to get biotene, I am going to scale back to 30mg because 60mg really made me lose some of my inhibitions. I couldn't control what I was saying. I said things to friends I've known for 10 years that I have NEVER said, good + bad. Start with a lower dose. Make sure you don't use this drug for weight loss. It's tempting but it's disturbingly unhealthy and often times fat",0,19

It's like the the 12 hours it's supposed it last, more than half of it is just a really long come down.

Cleaned the walls cabinets and all the appliances. I was actually interested in cleaning and was able to keep cleaning for 10 hours without getting off track. The effects only lasted about 10 hours and I could tell when it was ending because my cravings for cigarettes started again. I only smoked about 2 cigarettes in that period. I binge eat if I don't smoke regularly so its great for quitting smoking along with focus for ADHD. Will be asking about this one.,0,21

I definitely have to put in the effort to experience the benefits; it's not motivation/focus-in-a-pill for me! The side effects I've experienced are increased anxiety, dry mouth, increased perfectionism, irritability, and some insomnia. Its impact on my mood varies.

I have a history with anxiety/depression and this medicine brings back some of those symptoms. Also, I tend to be a perfectionist when I take the medicine.

For an adult, I never thought ADD would be an issue. I finally saw my doctor who prescribed me Vyvanse. Vyvanse was the first pill I've ever taken for my ADD and it's seriously improved my life immensely.

Then I got Vyvance and its life changing, It doesn't feel like I'm on a prescription. It's more a tool that helps me get through everyday life. I'm much calmer, I can concentrate on one thing at the time. I get so much more done and I feel like I'm in peace with my mind.

As a full time university student and a single mother, I find it difficult to stay focused and keep up with my daily routine. I felt completely overwhelmed recently to the point I would procrastinate and nothing would get done. That in itself caused me anxiety.

He transitioned well to middle school and achieved great grades. However, he lost a lot of weight. About 15lbs. He had horrible insomnia. He slowly became very emotional and depressed in the afternoons and evenings. We decided to stop the medication.

It is an amazing drug to reduce distraction, calm the hyper/distractable me and just enjoy life a bit better. The only downside for me are two things:   firstly, the afternoon crash can suck.  I often am left feeling a little anxious or irritated. The other thing, and probably the more annoying side affect, is that is does impact my sleep.   To minimize these side affects, here are my tips that work for me: 1) stop drinking coffee or other stimulants. 1b) wait until you are properly awake before you take it...  2) don't drink on medication days. 3) schedule your diet and stick with it. 4) exercise in the morning (before taking it). 5) have your no medication / chill days.",0,31

While in the USA I found some mini brush on the go toothbrushes made by Colgate, called Wisp Max Fresh.  With dryness my teeth always feel like I have a film on them.

Now vyvanse has helped me so so much its just the getting the medication on time is what I struggle with, because I've noticed now that when I'm off vyvanse my ADHD is way worse like the anger and getting distracted part.

I take it mainly on work days and if off or on vacation I generally don't take it. On this blog it sounds like a lot users have other issues. Anyways this medication has worked wonders for me, makes me more sociable, happy and able to continue concentrate. I work as an engineer.

Using 60mg most of the year, but 30mg in summers, since I don't need that much when there is no requirements to what I need to get done.

I was expecting a 'non event' transition, from adderall, to  Dexedrine predominant Vyvanse. I have used Dexedrine and found it helpful with focus and follow through issues, with minimal side effects. Vyvanse did not turn out to be what I'd hoped for. Minimal fuss, and a stable continuation of living and treating my ADD. Vyvanse Had no similarities to Dexedrine . Felt sad, bad, and disconnected from being in the moment. Side effects did not disappear during course of treatment.

Trying to get off it it brought about terrible withdrawal symptoms; I gained a lot of weight, was lifeless, and extremely depressed.  I really wish I never started this drug.

If you don't eat and drink water you gonna feel bad, remember that. I recommend to take magnesium if you feel tension in your body  and vitamine c before you going to sleep ( it makes that medicine goes away faster from your body).

Like other patients I experienced the need to increase dosage as the effects weakened. I got up to 75mg and eventually backed down to 50mg as it was interfering with my sleep. However, unlike others this dosage has been sufficient for 4 or 5 years.

Nothing makes you happy, but at the same time,  nothing can make you sad.    Whereas with the Amphetamines (like Adderall and lesser extent Vyvanse) you become an extremely emotional, almost volatile, person who can experience pleasures in an extreme way. You get so overjoyed by the little things but the smallest of pet peeves can really set you off.  Vyvanse has been the best one for me.

Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and I was first prescribed Concerta. Since Concerta is part instant release and part extended release it starts working extremely quick, within 15-30 minutes, which was nice because there was no need to time things out when taking the medication. Unfortunately, Concerta starts working immediately and also stops working immediately which for me led a horrific crash. I was irritable and angry after the medication wore off. Due to this my doctor switched me to Vyvanse. Vyvanse is a prodrug which means the actual drug inside the capsule is not therapeutically helpful until it gets broken down in the body. This allows for a nice steady come up and no crash when the medication is eventually excreted.",0,30

I have taken up to 60 mg but I went through time periods where I would withdrawal myself from it and start back up again at 30 mg. The 30mg is way more manageable than any other dose I think.

I does not matter how much Vyvanse you take, your body will not let the amphetamine level go any higher than it can process it. This gives you control. Vyvanse is a spark, it lets you chose what to focus on, rather than make you hyper and euphoric like other ADHD meds do. Why it does not work for some people? Because most people fail to use ADHD meds accordingly! No med is a magic bullet.

Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 This medication has changed my life. I didn't start taking it until I was 24 years old. I honestly thought it was hopeless trying to figure out my life. I kept failing college courses, struggled with my job, struggled with relationships. I genuinely thought I was stupid. Sounds dramatic, but that's honestly I how I felt. I just couldn't think or concentrate. Then I tried Vyvanse. I was really against stimulants or any type of drug that could be addictive. But, I'm SO grateful I tried it. I wouldn't be where I am today without it. I'm a nursing student with a 4.0. I have an amazing relationship and I enjoy my job. It's not a miracle drug, but it really helps me focus and do the things I know I can do. Definitely recommend it.",0,71
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I was officially diagnosed with ADHD around age 28 but it wasn't until 30 that I decided to try medication. I started with Vyvanse. Holy crap! It was amazing. I hadn't realized how much noise went on in my head until it was quiet. Then I could have linear thought patterns. For the first time ever my life started to come together. I could see tasks in processes, I could think clearly, I could manage my emotions. It was amazing. Then the side effects kicked in. My dr and I went through every other adhd medication there was and nothing helped. I did more research and found that my problem was that all of the medications use dyes which gave me flu like symptoms. Vyvanse uses the most dyes so made me the sickest. I now take it out of capsule.",0,53
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I have suffered from ADD/ADHD for all my life. I am currently 23 years old. I was on vyvanse (40 mgs, I am extremely sensitive to pills).

I got Mono, and had to stop the medicine while my body recovered. I really liked the way i felt off it. But i now feel as though my life is unmanageable. I don't like the feeling of being medicated so young with out any proof of long term effects, but i feel like i am drowning. I feel alone in my ADHD because its not something that people feel sympathetic toward. Vyvanse really changed that feeling.",0,36

I don't notice any side effects. Hasn't effected sleep. I take at about 6:30 AM and it wears off by afternoon. It is pretty expensive because insurance doesn't cover and have to visit Dr. every month. If you are older and in good health and have ADD symptoms I suggest you look into this. Your body adjusts to it over the first couple months. The first time you take it you feel euphoric but that is not what you want. Keep taking small dose.",0,37

I also become extremely irritable, anxious, and restless.

My therapist rx'd Kapvay with it to help with irritability and quick reactions to situations.

I dropped the Kapvay and it has helped with the teeth but I'm now dealing with several cavities to get filled.

It go so bad at 40mg that I thought the mafia was coming to get me, but in reality it was just a car driving in front of my house. This drug ended up with me being sedated by the cops, and being placed in the psychiatric ward for a month. The withdrawals I got from this drug were horrible, I imagine it's what it's like to quit a harder recreational drug. I know this drug works great for some people, but not for everyone.

Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 Vyvanse is hands down, in my opinion, the best ADHD medication out there. I was on Concerta from the ages of 7-13, then again from 20-21. I received genetic testing and it came back that my body doesn't metabolize Concerta very well. So the doctor gave me Adderall, which was too harsh with the come up and come down. Then made the switch to Vyvanse. Best decision.  #1. You don't crash when you are on it. It has the smoothest come up and come down compared to Adderall and Concerta.  #2. Vyvanse lasts a good 10-14 hours in the body  #3. It has the longest duration of action #4. It has low addiction potential  #5.

He tried various meds but all had side effects. By 7th grade, he refused to take meds.  We moved him to a Charter School for kids with different learning styles. It was a good school but he was furious over being placed there and refused to go.  He struggled all through high school getting mostly C's and D's even with accommodations.

Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I have taken Adderall XR and Vyvanse. They both have a similar but not completely similar feeling when it comes to getting work done. But mainly my experience with Vyvance is quite good but not great. I take whenever I get up to go to school (6-6:30), and it takes an hour to kick in. I have been taking Vyvance for the last 4 years. It helps you focus a lot more than usual and it gives you the motivation to get work done. But the downside about it is that you feel depressed for a minute or anxiety, but after a couple of minutes you feel back motivated and happy. Also, I love that it gives you the mind clarity that I personally think everyone needs. Overall, my experience with Vyvance Is awesome. Btw I'm 15",0,65

Sometimes its cleaning or sometimes its researching a very unimportant subject online.,0,25
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I have suffered with BED and bulimia for over 5 years and after feeling like I tried everything to control my eating, including spending hundreds of dollars on therapy, I discovered Vyvanse. I was very reluctant to try it as I did not want to become dependant on any type of medication, but I was at my wits end with my eating disorder. My Dr started me off with the smallest dose(30mg) and after taking the pill each morning I did not feel much different at all. But I gradually worked my way up to the highest dose(70mg) and I could not be happier with the impact it is making on my life. Food is something I no longer 'love' and then 'hate'. I now have a healthy relationship with food and it no longer controls my life. Sure I still over eat and crave junky food sometimes, but there's nothing wrong with that... I am human. The only downfalls for me is that if I don't take it early enough in the day it keeps me awake at night(effects last approx. 13hrs) and I can no longer smoke weed or drink coffee as Vyvanse gives me a touch of anxiety. I realize that Vyvanse could possibly only be a temporary fix for me, but now that my mind is not ALWAYS on food I have been able to focus on controlling my emotions that trigger my eating disorder. I am not giving it a 10 only because it does give me anxiety and is extremely expensive! Thanks for reading.",0,43

I am an avid runner and I run 3 to 5 miles everyday ever since I was 16, now I am 30 years old. I am also a serious health  conscious person. I know that this drug is to be metabolized in your liver before becoming active but I feel like this medication  goes through me too fast, like drinking water!

So far I lost 4pds. It's been almost a week. I don't get any feeling of jitters, or that I'm taking speed. I feel normal, I just want to do stuff. I'm more social.

And  in college when I take it, especially on my days off, I get a lot of work done. I am not a very talkative person, but it made me feel like having nice conversations with people. In mid day, I am in a great mood, but sometimes it goes away every now and then. I dont feel like eating almost all day, but Its smart to eat breakfast before hand, and then dinner.

This medicine made me feel like i could actually sit in class with out falling asleep or not being able to concentrate. It's a great feeling to actually get everything done. Yes it does cause dry mouth and you may not eat like you used to. However you have to make yourself eat something other wise you can cause your blood sugar to drop witch would cause headach and nausea. With time you do get used to the medicine and you will get your appitite back. I'm on 50mg. On days i dont take it im like a walking zombie i dont feel like doing anything i cant concentrate and i will most likely eat all day long. I'm more activie when i do take it! I love it !,0,43

I read lots of reviews how it makes you feel high and super active. I felt a little bit of a buzz but not high. It was just a pleasant feeling of happiness. I'm sure it's different for everyone, but mine wasn't extreme. I also felt like I had more energy, but not enough to obsessively clean my house like others that left reviews.  Definitely take it early. It will keep you up otherwise. Only complaint so far!",0,41

The only negative is if I don't take it for a day or 2 on the weekends then start again is at first it makes me real jittery and makes me go to the bathroom until my bowels are essentially cleaned out, but that's really not a bad thing. Also I love the way it curbs my appetite and keeps me around 115 lbs without even trying(I'm 5'3). A very pleasant side effect!!

Yes, it suppresses the appetite a little, and sometimes I have to force myself to eat.  This medication doesn't alter my personality oddly like Adderall. I'm still me, just more focused.

So it's tough even for the doctors to tell if it's from the asthma or the Vyvanse! The ER doc said no, Vyvanse shouldn't cause chest pains, so did my psychiatrist (who I trust and really respect).

There was this short period of time that I took a break every now and then, do not do that! It made me chronically bipolar but I've started up on it and it really is the best medication you could have. If you wish to get off of it, I suggest you do so slowly and on days you don't have it, drink caffeine.

But there is no crash and is incredibly smooth compared to IR Adderall, Focalin or Ritalin.

The crash is relatively mild. Previously I have been on dexamphetamine IR 3x10mg/day for one month which worked really well, but I wanted something that is sustained released. Before that I was on Ritalin IR and LA for over 15 years. The Methylphenidate just did not work as well as it used to and I found the side effects more and more unpleasant.

Which could turn into a bad thing with weight gain. Normally can't fall asleep till around 2-3am every night.

His teacher and I filled out the normal forms which ask how unfocused rating 1-5 etc. and our answers were near identical. His doctor saw the info and sure enough, an ADHD diagnosis.

Lisdexamfetamine,I have been taking lisdexamfetamine since end of May 2013 but for weight loss. I noticed during a 10 day period I had to go off of lisdexamfetamine how much it helped me focus and function. I completed daily tasks and projects I even went back to finish college. I learned through this that I have ADHD I never knew this before. I knew of learning disabilities and vision problems from grade school no one ever tested or diagnosed me with ADHD/ADD until now and I am mid 40's basically started life over again now. I have noticed that I do feel the medication wearing off starting about 2-3pm but more of the energy part of medication I seem to still be able to focus most days. I started a vitamin supplements in the afternoons now.,10,1

As an adult I learned many organizational skills, but continued to struggle terribly with lack of motivation, focus &amp; enjoyment in life, despite living in abundant material comfort. When I started taking 30mg of this a day at my doctor's urging, it was as if a bright light flooded what had previously only been utter darkness in my brain for 30  years.

I was bummed about that because I really liked them. Great for those who want a stimulant that gradually wears off.,0,34

I'm normally a really happy, easy going person, do not get mad easily AT ALL, but on the Strattera, I was moody and was having nightmares, couldn't sleep. So he put me on Ritalin. It was the same as the Strattera, moody, nightmares, and the added increased heart rate. So finally, the Dr said he was going to try Vyvanse.

So we went and got tested and I had a lot of tests done on me and my brain, actually.. And the hypothalamus in my brain was not working correctly and was not sending many signals to my nervous system.. And that was the cause of ADD.. My doctor then prescribed my Vyvanse and the first day I was on it I was overly concentrated and very mixed up... My eyes felt huge and I felt like I was tripping to be honest..

Sleeping is tough because it's a stimulant so I was put on sleep meds to help. You might have a jittery feeling and increased heart rate at first. It takes about an hour or so to kick in but it's a fantastic medicine. It's also very powerful. All you gotta do is NOT take it past 2pm at absolute LATEST or you'll lie awake forever in bed.

My focus and concentration has improved greatly and so has my quality of life.   The only drawbacks are that I've noticed a decreased appetite and usually it takes an hour or two to kick in.  I don't take it on weekends to help avoid developing a tolerance (this was per my physician's advice) and I seem to be restless at night on days when I don't take it.

All her doctors have done is increased her dosage, paired it up with Intuniv, and now have her on a mood stabilizer.  We are waiting to see how this all goes.

At night I got about an hour of sleep then was up for about 8 hours until it was time to go to school and I forgot to eat the whole day it's just food didn't sound good at all and it gave me so much energy especially because we had to run the mile at school and I ran it very fast because it changes your whole mindset.,0,26

I was so reluctant to start him on any type of medicine, but his inability to focus, keep his hands to himself, stay in his seat at school, etc., was affecting the learning of his classmates and causing him to have a hard time making friends. I saw a difference in him (and his teacher did, too), immediately after the 1st dose, he was able to focus, was making friends, etc. I have decided to try him on something different because he's losing weight and he's not the happy, sweet boy that I know he is. He's moody, he gets upset extremely easily, he's grumpy, and is SUPER serious about everything, he finds nothing funny. Its definitely altered his personality, even off the meds.",0,68

Although it worked in a fashion similar to Adderall, I feel as if I have better control taking the medicine 3 x a day. The Vyvanse would wear off and then come back and start to work again and I found it disconcerting; it was like a roller coaster.

Not only did I actually WANT to take it, Vyvanse compelled me to ace my schoolwork, resulting in consistent grades of 95  (the only downside being that it induced OCD behavior.) However, while I started at 40mg, I steadily increased to 70mg (max dose) by the end of 10th grade.

I've been on Vyvanse for over a year now under the direction of a new doctor/addiction specialist and this medication has CHANGED MY LIFE.

I was hesitant to continue to try another stimulant because I was actually diagnosed with anxiety (by my psychiatrist) and mild depression and the stimulants seemed to heighten these symptoms.

Very important to take it at 7am everyday. May want to hold off on weekends unless there is need to focus for study. Consider counseling to help stay on track and educate client and family regarding the fact that ADHD is a gift of creativity and out of the box thinking.,0,85

He did experience a few side effects such as headaches and nausea the first few days, but those have passed. Most important, he is still my son, no zombies.

It was weird because I felt more over-stimulated Adderall type buzz/high feeling at 20 and 30mgs. I liked that feeling but I was having side effects like lack of sleep. I actually then upped my dose to 50mgs. Around that time I was holding 2 jobs and studying full time, 6 college classes.

I am currently on 100 mg of Vyvanse combined with 300mg of Wellbrutin and am definitely more alert and able to focus more during the workday. However I have severe bouts of nausea, loss of appetite and weight (not unwelcome).  The medicine wears off by the evening so insomnia is not an issue.  I don't like price of the drug (even after my drug plan) and after discussing with my doctor I was asked to pop a 60 mg pill in the morning and a 40 mg a couple of hours later.  I will see if that helps my nausea.",0,11

I have to focus on what I'm saying to make less grammar mistakes and sometimes I do sound slow. Vyvanse has enhanced my comprehension: I can now do math quicker, enjoy reading and listening, and actually talk like a normal person. I feel happy and energetic.  Sounds too good to be true, but I consider myself lucky. No adverse side effects yet.",0,28

I can finally read a book and know what I read or do my homework on my own! Since this medication; I stopped making stupid choices, went from D's to all B's. It helped my depression and it changed my life dramatically. My relationship with my friends and family has grown stronger.

After 2 months of taking 30mg x2 a day I'm tired a lot and seemed to have already built up a resistance to it. Maybe I just need to increase the dose, not sure. This medicine worked great at first for ADHD and I'm hoping I can increase the dose and feel energetic and focused again.

The statement you don't know what you don't know rings so true for me.  Immediately upon starting this prescription my world changed.  I was able to fully complete tasks, stay on schedule, CONCENTRATE, and prioritize...the list goes on and on.  I wish I had a before and after photo of my home.

I got diagnosed with ADHD, tried Strattera, tried Concerta to no effect. New doctor suggested Vyvanse, I started at a 30 mg, I'm up to 70 mg a day but have been steady on that dose for at least a year. It has decreased my appetite, but I also started p90x not long after I started taking this drug so I'm not sure which is more responsible for my weight loss.

The last year in college Adderall made me anxious, suspicious, and generally unhappy. So after several trials with Ritalin and Cymbalta, I am proud to say that I am doing much better on Vyvanse and my grades were awesome this semester. Two A's, two B's and a C! Much better than two B's and three C's.  I am on 40mg of Vyvanse. I did lose 20lbs during the first two months but I gained it back. I also do have some trouble eating in the afternoons but when the medicine wears off, which I never notice haha, I am able to eat quite a bit of food. Overall, Vyvanse is an amazing choice.",0,3

My son is the sweetest, kindest kid and wanted to please everyone (teachers, parents, etc).  However, he struggled so much with academics and general life organization.  Homework time was a nightmare. By the time he was in 4th grade I broke down and took him to a doctor to try medications because something HAD to change. Vyvance has changed his life for the better. All of his grades went up in a matter of weeks, his homework is completed correctly and neatly before I even get home, and he will even tell you he feels better in general.  He also tried Adderrall but that just made him very hostile.",0,19

I went off the pills in grade 7 due to mental and physical health issues and concerns. Decided to take the pills again because I need them to graduate, started on Vyvasne.

Although those medications were effective, Vyvanse has greatly out performed both.  The most significant side effect has been lack of appetite.  We encourage a late meal so that he can make up for what he has missed throughout the day.  His weight seems to be holding steady following an initial weight loss of 6 pounds.  This is a medication worth trying!",0,5
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 My son is 13 and has been on several ADHD medications.  I liked the Vyvance at first because I did see an improvement in his ability to sit and listen and pay attention, however it didn't last long enough.  The doctor has increased the dosage several time and now he is up to 60mg daily. The problem is that he has lost over 20lbs because he simply won't eat and now it seems after four months on this medicine its like his body has adapted to it and he is super hyper.  I spoke to the doctor about it and he said he can do real damage at his age with the weight loss and not eating and that the stimulant is actually wiring him up.  We are going to take him off of the Vyvanse and put him on a non stimulant medication.",0,4

I was diagnosed with ADHD last year and was on a different medication that really didn't work and then a month ago my doctor prescribed Vyvanse and it has changed my life so much. I recommend that every person with  ADHD try it out. Its amazing. The only real side effect I have is I'm a little more irritable.,0,3
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I was diagnosed with ADHD in the middle of my 9th grade year. My parents noticed I have failed more classes than passed the past years. It turns out I have ADHD, I was started off on 50mg which automatically kept me calm, quiet and eager to pay attention and learn. I passed all my classes my 9th grade year. Currently, I'm almost complete with 10th grade. I am passing everything and doing an excellent job keeping up with school, homework and my job. I've gone from 50mg to 70mg. I didn't think I could feel the need to take this so much. When I don't take it, I can't hold my eyes open. I binge eat in bed, half asleep. But this does keep your mind off hunger, I went from 190lbs to 125lbs in a year.",0,11
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 My son was on Vyvanse for 3 years. At first the side effects were the normal irritability, obsessive thoughts and anxiety only on the days he took the drug. His concentration and grades improved so the benefits outweighed the side effects. The last year though he was increasingly negative, obsessing over negative thoughts, anxious and paranoid only on the days he took it. I think the side effects can affect kids more or less as they grow. He was very depressed for a 10 year old. Since he's been off he's been happier!! I think positive thoughts are more important than grades since we all know where negative thoughts leads to down the road if left unchecked. Overall the medicine is not bad but keep a close eye on behavior.",0,17

My doctor switched me to 70 mg of Vyvanse (started out at 70mg since I had been on a high dose of Ritalin for so long), and it was like magic!  I started getting all A's and became more productive at work. The only bad things about the medicine are some of the side effects. I've noticed that gum helps with the dry mouth compared to just drinking water. Suffer from anxiety and insomnia now but take Celexa for anxiety and Ambien for insomnia. But all is good.",0,4
Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 It helps a lot with paying attention, On 30mg once a day and it works up until about 7th-8th hour (5 hours after taking it) and for me suppresses my appetite so I don't care if I eat or not.

Lisdexamfetamine,<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 This medication has changed my life. I've always tested very well but never was able to do mundane tasks. My teachers were always mad that I got Fs but made perfect scores on state tests since I was a kid. I was diagnosed ADHD last year. Concerta didn't work unless I soaked it in hot water and bit it in half. Adderall made me a complete genius and all I did was study and read. But I guess I was really mean to people and I got anger problems and paranoia. Vyvanse makes me feel like I'm on top of everything and that I can do something with my life. I care about my future and I haven't cut myself in over a year. It has helped with my depression that was caused by the ADHD.,0,25

I am usually a bright bubbly person and don't take anything too personal. After a week of this medicine (40 mg) I noticed I'm snapping at people over absolutely nothing. I feel like I've become bipolar, one moment I'll  be beyond happy and focused, the next irritated, then angry. Then crying over nothing. I've become mouthy to my instructors and don't like long conversations anymore. People seem to irritate me and there's only a few that I can stand being around for a long period of time.

However, around September 2010 I ran out and the doctor couldn't see me until december (I know, it's crazy). Of course, I couldn't concentrate as well but my mood improved considerably, I was actually happy. I started taking it again in January and on the second day, I saw an ex-girlfriend that I still really liked and I almost broke down in tears.

Anyway I went to the Doctor and after all my research I asked the doc (I am a nurse by the way) if we could try Vyvanse and he said yes, that is after he determined that Yes he has ADHD. The first week back at school (after break) the teachers could not believe the change in him.

At the end of my rope at 7 am I paged his doctor.  We lowered the dose to 15 mg. He seemed initially to do better on the 15mg and was doing well in school.  He became more aggressive and started having OCD behaviors of constantly washing his hands (I counted 30 times in an hour) and crying and staying up all night.  Last night he stayed up until 4:30 am and I was at my wits end. So today his doctor is switching him to another medication but we may try it in a combination.,0,13

Well, turns out that you just get a really strange night's sleep and an awful stomach ache for a day with your fair share of vomiting.

I am irritable every now and then, but before I was very frustrated with everyday activities. It gives me energy for the most part. I'm not shaky or nervous like I was on Adderall XR.

I am a successful professional that always had to work a little harder to achieve results due to my lack of concentration and tendency toward distractions.  I started taking Vyvanse, and have to admit I felt like Superwoman for about a week and ranted and raved about how much I was getting done without the jittery feeling most stimulants provide.  But then all in one day, I crashed.  I started getting extremely agitated.  I then would get so angry I would cry hysterically.  I quit taking the medication and within a few days my mood and attitude have leveled off.  Although, I have suffered from extreme vertigo and exhaustion since I have been off this medicine.

Finally, after a couple years of a break from the medications (nothing worked before), my new doctor decided to put me on Vyvanse (30mg).  Within the first few hours of taking this drug, I noticed improvement. My mind didn't feel clouded, I could remember things, I could finish tasks, and I was not easily distracted like before. He added Depakote(125mg) to my regimen, which is supposed to assist with agitation and anxiety. Together, these drugs have tremendously improved my life.

I stayed focused, and if I started an assignment I finished it but he gave me a script for 1 a day every morning but I found myself taking 2 a day sometimes so he gave me the 60mg Vyvanse.

It helps me get my work done and it helps me stay in control and very focused all day long while I'm working. Before I started taking Vyvanse I couldn't concentrate what so ever. And I would never get my work done. It also makes me feel the best that I have ever felt in my whole life. If it wasn't for Vyvanse I would probably be fired. I'm 24 and I finally get to enjoy life.

He has been on up to 70 mg of Vyvanse for a year now and I am thinking of switching him to a different medication. Vyvanse does take care of his hyperactivity but, the lack of attention and defiance is still there.  Also, the medication takes 90 minutes to kick in.

She was really small, and we almost had to take her off the medicine, but she eventually started gaining weight. She is still very small, but her weight is healthy.

I didn't know what it was like to be normal prior to this medicine. The only issue I have is the stomach problems. Some slight stomach pain and bowel issues. I also stopped drinking caffeine and have adjusted my diet to be more well balanced. It's helped a lot. If you're new to Vyvanse, don't drink caffeine!

It worries me because my son is usually happy go lucky all the time and with this medicine he is VERY EASILY upset, not himself at all. SO PLEASE BE AWARE OF EVERYTHING YOUR CHILD DOES OR ACTS WHILE TAKING THIS MEDICATION.",0,205

First was prescribed Adderall, but I found that even the slow-release capsule wore off quickly, leaving me exhausted and crashing at work, scarfing down cups of coffee. My doctor switched me by Vyvanse, and it's been much, much better. I am better able to focus, it lasts longer. However, it still doesn't get me through the whole day and I find I'm extremely tired at night. Also, sometimes I get caught up in the trivial details of both work and home projects. But on the whole, I am FAR better off since I began Vyvanse. I wish that 70mg was not the highest recommended amount, but I stick to it.",0,31

This seems to work much better and also does not affect her personality like Adderall.   She has some loss of appetite but not as bad.   Yesterday I forgot to give the medication to her and she had a severe crying spell last night and did not know why.  I believe she may have been experiencing withdrawal symptoms.  She is taking 40 mg.   I may switch back to 30mg.  Be aware that you may not be able to stop this medication abruptly if on it for a long time.,0,44

My doctor and I were discussing it last night and he said that not everyone has the success that I've had on it...everyone is different. I take 70mg and it does last all day. No bad side effects except I've lost 15lbs, so I must watch that. Also..dry mouth. Otherwise, Vyvanse gets the highest marks with me.

I made high honors and was like smart for the first time. I was capable of being focused of what was only going on in the classroom and didn't have to worry about anything besides school.

Then I switched to Vyvanse which worked about the same as the Adderall but I wasn't as irritable and didn't have the same loss of appetite.

I don't know if I have to increase my dose but am unsure because of heart issues it causes. Pros: Helps with organization, I am excited about things for the first time when I was a teenager.

The medicine made me totally not eat and run around like I was on drugs and couldn't sit still. I became so skinny I could see all of my ribs. I also felt like I had lost all emotions and the relationship with my parents were harmed because of this. I think part of the problem was the doctor just upping my dose whenever he felt like it and not being very responsible. But I just want to warn anyone who is thinking about taking Vyvanse to be careful and have a doctor who cares.",0,56

Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 Works better than Concerta for ADHD-IA for attentiveness as well as alertness. Far superior to Concerta in regards to affecting sleep. Vyvanse doesn't keep you awake. Also seems to contrast greatly to Concerta's method of dealing with attentiveness. Makes a less zombie-like state of concentration and lets you break task when needed. An added effect is that of a more positive sense of well-being; most likely attributed to its amphetamine-based nature. The greatest advantage is the delayed release into the body. Great for those whose metabolisms don't react well to Adderall XR or Concerta. Only wished it lasted about two hours longer in the body, but adapting dose time is acceptable.",0,45

I can finally pay attention in class and actually absorb the information. I feel energized, motivated, and more organized to do things.

Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I'm 51-years old and was skeptical regarding ADD or ADHD. A counselor urged me to get tested. I agreed to do it because all I wanted was help. I no longer cared what the answer was for whatever was wrong. I only cared if it worked. So, I did the test and was told I was off the charts the highest scores they had seen in years of testing. Today I take 120-150 mgs of Vyvanse daily and it makes a difference. Nonetheless, even though Vyvanse has been very helpful, I still doubted whether ADHD was real. I couldn't understand why the medicine was so highly regulated. How could anyone get addicted to this stuff I thought? Then I realized people like me don't get high from drugs like this and that's one reason I know it's working and ADHD is real.",0,132

I could immediately tell a huge difference in my mood, concentration, focus and general outlook on life. My anxiety was decreased tremendously as well. As the month went on I started to notice that the Focalin was very hot and cold. Some days I would feel on top of the world and other days it didn't seem to work at all.

I am much more talkative, been in a better mood, less lazy, and I actually don't mind cleaning my room every now and then. I used to fight with my boyfriend all the time about things, which I now realize should have been no big deal at all. But now, things have changed. I'm excited for school, even because I want to see if Vyvanse will help me bring up my grades and concentrate better, instead of falling asleep in class. Some side effects I've noticed though is not having an appetite, and talking too much.",0,22

Lisdexamfetamine,"<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I started using this medication about 4 months ago. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 5 years old. The only annoying thing about this medication is that it keeps my mouth extremely dry. I found that using hard candies (regular or sugar free) helps a lot. Vyvanse has helped me a lot, especially with my concentration. I can actually read a book without having to read the same page 3 times, but the only thing is that it feels like my blood pressure goes up, I also have tachycardia.",0,18

Honestly, I love this medication, as it has helped me in almost every aspect of life.  My grades as well as my confidence in social situations are better than ever.  The only slightly annoying side effect that hasn't gone away is that I find my mouth sometimes getting extremely dry.

The one issue I did encounter was an increase to my already existent problem with insomnia but having started taking Trazodone has counteracted this issue. It should be noted that not everyone has the same reaction to any given drug but as for me, nothing I've tried in the past has been NEAR as effective.

My daughter made a complete turn-around! Happy in the morning, soaring at school, and even sleeping well at night! In a month after starting Vyvanse, she was awarded student of the month, by the end of school she was most improved student of the year.

I really started to like the medication: more focus, motivation.  I have worked my way up to 50mg.  After a couple of weeks on each dose, the medication doesn't last the whole 12 hours.

For years I had been taking Concerta but I felt like it didn't do much for me. My grades started slipping during my sophmore year in high school and I decided that enough was enough. So I did some research and started reading about Vyvanse. My doctor didn't know much about it because it is a fairly new drug. I started taking 50mg of Vyvanse when I was 18 and have seen nothing but positive effects. I went from a 3.0 to a 4.1 GPA.

The eupohric feeling Adderall produces brings a high potential for abuse and dependence, along with extreme mood changes and irratability. With Vyvanse, the urge for more does not exist. It is consistent throughout most of the day and delivers concentration and a sense of confidence and well-being. I've had slightly decreased appetite, but am much more productive and focused.

I started doing research and finding out what my options were. I found the Vyvanse by accident and I had to find out more. What I read was so amazing I wanted it for my son. I couldn't believe how hard it was to get the Doctors to understand I knew what I was doing and I was going to do whatever it took to get my son the proper help.

The only thing that I can say is that my son said that he doesn't want to eat as much but he eats anyway because he knows he needs to and at night he wakes up once.

I switched to Focalin XR and it worked well for maybe another month before the same thing started happening. My doctor then wanted to try one more time so he said there is a newer stimulant out for ADD/ADHD and it is pretty much like a cousin of Adderall. He said there is a better chance that this won't have a negative rebound. I have been on 60mg of Vyvanse for a few months and I have not felt any type of negative side-effects like I had before.

I resisted not knowing much about ADHD.  They tried him on a couple of different medicines (without success) before we tried Vyvanse the first dose 30mg did show a vast improvement but it didn't last long. We increased the doses several times before reaching his current dose of 60mg.  Like the others have stated he has loss of appetite and trouble going to sleep. They continually monitor his weight and take blood samples to make sure there is no harm to liver and kidneys. He still has occasional meltdowns which we have learned to recognize.

Lisdexamfetamine,<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 Absolute MIRACLE pill. I am 17 and take Vyvanse. I went from being sleeping in class F student to being more focused and motivated to do my work and now my F's are A's and B's. It also made me so much more social and happy. One bad thing is that I do have trouble sleeping and that's really the only bad thing about this drug. It also causes decrease in appetite and weight loss.,0,31

No longer feel jittery, no funny taste, but my mouth is always dry so I drink a lot of water. Vyvanse seems to help me get more done.  I can't say I'm more focused, but I am more motivated, so the end result is more productivity, though not always directed in the best place. It decreased my appetite, so it was easier to switch to a healthier diet.  Lost more than 25 lbs. in first 3 months, which has also helped increase self esteem, motivation and energy level.",0,155

Vyvanse seemed to work good in the mornings but wore off around 1pm. I took it around 7:30am. The medication really depends on what you eat. 12 hours is not true for me. I don't know about you but I don't have time to make sure I eat this type of food for dinner and this type for breakfast just so my my medicines will work.

By switching him to 20 mg he is able to maintain his junior high honors classes and be functionable and focused. By going down to the 20 mg he is able to have a personality and yet not be flicking and annoying people.  Without the medicine he was unable to stay seated at the piano to practice and now he is proficient and can practice on his own without me telling him to sit down every 3 minutes.

Also, I can't feel when it starts working and stops working - which is great. It wears off slowly starting about 7-8 hours after I take it. After 10-11 hours I do not feel it in my system anymore. No Insomnia or crashing feeling. Weight loss (ok since I am fat) about 25 lbs in 3 months. My only complaint is it makes me want to smoke. I quit smoking a long time ago.
