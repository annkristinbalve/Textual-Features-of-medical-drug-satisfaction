Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Ive only been on it for 3 days, I get so tired the first few hours until I try to actually go to sleep then Im restless, cant stop moving. Overheating with chills, and I feel sick the whole time Im on it. Nausea and headaches are very bad, consistently thirsty, and body aches! I dont know if this is normal starting out, I know that some medications make you feel sick at first but this is unbearable.",0,2
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Vraylar is a terrible drug. Gave me akasthia and made me really tired, felt like I couldnt think. Withdrawal symptoms are worse, I feel terrible and nauseous",0,2
Cariprazine,This drug cariprazine has changed my life entirely. I was on so many other medications before this and nothing worked. I was constantly crumbling and fighting suicidal thoughts and ideation. Since being on Vraylar I feel my emotions are so level and stable. I feel so calm and my mind is quiet. It brings me to tears thinking about it. Im beyond grateful for this medication as I feel it saved my life.,10,4
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I was prescribed this Vraylar for bipolar 2, mainly depression. I have been on it for a few weeks and I think this is the one that will change my life. I have a good level of mental energy for the first time ever (but not wired, like a stimulant), I suddenly have no problem motivating myself to do the things I want to do, I dont have the urge to overeat, and I am a happier, more cheerful person. I have had none of the extra pyramidal or cognitive side effects, but it did make me a little bit hypomanic at first and has made my sleep very fragmented, so I have had to take Saphris some nights to bring me down and help me sleep. All of the bad reviews and potential side effects made me scared to try it for a while, after having had a bad experience with another atypical antipsychotic, but the benefits have far outweighed any mild side effects Ive experienced.",0,37
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 This is the worst medicine I have ever taken. It actually made my manic and compulsive buying worse. It messed with my sleep schedule and my blood sugar. Im normally 103-105 lbs. I was constantly hungry on this and my blood sugar would plummet between meals. I gained 7 lbs in 2 months after my doc put me on 3mg. I have switched to lithium and feel like a new person.,0,12
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Ive been on Vraylar for about 4 weeks. First few days I was really tired, day 4 I felt better, improved mood. Then I started to get cognitive impairment. Couldnt keep up with conversations, could hardly string a sentence together. My doctor wanted to increase to 3mg, so I did. Depression got a lot better, but had anxiety attacks, and fidgeting, restlessness, didnt find any pleasure in watching TV, couldnt concentrate. Could barely work cos I couldnt concentrate or talk to people. I have weaned off 3mg to 1.5mg, but it wasnt easy. Now I dont know if Ive got the courage to completely stop, I know depression will kick in. Any thoughts?",0,16
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I took two weeks of samples and started on week three when the side effects seriously started. First major hot flashes. Then the over eating and always thirsty. Then I started noticing I was constantly moving. I could not sit or stand still. My feet, my hands and hyperactivity. I also was constantly talking and over talking people. I couldn't wait. Everything had to be now. I stopped taking it and after two days was feeling much better. I have taken other medications and this was one of the worst.",0,13
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I was on it for about two weeks after switching from trileptal to treat my bipolar. I was on both trileptal and vraylar at the time. The vraylar made me feel suicidal and all around horrible. I would not recommend it. It only helped initially during the first couple of days like during the first 3 days.,0,6
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I do not really like how this drug made me feel. It did not do much for my depression. It has a lot of side effects and just made me very sleepy. Most likely won't take again!,0,9
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I have bipolar 1 and have been taking 3 mg of Vraylar w 200mg of Seroquel.  Im in heaven.  No more irritability. I sleep (thanks to the Seroquel).  No side effects.  I love it.  Im a normal person.  I can work.   Ive been on this mix for over three years.,0,26
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I have been dealing with bipolar for 20 years and this med is by far the worst. Started on 1.5 mg 3 x week and then to every other day.It spiralled me into the worse mania I have ever had .Was awake for 4 days straight .,0,13
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I just started taking Vyraylar and so far so good. I will see how it's going in a few weeks. No more high's and low's I like it so far.,0,7
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I started to help me the 2nd day I took Vraylar (  have bipolar) . It keeps me from hitting the low - lows. However,  I can no longer sleep more than 4 hours at a time. It's great as a mood stabilizer but not sleeping is starting to get to me. Is this normal?",0,14
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I must say.  15 years bipolar with a personality disorder and extreme anxiety.  I am on many medications for many things.  Vraylar has been WONDERFUL.  The first week was the worst week ever.  The sweating, I couldn't sit still at all, and I thought I was losing it... I made it to week two and all of that went away.  It was tough.  I still can't sit still well and get bored of things way faster then usual. I don't even care for my TV shows anymore... too hard to sit through.  However, the benefits FAR outweigh the cons.  Give it more then one week for sure...",0,26
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I love vraylar I feel amazing on it. Im totally stabilized but the issue I have is ever since I started taking it I havent had a period. And Im not sure if this is a side effect of the vraylar. Been to the gyno and everything is fine via blood work and uterine biopsy. So I dont know maybe something to look out for.,0,13
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Vraylar was the first drug I have ever used to treat my bipolar. I was scared out of my mind, but I finally took it. There were side effects the first few weeks that tapered off. I am in ongoing therapy which I think is really important.  Bottom line I am really glad I got over my fears and took it. I'm no longer depressed but I am feeling things now after a long time. Laughing more, yelling more, getting mad, and being more productive. I was depressed for a long time. I feel like I'm at the beginning of getting my life back. I was very concerned about weight gain so I work out every day .. at least thirty minutes of walking or going to the gym. I got really hungry so I joined weight watchers to track my food intake and get advice. I eat a ton of fruit and drink water all day. It's forcing me to be healthy. I have lost weight and not gained. Take your time with it. The insomnia was pretty bad but I'm leveling out. Muscle stiffness was a slight problem but I do yoga or stretch everyday.",0,20
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Awful, terrible med! Seriously! Makes you extremely tired! I was so excited about this med after watching the commercials and how it  covers all phases  of bipolar. At 1.5 mg, it knocks you out. On the next day, you're still just tired and have no motivation to get to work and be productive! Made my anxiety worse! Exacerbated the stress I was dealing with at the time! Would go to sleep with a knot in my gut. I quit the med and I had the worst 3 days of depression Ive had in a while, maybe even the worst ever! I cried in front of my supervisor at work. Be careful with the withdrawals! Depression is  the worst!!!",0,17
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Bipolar for 27 years. Been on every medication available prior to 2010. Never had hallucinations till trying Vraylar. After just a few doses I saw baby dragons crawling up the side of my fireplace. Didn't take it long enough to know if it helped my bipolar.  But I do know that even if it did, Vraylar is definitely not for me.",0,20
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I was on vrylor 1.5 mg for about 18 days. Felt on top of the world, thought I found a wonder drug.  Little did I realize I was getting more hyper and could not sleep past 5- 6 am.  Which is early for me. Been off this med for 6 days now and still having sleep problems. Wake up for the bathroom and now can't get back to sleep still!",0,15
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 On Vraylar and so far its okay, except for some pretty bad insomnia.  My mood is more positive and have some mild anxiety.  Pleased so far, but hoping for more.  Taking for bipolar depression.",0,11
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I had been on Seroquel for a few years and it just quit working. After spending 4 months cycling between depressive and mixed episodes my psych doc put me on 3mg of Vraylar and within 4 days the depressive episode stopped and I was able to return to a normal life pretty quick. I've been on it 3 months and I've had no depressive/mixed/manic episodes since then so Vraylar has been a godsend for me.,0,27
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 This has been a life changer for me. I was on a number of different medications for my bipolar 1 disorder and had very little relief before vraylar.,0,26
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Vraylar is not recommended for people that are bi polar or have a family history of dementia I had a very bad reaction to vraylar.,0,10
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Tried many mood stabilizers since 2004 when after a manic episode and failed suicide, I was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder, tried various mood stabilizers had too many side effects and manic episodes. Finally Vraylar came on the market and my doc prescribed it. I've been on it for 2 years and have had 1 manic episode and have an anxiety disorder I never had. With that being said, Vraylar has been the best prescribed medication yet.  I have no side effects. They only problem is the cost, because it's not generic yet. So with a Medicare advantage insurance, I have a $382 out of pocket copays. Right know my physiatrist is able to give me samples. I haven't found a patient assist program that helps.",0,23
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 This medication is the best one I have been on and I have been on many. Latuda made me hallucinate and I ended up jumping out a second story window. Seraquel made me sleep all of the times. Abilify did not work at all. The other medications were out of my price range.  My insurance company recommended that I try these and a few others prior to approving coverage of Vraylar. I was receiving samples from the public service agency I was in prior to my mother purchasing insurance for me. I am diagnosed Bipoar 1 with psychotic tendencies (hearing voices not in my head but in the rooms Im in. They are cruel critical of my actions and threatening that I will be arrested, hurt by my loved ones etc.  Vraylar is the only medications Ive taken so far that has helped ease these symptoms",0,26
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Took Vraylar for about 2 months. The restlessness in my body was the worst part for me. I couldnt get my arms comfortable to type at work which is 100% of my job. Also I started worrying about stuff more than I normally did, was called paranoid by my sister. Otherwise it worked great. Also experienced weight gain, but it was during the holidays to be fair.",0,16
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 HORRIBLE (for me), only 2 weeks in.  Made feel so disconnected and weird, paranoid, racing horrible thoughts, panic attacks, extremely sleepy and sluggish shortly after taking it and throughout the next day.  Now, coming off of it is making nervous and panicky, so I'm having to take Xanax daily to reverse these withdrawal side effects, of which I only take Xanax occasionally.  I cannot wait for this drug to be completely out of my system. NEVER AGAIN!!",0,23
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Question for ppl who's been taking Vraylar for awhile. What's the best time of the day to take this medicine? Because I feel like it makes me sleepy but when I took it at night I've noticed the next day I was still snappy and in a bad mood so advice on when to take it please ? And other advice as well I would appreciate it because I am a beginner on this medicine!!!,0,15
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I have been taking this medication for two weeks. The restlessness is almost gone. It has saved my life I love this medication. I feel like I can change my life finally! I saw give it a try. Its very smooth on the side effects unlike Latuda.,0,10
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I was just wondering if anyone else was experiencing rapid weight gain with this medication Vraylar. Im on week 3 and Ive already gained weight and my agitation is terrible. Any advice would be appreciated.,0,19
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I love this medication. No more mixed episodes of bipolar. Im on 4.5 mg only problem i have is insomnia.,0,9
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I was enthusiastic to begin Vraylar because the commercials made it look like a wonder drug for bipolar mixed episodes. I have to say it has helped but I can't know how much because I'm already on Wellbutrin (antidepressant), Lithium (mood stabilizer), and Seroquel (antipsychotic/sleep aid). Vraylar does cause wicked akathisia and, most notably for me, it does cause weight gain. I've been on it for over three months and I gained ten pounds easily. This amount is a lot for me, especially when it's so hard to lose. I am always hungry and I worry I am showing early signs of diabetes. I would like to go jogging but lately I've had no motivation to go. My swollen body feels helpless. I am going to try going off of Vraylar to see if I can become normal self. Do I really need this drug?  We shall see...",0,17
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Started taking Vraylar to calm my mania.  1 month in I became hypersexual on it with worse mania and began to dislike intercourse at the same time, although I wanted to have intercourse all the time.  Very strange.  I'm going off of it when I talk to my doctor.  Pins and needles in feet.  Liked it otherwise.",0,8
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Today is the first day Im taking it. I suffer from panic attacks and racing thoughts , highs and lows. Im all jacked up! Lol Im reading the reviews and Im kinda worried, but Ive got to give it a try. Everyone is different, Im hoping I am one of the lucky ones. It says it can cause weight gain but if I continue to eat healthy I shouldnt have a problem. I will repost again with my thoughts on the drug.",0,17
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 HORRIBLE. My psychiatrist put me onto this a few weeks ago. It made me feel loopy and drowsy so taking it at night wasnt a problem, however as soon as I would take it immediately I would fall asleep. I would then wake up at the slightest sound and not be able to go back to bed. I also had the side effect of akathisia that would keep me up. It was to the point I had to pace around to keep myself at bay. Sitting down was uncomfortable, standing up was uncomfortable as well. I also did not see much of difference in my mood. I just got switched to latuda due to these issues..hopefully it works.",0,10
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I am already so thankful to get off my last medication. I have been extremely restless at night, but I am still at to wake everyday at 5am and work a laborious 10 hour shift. I appreciate this after having to endure three months of lithium while working as an automotive technician. I am still with a clear head, and I haven't noticed any significant anxiety problems such as my last medication. Although, it will take weeks such as lithium to see what will actually take place, my digestive problems have diminished (huge cry out!!). I do have problems with appetite but not to a point where it has affected me while actually sitting down with food. I tend to enjoy that part no matter, and I've take medication that completely shuts off your enjoyment of food. Overall, I am ok with seeing if this will improve a long the way down and test out the symptoms that will occur.",0,4
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I love this medication!!! I feel better, act better, can tolerate just about anything now. I take 3mg and feel its the best for me right now.  Taking new medication is scary but Vraylar was by far the best decision.  I am happy now!! I think clearly. I smile. I laugh. I do things now. I get out of bed and have a purpose. I love my life. I do have blurred vision with Vraylar but I also feel its because I need a eye exam. I sleep great in vraylar and I actually have lost weight.  I would tell this person reading this please try it and I feel and hope you will love it as much as I do.  Best medication EVER",0,48
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 It works really well for me, but I have been having a problem getting the drugI was told there is a shortage on manufacturing and my pharmacist is having problems ordering it!",0,8
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 My experience with this drug is somewhat good I no longer hallucinate and Ive seen to focus better at school,0,7
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Worked great for a few months, then gave me really bad anxiety and racing thoughts. I want off this.",0,12
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I've been taking Vraylar for 5 weeks 1.5 mg and I can't sleep more than 2-3 hrs a night. It has made my blood pressure go up. I also feel restless and have anxiety I've never had before. I'm being treated for bipolar and manic disorder my energy is gone I'm tired all the time. Not for me I'm going to stop taking it today was on line reading reviews to see why I feel the way I do. Well now I know,0,15
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I was on lamictal 200XR and Geodon 40 Mg switching to Vrylar 3mg. I have not enjoyed the switch. I have a job that requires me to make decisions quickly, be calm, and teach others. Since starting the Vrylar I have not been able to talk without having a hard time finding my words. I feel angry, and can not handle any stress. My body feels like I need to just move and can not be comfortable with any position. My eyes are heavy and I feel like I could just fall asleep if I didnt fight it.  I just feel so out of touch with who I am behavioral wise since taking this in a negative way.  I would not recommend this. I am stopping the medication with my doctors help.",0,14
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I took Vraylar as an add on along side Wellbutrin and Lithium for Major depressive disorder. I took the med as directed at night, went to bed. The next morning I got out of bed walked a few paced and then my ears started ringing, I got sweaty, my vision dimmed and I passed out on the floor. My mom (who has a background in nursing) had to revive me. Both my blood sugar and blood pressure had crashed. I picked up the medication info. for Vraylar looked it over and saw that the med. may lower your blood sugar and blood pressure.  So the moral of the story for me was always read the med. info packet.  Also if you have naturally low blood pressure or blood sugar issues you'd be better off not taking this med.  (Note: I am not a M.D. and this is just my opinion from my own personal experience with the drug.)",0,18
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I got insomnia starting the 2nd day and could only sleep with Olanzapine. After a couple weeks I decided to stop, and the withdrawal was so bad. I couldn't sleep, even with 15mg Olanzapine, my heart was beating super fast, I had a pseudo panic attack (and I don't suffer from anxiety at all, it never happened to me before) and only managed to calm down and sleep because I was given   an Ativan (Lorazepam). Don't get me wrong, if this drug works for you, great. But for me, it was the worst reaction I ever had to a drug, and I've been on countless anti-depressants, mood stabilizers and anti-psychotics.",0,15
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Had a bad experience with Zyprexa  for bipolar so my doc switched me to 1.5mg of Vraylar. I was so excited at first because its been said to be the best of the best. First few days, I felt...off. I chalked it up to coming off of Zyprexa. By day 5, I couldnt sleep more than 2-3 hours IF I was lucky. Id wake up with chest and stomach pain filled anxiety. No appetite whatsoever. Felt like my skin was crawling. I tend to be fearful of starting new meds so I asked my doc if it was normal and he just I was experiencing my  condition  and not the meds. So, like an idiot I gave it another week. The problems only worsened. I cried everyday because my body and emotions felt so uncomfortable. The anxiety was to the point I couldnt leave the house. All I did was want to scream and self harm (never had that desire before). Im now three days off and the anxiety and insomnia are still very VERY real. I just want to feel better. Please use caution with this drug. Its been terrifying for me.",0,26
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Side effects of Vraylar akathisia, insomnia, mild hallucinations, rashes, nausea, double vision, worst med I've ever been on.",0,10
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I've been on this rollercoaster of a med for two weeks now. At first, I could have sworn I was as good as new except for the insomnia. Come day eight or so, I was crawling out of my skin. Jerking arms, wringing feet, and nearly impossible to sleep. Worst akathisia I ever got from a med. Also, double vision, nausea, and constipation. I'm at two weeks akathesia to the point of not being able to sleep. Actually having mild hallucinations at this point. All I feel like on this med is a guinea pig.",0,16
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 On Vraylar I had horrendous akathisia for two weeks with insomnia averaging 90 minutes a night. Junk should be taken off the market,0,11
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I will start tonight.  I've been reading all comments so I will give it a chance, they give me 1.5. Im bipolar and anxiety and panic attacks and paranoid and seroquel was not helping me at all",0,7
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I love Vraular so far. Really has helped me see life a different way. I feel more optimistic and happy. A problem that I have noticed is I have become more agitated but Ive only just started the medicine two weeks ago. So hopefully the agitation will go away.,0,15
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 After trying numerous meds this finally worked for me. The only bad part is it has caused me to gain 20lbs. I started at 155 now I'm 175. It makes me constantly hungry. Why did I rate it so high?  I finally felt feel like the old me. I have energy my moods are better controlled  And it controls my anxiety. The pluses outnumber the negatives. I started on the lowest dose now I'm on 3 mg. It made me nauseous and irritible the first few days. But I noticed the difference quickly. I hope this will help someone that is looking for a new med.,0,34
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Vraylar is the first antipsychotic I've tried for my recent diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Even in just a few days, I noticed such a change. I was happy, motivated, not snapping on everyone, the list goes on. It was really GREAT! However.... now I am experiencing horrific vertigo, to the point to where I am falling and getting injured. Stopped taking the med (lowest dose, 1.5mg) 3 days ago and I cannot wait until it is out of my system. Also, noticed some bad rebound agitation.  Maybe because I am so worried and anxious about my dizziness, but the agitation is pretty bad.  *took for two days, stopped for four days (was getting bad leg cramps and NP advised me to stop this and see if that was the cause). Started back and was going on four days and the charley horses and dizziness began. Kept taking the med until day six. Now awaiting to see if stopping the med will make the dizziness go away. Vraylar has a looooong half life, so it can take several weeks to clear ones body.",0,10
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 After 20 years of being medicated, I can finally say that Ive found a pill that makes people feel more violent. Its Vraylar. I took it for about 10 days. I felt myself becoming more angry and easily agitated as I continued to take it. I took it at night and would notice myself becoming a bit insane around 2pm everyday. Im literally afraid of this medication.",0,15
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I was given Vraylar 3mg (samples because I couldn't afford it even with insurance!) for my  bipolar/manic episodes uncontrolled by other meds.. Unfortunately I didn't get to see if it worked because 4 days of massive migraine type headaches and nausea (some with vomiting, sometimes w/o) I stopped for a little over a week and the headache and nausea went away IMMEDIATELY. Doctor encouraged me to try again (1.5mg this time) I took it for 3 days... same scenario. I read the side effects and both are listed there but this wasn't just slight discomfort, it was SEVERE. I asked my Doc if I might be allergic he said it was just the side effects and I should push through, but it was not going to happen. After reading ALL OVER THE internet anything Vraylar related, and speaking with a few people who have taken it, I have found only 25-30% have seen benefits from this medication. Maybe if that number was higher.. I might have  pushed through  but I'm just not seeing the point.",0,14
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I just started Vraylar and don't really notice a difference in my moods. I have slept horribly the last two nights tossing and turning and waking up at odd hours. During the day I'm tired and sluggish.,0,13
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 20 years old, Female with bipolar. The first few weeks on Vraylar I experienced restlessness, drowsiness and hot flashes. After my body adjusted to the medication, all I can say is that its worked wonders for me.

Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Ive been taking 200mg Seroquel (helps me sleep) with 3mg Vraylar and my bipolar 1 is totally under control for the past 3 years.   Vraylar doesnt make me tired but with the Seroquel Im in great shape.   Thank God and my doctor.,0,26
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I have been on Vraylar for two weeks for bipolar depression. I take 3mg at bedtime. The first day after I had taken it the Vraylar sent me into a manic state.The second day I was equally manic but the mania was more or less controllable if that makes sense...Haha. Two weeks in I can feel the Vraylar working because Im more optimistic toward life. I look forward to things again. Only side effects I had were slight fatigue and of course the first few days of mania. I do recommend this drug if youre feeling empty and alone and just want to be left alone all together. Im grateful to actually laugh again.,0,39
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I am 72 and have had bipolar 1 since the age of 15. I have never been well since menopause age 50, and have tried every drug on the market. Finally, I went to a new doctor (NP) who put me on Vraylar. I was very wary of anti-psychotics because I started getting really shaky with Seroquel and Zyprexa. However, Vraylar seems OK. I have been on it for 3 months, started on 1.5 for 7 days, had to go up to 3mg due to a big manic episode that last 8 days. Vraylar stopped it the next day. The problems have been exceptionally vivid dreams and insomnia. I take many other things for insomnia, but nothing works. I have been lying awake for hours ever since starting this medication. It is such a shame as I have never felt better in my life. I am going to see my doctor on Wednesday to see what she thinks.",0,37
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Other than the restless legs and sleep disruption, which goes away after a few weeks, Vraylar is the first medication I have found that really works for me, and worked quickly, too. I tried about 7 different antipsychotics before finding this one, and it has truly helped with my depression and mood swings. I can still feel my cycles trying to pull me in those directions, but it's like I have a choice now, and the option to make rational decisions.",0,37

Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I've been on 1.5mg about 3 weeks now.

I had zero side effects, which for me is highly unusual since I often have even rare side effects from most drugs. As for weight gain, I havent noticed any from it.

Total life changer. I did have an upset stomach the first day or two, but after that, no upset just great mood, no anger, anxiety or depression. Take 1.5 mg every other day and still feel great on second day, so that seems to be sufficient. Also continue the Xanax for sleep. I wake up refreshed and feel like I've gotten better sleep.

Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I was only on 1.5 mg Vraylar for 3 days. I had severe side effects which lasted 5 days after my doc pulled me off of this poison. The psychic and physical pain was absolute torture. The suicidal ideation I'd been experiencing prior to Vraylar ramped up big time. Every cell in my body was in screaming. My doc took me off it after 3 days. What he neglected to mention is that Vraylar stays in your system for 2 weeks. The This is my 9th day off of Vraylar and I'm finally beginning to feel better. Have had night sweats the last 3 days so my body is detoxing the Vraylar. I've been in treatment for refractory bipolar 1 mixed episodes MDD for 27 years, and Vraylar was far and away the worst experience I've had on a med, and I've been on them all.",0,27

Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I began at 1.5 then titrated to 3mg dosage. At first, I loved the medicine, as it completely eliminated my depressive symptoms and helped regulate my sleep. However, after being on the medicine for two weeks, I developed Akisthesia and was told to stop. However, for those who do not experience TDS or EPS from the medicine, I imagine this will be a solid option to consider. Just be warned- the most common side effect listed is restlessness, which hit me hard and fast.",0,20
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 So I have been on almost every anti-psychotic out there. So now my pdoc put me on Vraylar. I was going through a bad mixed episode, severe depression, not leaving the house, racing thoughts, etc. The Vraylar has helped with all of that. My pdoc started me at 1.5mg for 2 days then upped it to 3mg. The depression got better almost immediately but now I'm having extreme anxiety- can't stop moving my leg. So he increased it yesterday to 4.5mg &amp; so far no change in the anxiety but its only been 1 day. I'm just hoping the anxiety is due to the episode &amp; not a side effect of this med. Altho now I'm feeling a tad manic. Also, sleep has been an issue. It makes me sleepy but I sleep restlestless &amp; wake up at 7am, but I'm wide and rested so its ok.",0,19
Cariprazine,"<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Hi, this is an updated experience.  I have now been on Vraylar for just under 2 months.  Once the side effects (PAIN!!! Lack of sleep, blurred vision) wore off, it really became a miracle. Even other people notice a difference.  I did have to increase my dose, which caused severe tiredness and restlessness for a few days, but all in all it wasn't horrible. If you've been on stuff like Geodon, the tiredness isn't even comparable, but definitely tired.  My biggest issue is the weight gain. I have BED on top of Bipolar and this has made my BED rear it's ugly head BAD. But, my doctor wants me to keep with the meds because he feels it's a side effect that will wear off.  Overall, very happy with my improvement.",0,16

No need for naps any more.",0,32
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I started it about 2 weeks ago. I'm already on 6mg. I can say without a doubt this is my favorite medicine I've been on. It helps so much where it is needed. I have an addiction problem. this medicine works with your dopamine level which generally makes you happier if you truly are not happy and helps you to NOT USE. I haven't felt this good since I was a kid. I had no side affects after the first 3 days.,0,22

Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Was having a bad dysphoric Mixed state. Was having racing thoughts that were highly illogical. I couldn't stand myself. After 2 to 3 days on the drug I started feeling better and had the best sleep I'd had in years. So far I highly recommend.,0,17
Cariprazine,<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I am titrating on 3 mg of Vraylar for week 2 and all my agitation is gone. I feel calm and sensible now. I'm tapering off of seroquel so I do not know how beneficial it will be with sleep but there's less sedation during the day which is a plus. I would recommend vraylar because of its low side effects profile.,0,27
Cariprazine,"This medicine pushed me into psychosis and extreme mania. I would run upwards of 6 miles a night and still have energy. With all that running I still managed to gain 25lbs.

Unfortunately, even with the copay, I can't afford it. So I'm switching to another antipsychotic. Just sharing that this medication does work.  My blood sugar didn't go sky high, which was a huge fear of mine because I did go full blown diabetic and had to be hospitalized on other antipsychotics ( which I will not name).

Abilify,I just started this Abilify at a 5mg dose and am going up to 10 mg today. Side effects were - nausea briefly -  restlessness that might keep waking you up at night. Both of these went away. I was told by my psych that I might feel shaky but that should pass. Positives so far are less rumination and constant thinking. Less daydreaming. It doesnt affect my actual ability to think. I havent gone manic on this yet. My temperament seems to be even and my energy level is good. I'll check back in in a month with the 10mg review. Thanks all.,8,9
Abilify,"I took this medication for about two months I'd say. The highest I ever went to was 5mg. While it did work on the depression, it made the mania a lot worse to the point where I went psychotic and ended up in the hospital. The biggest issue I had was that the doctor was very intent on keeping me on this drug despite the fact it was not working.",1,4
Abilify,"Abilify and zoloft work well for my bipolar depression. My mood was never been so controlled, I feel like a new and normal person. It kills my sex drive so I also take a supplement for women which helps a lot.",10,14
Abilify,"Abilify helped with my manic episodes, but gained 15 pounds after a month and spiralled into a horrible depression that saw me in bed for weeks after I tried to come off the drug. Felt near completely disabled. Not for me.",1,17
Abilify,This medication has ruined my self esteem and essentially my life. I have gained 50 lbs from this medication. That wasnt a typo 50 freaking lbs!!! Ive recently stopped taking it but no weight has come off yet. Im beside myself. I dont know what to do. I hate the way I look now.,1,24
Abilify,"Be careful, Abilify caused a massive compulsive gambling addiction where I lost tens of thousands over time. I mentioned it to the doctor early on but she ignored it, didn't note it or change the meds. Guess I was hooked on the buzz. Stopped taking Abilify.  Stopped gambling recklessly. Compulsive gambling addiction is a mental health disorder itself.  Who'd have thought that the NHS would prescribe this dangerous drug that can cause it? Sounds ridiculous but true.  There was a guy with Parkinsons prescribed it in England, went full on the National Lottery online games and scratch cards etc ... but won his case for not being advised properly of the potential side effects and got most of the losses back. They don't care for my complaint.   A class action lawsuit is underway in the United States because it wasn't on the label.  Suing a big Japanese pharmaceutical company seems okay. Lost all interest in work and drifted for 18 months.",2,12
Abilify,"I am diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and in my 20s suffered through 3 major manic psychotic episodes which led to at least month long hospitalizations each time. After the first episode, I was put on zyprexa in which I felt zombified and depressed on which led me to go off of it entirely. Less than a year later I was hospitalized again and at that point I was introduced to Abilify. Three years passed during which I was stable. I then went off of it which led to my third and final hospitalization. Ever since then I took the 20mg tablets religiously and would soon combine it with Lamictal. This combo has worked wonders for me. Years ago a doctor told me that Im on the Rolls Royce of bipolar medication and I firmly agree. About a year ago I started taking the 400mg injection which helped me lose at least 30 pounds. I find the injection the most effective method of taking Abilify. It has been a life saver for me!",10,25
Abilify,"Have been on Abilify (Generic) for about a month now. My lows are higher and my highs are nonexistent. Im mostly flat emotionally, lacking interest in everything, including people. Good for my irritability and delusions, but the side effects are tough.",5,18
Abilify,"I am a 24 year old male with Bipolar II. Depression is what I struggle with 98% of the time. I have been taking this med  Abilify for about a month now, so long enough. I switched to this from Zyprexa, and that switch was rough. My anxiety came back worse than before on this med and the restlessness was too much for me. I took 5mg and I would get an hour or two of sleep per day and not be able to sit still during the day. I will say that it cured my depression completely, so for that I am grateful. As far as my anxiety, sleep, and overall mood it has not improved. Moving up in dosage caused more restlessness and moving down to 2.5mg or less made me tired and didn't do much for my mood. This med didn't work for me but its not the worst med, give it a shot. I'm switching to Latuda, wish me luck.",6,16
Abilify,"I am 31, female with bipolar 1 along with depression (obviously lol), extreme social anxiety and PTDS.  I was on abilify, all the way up to 20mgs at the last year or so.  I truly thought it wasn't working or doing ANYTHING for me anymore, so switched to Latuda.  Well the pharmacy was out of stock of Latuda and I had just finished my taper off of Abilify,  so I was about 4-5 days off of any mood stabilizer.  And now I can say that although it may not have been as effective as when I first went on it, it definitely made a difference!  Since the second week of my taper (down to 5 mg, then 2) I applied for some more credit cards and thought nothing of it.  In the past 2 days, I have maxed out all those credit cards.  It wasn't until last night I put the connection to me not being on anything.  I gained a little weight on it, but at the same time,  I allowed myself to eat what I wanted and didn't exercise.  During the taper, I tried seroquel and abilify is nothing as bad as that weight wise.",8,19
Abilify,"Ability was the first medication prescribed following my bipolar diagnosis, I was told it had a side effect of weight gain. When I first started it, for 14 days, I was MISERABLE...I couldn't eat, sleep, use the restroom, lay down without fidgeting, focus or stop thinking super fast. But on day 15, all those awful effects disappeared. I never experienced anything bad other that weigh gain.  I had the same side effects weaning off it. (That was 300+ pounds ago. I didn't change my eating or exercising habits) In 2017 my new psychiatrist changed medications and I dropped 41 pounds in two years the Abilify slowed my metabolism.  I mainly noticed how it gave me a sense of controlled well being.  In the 15 years I took it, I only missed two doses. I figured if I did my part, medication and stayed actively involved in my own therapy then life would be best it could.",8,26
Abilify,"Been on every BiPolar med known.  Finally tried Abilify (generic)  and this  for me, is the VERY BEST bipolar medication in the world.  No highs, no lows, NO bipolar  symptoms at all.  Ive never known in my 45 years that a bipolar drug could make me feel so  normal .  Truly happy, level headed and carefree.  Sleep is normal for the first time ever.  Id rate it an  11  if I could!  CHANGED MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER, literally!  I TAKE aripiprazole 10mg once daily, Prozac as well.",10,35
Abilify,"Up until recently, I was taking just 1 mg of Abilify along with 300 mg of Lamictal.  My doctor had me on 2, but I felt like it made me feel apathetic and kind of dissociated, so I began cutting the pill in half.  I did notice that I felt less depressed, could focus better, and did not experience such strong mood episodes.   However, within a month I was experiencing this extremely intense paranoia that I never had before.  I had chest pains and headaches regularly.  I couldn't eat and often felt sick because of how anxious I was.  So yes, Abilify did benefit me alongside this weird side effect.  My doctor had me convinced the medication wasn't causing the paranoia, it was just me, but as soon as I stopped taking it the headaches, chest pains, and bursts of anxiety have stopped.  I do feel more depressed and my mood swings have come back harder.  I'm getting a new doctor soon to hopefully put me on another type of antipsychotic",4,13
Abilify,I had so many horrible experiences with  meds for my bipolar. It scared me to try one more but I'm now on 2mg of abilify once daily and found my old self again after a very long time living an unbearable life. The only side effect is slight insomnia and I'm losing the ton of weight that I gained while on seroquel. Abilify saved my life.,0,26
Abilify,"This made me feel absolutely horrible. It gave me worse derealization, anxiety, and anhedonia, worse than I have ever had. I do NOT recommend ever trying this stay away from it!!!",1,12
Abilify,"I was prescribed Abilify after experiencing a 3-4 month long hypomanic episode. I was on Lamictal 100mg but that wasnt helping alone so my psychiatrist decided to add in Abilify. She also said it would help with the mild paranoid thoughts I was having. This was a horrible medication for me personally. It may work for other people, but it wasnt for me. It made me flat and I didnt care about anything anymore. I wasnt depressed on it, I just didnt care about anything. Even the people around me commented on how apathetic I had become. It made my fears of psychiatric medications come true. I lost my personality, passion, and energy. I am off of it now, and feel way better. I think it served its purpose of getting me out of my hypomanic episode, which is why I gave it a 4-star rating, but I couldnt see being on this medication long-term.",4,13
Abilify,On Abilify for Bipolar and it is the first time in my entire life that I have felt stable. I have no side effects from this medication. I take it at night and it makes me a bit sleepy which is good for my sleep anyways. I have tried a few other mood stabilizers without success and finally tried Abilify and it works fantastically for me.,10,32
Abilify,I HATE this drug! I have the more depressive side of bipolar disorder and for some reason got put on this antipsychotic instead of antidepressants. I have had irritability followed by flat affect. All of my creativity is gone as is my sex drive. I'm starting to get more and more depressed. My medicines provider keeps saying to wait or cancelling appointments! I'm probably going to taper myself off if things don't get changed soon.,2,13
Abilify,"I feel like a new woman on Abilify! I have Bi-Polar II, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I have tried Lithium (gained too much weight and my thyroid went wacky), Lamictal (skin rash) and Topamax (which I currently take 50 mg at night to counteract the possible side effect of weight gain with Abilify). I have NOT gained any weight on Abilify! I was hesitant to take it, and now Im kicking myself for not starting it sooner because I feel amazing! I have energy, depression and anxiety are GONE, and my bi-polar symptoms have vanished. This is a miracle drug for me! Give it a try if you are questioning it, because I wish I would have tried it sooner! Im 46 years old and I am 510  and weigh 165 pounds with a BMI of 24 (Average).",10,48
Abilify,"This medication  Abilify almost killed me. I started it in January  for bipolar and felt flat and slightly suicidal (as I had before starting it) for about two months on it. Experienced some weight gain. After the two months, I began to have obsessive suicidal thoughts to the point I couldn't concentrate. Oddly enough, I didn't feel depressed just non-stop suicidal thoughts. I got off of it and switched to lithium, haven't had a suicidal thought in months!",1,15
Abilify,"I tried to give Abilify a chance three times. I find no interest in activities, not suicidal but dont feel inspired or a purpose to anything, I just want to be in bed all day and I easily get emotionally hurt or offended. I felt everyone would stare and judge me and so my Doctor kept saying that I would get better after a couple of weeks. The first few days I felt very high and happy, I also had high levels of energy but I couldnt finish one thing before starting another. I also began to feel extreme panic, I had constant panic attacks, flushing sensation and once I began to lessen the dose to come off I experienced vertigo. I had not felt this before and I was in a panic thinking I had some tumor or had something haywire my nervous system and would never be the same. I stopped in July and its now October I still have vertigo but not as intense, I was just prescribed Wellbutrin and Im really hoping it helps me. Everyone is different but this was my personal experience",3,10
Abilify,"I took abilify for over 6 years and at first it worked very well. Year 2 I started having face twitching, shakiness and stuttering speech. 3rd year I started with tardive dyskinesia. 4-6 ish years I had all the aforementioned and added falling at least 6 times a day, I was so shaky I could barely walk, plus my memory was shot. I couldn't remember my  phone number or email address I had had for 10 years. New psych took me off and within 2 months almost all of the symptoms were gone. I think some of the shakiness and memory loss are permanent but I have a new lease on life. Poison. Pure poison. I wish I could have those 6 years back.",1,22
Abilify,"Thank you all so much for your candid feedback!! I needed this for support and better understanding. I sobbed reading every comment, because I can relate.  My 18 year old son has psychosis and mania. Meds just changed. Lithium dropped due to  out of range  high toxicity.  Antipsychotic med. Risperidone, no longer affective after a year. He has been on Abilify for 1 week. After 1 day, I could tell his psychosis was disappearing.  He realized date on the calendar, acted as if he had missed a month of his life. Then immediately jumped back in the game! He showered with soap! His obsessive, fixated thoughts and actions stopped, and he quickly  reprioritized his responsibilities.  Side affects- nausea, sick, no appetite for days.  (Zofran) is helping.  Slightly more aggravated at times, pesters family, a little removed, impulsive and quick to snap. Its only been a week, so hoping these symptoms stop, and mood levels out. Thank you again for sharing! Love and wellness to all",7,17

Anger outbursts that were uncharacteristic of me, impulsivity, akasthasia horrible kicking legs as I tried to go to sleep. Doc was kind enough to pull me off it as I gained 20 pounds in this month. Ridiculous. It was not a  live saver  for me either.",1,11
Abilify,"This drug destroyed my life. My sexual urges became insatiable and my drug use went supersonic. After the dust settled my marriage was destroyed,  Im broke and my credit rating went 750 to 400. Ive lost all credibility with my family and friends.

Earlier when I was just depressed so they added Abilify to my Zoloft.  It did not spark joy at all, made me gain 15 pounds. But a year later I developed psychosis and they gave me Abilify once again.

Abilify,"I had commented approximately 2 weeks ago  (under the name:  I hate abilify. on the 2019-07-09) regarding the 400 mg abilify injection. Well I saw my new pdoc on the 18th and she is wonderful!!! I am no longer on the injection due to side effects.  In addition to all of the side effects noted previously, I forgot to mention the major weight gain also.  This drug is NOT WEIGHT NEUTRAL!!  IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR WEIGHT MOVE ON TO THE NEXT DRUG.  If you're not happy with your current pdoc find someone you are happy with.  Just because we have bipolar disorder or have a mental illness does not mean we can not control what we ingest into our body.  You have a choice!!! If you have a feeling of being trapped and your pdoc not listening to your concerns, MOVE on!!!! Good luck to all of you.....",1,20
Abilify,Helped with mania and depression. Stopped taking due to weight gain and erectile dysfunction.,4,6

I am having muscle spasms as I am typing right now.  I also have dry mouth, constipation, depression and agitation. I had this doctor with tunnel vision ten years ago you think I would have learned my lesson, but I do have an appointment on the 18th with a new proc thank god!!!! God help us all!!!",1,14
Abilify,"Abilify levels out my mania like nothing else but does nothing for my depression. Causes regular chest pain, weakness, and awful akathesia. Works for the most part, but I would definitely not recommend due to side effects.",4,8
Abilify,"The most terrible drug I have ever been put on. Always tired, trouble moving and dizziness. Would not recommend this drug to anyone.",1,10
Abilify,"A psychiatrist of very questionable competence added Abilify to my antidepressant so that I would have to come back more often for visits (my antidepressant was working fine).  The six weeks that I was on Abilify, I could not sit still in a chair for even five minutes.  All I would do is pace.  I have never been classified as bipolar by anyone but this doctor (major depression - yes) and I lived a nightmare while taking Abilify.  I don't wish this on anyone.  If a doctor suggests that you take this drug, please ask a lot of questions and do some research on your own.",1,11
Abilify,"I was on this for over 3 years. To start with I thought it was working, the last year I had a racing head and high anxiety. Was discharged from psych so had to fight to get seen again to change medication. Realised a few months after coming off it that my finances had changed shortly after starting Abilify and not in a good way. I was never in debt before Abilify. I am 37 too. Im in a lot of debt because of Abilify because I started taking out loans shortly after starting it amongst other things. Have since read that the FDA made the manufacturing company to list compulsive shopping, compulsive gambling and other excessive behaviours etc as a side effect in May 2016. I started it in August 2015 so was unaware when I researched this medication when I first went on it. No Dr made me aware of this side effect at any point. Please note I have been manic prior to this medication and had never taken out credit or borrowed money.",1,11
Abilify,"I have a mood disorder and an anxiety disorder. Ive been taking Zoloft for ~3 years, and although it helped with anxiety, it didnt touch my intense mood swings. After a very bad mood swing that almost broke up my 7 year relationship, I sought help. My psychiatrist put me on Lamictal first, and it gave me hives. Then we tried trileptal, and the GI side effects were unbearable after 2 weeks. Finally she put me on Abilify and so far it has been great. Ive been on 2 mg of Abilify (with 50 mg Zoloft) for a week and there have been almost no side effects. I was warned there might be dry mouth or excessive sweating but Ive been fine. It did cause me to wake up 7-8 times during the night, but I switched to taking it in the morning and now I sleep like a baby again! It has only been a week but Im starting to feel a difference: I have more energy and I feel more in control of my moods",9,15
Abilify,"Terrible experience. Started on 4 mg then the next day I couldnt stop puking, had dangerously low blood pressure, and they couldnt feel a pulse. Im 19 and this is a relatively low dose to start on. I really think this medicine needs to be recalled because it is so dangerous. I would NOT recommend this drug",1,11
Abilify,"Abilify works well for my bipolar, it really helped with my reaction to stimulus.",10,14
Abilify,"Caused extreme hysterical sobbing  and suicidal-level depression after only 3 doses. I had to be hospitalized via ambulance, and spent an additional 2 days sobbing in my hospital room with the curtains closed. Ive had bipolar II for 22 years, and this was, without a doubt, the most nightmarish emotional experience I have ever had.",1,9
Abilify,"Of all the conditions this medication treats it seems that the lowest reviews come from people, like myself, who have bipolar disorder. I came to this site to read other reviews to see if what Ive been feeling was somehow related to Abilify. Im glad I read some of the reviews because now I dont feel as crazy.  My new psychiatrist was so confident that this medication would work that Ive been convincing myself to ignore the things that were off but now its just unbearable. I am naturally very emotional and before this medication I absolutely hated it but now that I basically feel emotionless I want off of this medication.  Im envious of how this has been a miracle drug for a lot of people but for me its been fogginess, no appetite and just a general feeling  blah . I also stumble over my words a lot and my creativity feels stifled by it. Im calling my psychiatrist tomorrow and getting off of this stuff.",1,8
Abilify,I took this for three months and it caused me to gain 40+ pounds,1,17
Abilify,"Ive tried every mood stabilizer, typical psychotic and atypical antipsychotic for my Aspergers and Bipolar depression, and Abilify always helps the most.  I feel happy on it and it helps me with dysphoric mania consistently.  It does cause weight gain, but I have been able to lose weight on it by cutting calories to 1500 a day and walking regularly.  Plus, it has a generic version now, so its cheap!",8,20
Abilify,"I was started on Abilify  as a mood stabilizer for Bipolar I manic episodes . I was afraid to take it at first (as I am with all meds), but I took 1/4 of the pill days 1-2. Felt no Ill effects except tiredness. Took 1/2 pill for 2 weeks. Noticed immediately my mood levelled out. Still made me tired at night. Groggy in the morning but wore off as the day went on. Now, on a whole 5mg and so far it has been wonderful! I feel so much happier and levelled off with my moods. I feel normal. Its fantastic! It still makes me tired when I first take it at night (so I can sleep finally), but the early morning grogginess is much better. Used to last all morning. Now lasts maybe an hour. Love it!!",10,18
Abilify,"I was once told by a man online that serotonin and dopamine our happy feel good neurotransmitters. And that to contain my bipolar volatility my doctor was turning down the volume. Side effect. I have no get up n go. My head was once a storm.. now a glassy lake. But there is no wind. No sound. No nothing anymore. I feel empty. Numb. Tired, weak, never sad, never happy. Just flat. Im tapering off of all antipsychotics and moving onto lithium orotate. Life could be so much better.",2,22
Abilify,"This drug made my life miserable, dumbed me down, made me like a zombie. Hardly any thoughts or expression &amp; then the Big one..I couldnt sit down! The side effect Akathisia, which is intense restlessness. sounds like no big deal but it was an everyday, every minute struggle I suffered horribly! Id walk down the street to pass time Id count hours till the day was over, I literally couldnt sit down, I sat to eat and had to stand back up as soon as I stopped chewing. I smoked cigarettes for 8 years and I tried to quit every Sunday, turns out that one treatment for Akathisia is nicotine. My doc never picked up on it and I was taking Abilify so long I thought it was just what I had become. When I went off of Abilify I could live again. In almost every way. Not only can I sit down in peace but I can think clearly. I didnt realize how much it was DUMBING ME DOWN. Dont take this Just work on yourself, take other meds. This medication is like a mild lobotomy. Not worth it",1,20
Abilify,"I am a 42 year old woman and  diagnosed with Bipolar and ADHD.  I highly recommend this medication. I was at 10mg and it rescued me from a manic episode that was so bad that I was psychotic. It not only cleared that right up, but it improved my concentration. I did suffer from minor akethesia.  I was able to control it without a problem.  However, three years later, I have gained a lot of weight. I am now taking 5mg and monitoring with my doc. After a month, the weight is coming off, but I am now hypomanic...a beautiful yet scary place to be.  Where to go from here, Im not sure.",7,12
Abilify,"I felt like a different person. I felt weird, socially with drawn, and introverted. I had fogginess in the back of my head. I had no appetite or sex drive. I had shaky legs and hands. I was up all night. I would have times where my eyes were out of focus and I couldnt see straight. Please do not take this medication. Everybody is different but my experience was horrible. As I stopped taking it, these side effects are going away. I couldnt function or do simple tasks.",1,19
Abilify,"Hello, I will love to share My experience with this medication. My name is Tay, and I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder with major mood swings affecting my daily life such as work. I tried Abilify 10 mg and it make me feel like the living dead, no energy feeling tired and really bad increase of anxiety and feeling paranoid. I was then lowered the dosage to 5mg, however is still make me tired and increased of anxiety. My physician does not want to take me off of it. I really do not wish to proceed with this medication. I stopped taking it without letting my doctor know. I really hope to tried something else Thanks",1,17
Abilify,"I've had unexpected benefits with this drug.  For one I am hypoglycemic, and this tends to keep my sugars normal.  Plus when I'm off meds I tend to drink to keep my mind under control-thats a bad thing since I have gastritis.  I had been off it for about two weeks and drank last night and was up half the night with my stomach.  I'm not an alcoholic, have discussed my drinking habits with the doctor, they are not concerned.  But I have started my meds today again because of my stomach.  I love being unmedicated, but this helps me control my thoughts and I don't tend to get out of control on it.  So yes, works 10/10 for me.  I like latuda a little better than this med, but due to cost I'll stick with this one for now.",10,10
Abilify,Gave me extremely painful full-body cramps after a week.,1,2
Abilify,After a few weeks it had me unsettled and tapping my feet 90 miles and hour  It made me nervous  I went down on my dosage to 7.5 and Im better but want off of it  Im just without personality and I feel like theres something better I could take,3,12
Abilify,"Started taking with vistaril after a hospitalization. First caused stomach upset, nausea, and headache. But now nothing! Im waaaay more stable and focused. I get sleepy in the afternoon because I take my meds at noon with lunch.",9,10
Abilify,This drug was initially good at mitigating some aspects of mania for me. It also made me feel less anxious and I cared less about what others thought of me for a few months. The drug seemed to loose its effectiveness and my psychiatrist said it may have been amplifying self harm thoughts. For these reasons I give it a 5/10. I am now on risperidol.,5,7
Abilify,"It did not stabilize my moods. Im still all over the place, and the fact that I cant sit still get really under my nerves. Im super paranoid on this. I feel 10x worse than I did before. It messed me up completely. Side Effects: Severe akathisia, High anxiety, Paranoia, Delusions, Mania, Depression, Suicidal Ideation. I only took this for 2 weeks at a low dose of 5mg and I'M DONE.",3,18
Abilify,"Horrible experience with Abilify. Was like taking speed, but in a really inefficient mess of a way. Could not keep on top of my work, would start a million things and finish none. Stopped after less than a week of use.",2,11
Abilify,Weight gain and depression,4,9
Abilify,"I have a love-hate relationship with this drug. On one hand, it immediately stopped my paranoid thoughts and delusions and made me feel normal again.. mentally. On the other hand, it gave me this unshakable restless and irritated energy. I wasn't able to sit still, complete anything I loved, or even listen to friends. If you don't mind feeling like you have to run a marathon an hour this might work for you.",5,9
Abilify,"I was on abilify for a diagnosis of mixed bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder  following a hospitalization. I was on it for about a year . I found it helpful, and easily tolerated at first - it helped reduce hallucinations and paranoia while improving my fluctuating mood. However, even at its highest dose, it wasnt strong enough or potent enough for me I suppose - it just didnt match up. I continued to have some paranoia and whenever I was more upset than usual, Id have breakthrough hallucinations. What made the docs take me off of it was the oral twitching I developed and bizarre tongue movements, which are signs of tardive dyskinesia, a rare side effect. Newer antipsychotics have less instances of this condition, but its still possible. Anyway, I was taken off of it and placed on another antipsychotic. Still have tongue movements though... An overall okay drug, it works for a lot of people, but not everyone!",8,7
Abilify,"I have been on abilify since Sept 2017. I haven't gained weight, no side effects so far and no anxiety. This drugs helps me to focus and concentrate. It also keeps my moods stable. I take this with lithium 1200mg and seroquel 100mg for sleep. Hopefully it keeps on working.",8,11
Abilify,"I've suffered from Bipolar 2 and GAD and ADD for 15 yrs now. I take Lamictal, Effexor XR, Abilify and Adderall.  Not until I started Abilify 3 weeks ago have I had any improvement with energy levels and depression. I have treatment resistant depression and my anxiety causes me to not be able to work and I barely want to leave the house. But since starting Abilify, I feel almost fantastic. I wake up early ready to start my day. And I've never been a morning person. I'm more positive about my life and I am even thinking about getting a job. I haven't worked in 6 years. But I do have problems staying asleep . I mean, its 3:06am and I am wide awake writing this. So yeah, restless sleep. And the sexual side effects aren't good. Total lack of interest which is difficult when you're in a relationship. But I'm not willing to stop this medication.The good far outweighs the bad in so so many ways. Good luck to all and give this med a try",0,16
Abilify,"One day and done. I've never experienced side effects like this before. I took it before bed and then was up every few hours, restless, mind racing. Finally I shot up at 4am and NEEDED to shower. While in there my head was so heavy, I couldn't stand any more. I had to rest my head. Then I got so nauseated I started to dry heave. Now I'm heavy headed, blurry, dizzy, restless, &amp; afraid to stand up or drive. I will never take this drug again.",0,15
Abilify,"I took it once which made a horrible experience for myself. I woke up from a nap and I had double vision, nausea, vomiting and fainted because of Abilify.",1,8
Abilify,"I'm not sure what mental issues I have exactly, they've told me this and that over the past 15 years. I got people talking going on and seeing them. I also have anger outbursts and take things out on myself, but doesn't happen when I hear and see the people. So anyway, I tried Risperdal before from my doc and it helped me to be able to read and understand what I read, but with Abilify it's not as good, although Risperdal made me have gynecomastia big time, and Abilify doesn't cause as much prolactin. I think it's a decent medication, but the voices and seeing people are still strong and break through the veil, even the mask of the medication, so I'm not cured. But it's better than nothing I guess. But one day I may go off of it.",7,4
Abilify,"This drug has been a lifesaver to me. It's helped provide me with mood stability with an antidepressant effect, whereas lithium only controlled the mania part of my mood. I use this in combination with other drugs  and so far there hasn't been any side effects. I tried decreasing the dosage, and within 2 days I noticed a difference in my mood. I would definitely recommend this drug. This has made a difference in my mood, the way I think, and my overall perspective. This improved my motivation to get work done, since I wouldn't be just sitting around reminiscing in a negative thought loop. It gives me mental freedom and allows me to escape brain fog that has imprisoned my thoughts. Seriously, don't be afraid to try this drug",9,25
Abilify,"Was put on Abilify to control hypomania. I'm very, very sensitive to pretty much every medication. Initial I had a stomach ache that only lasted one night and some tiredness the first two days. However... After this I had severe hypomania and restlessness that just didn't go away. It wasn't akasteisia though. Unfortunately I can't reach the mood stabilizing effect - being at least 10 mg - since I can't go any higher than 1.25 mg without having side effects such as emotional numbness, numbness of my face, twitching, increased eye blinking - which of course scares me since there is a risk of Tardive Dyskinesia. It's definitely a very powerfull drug. BUT it really did help my depression and anxiety, just didn't help control my hypomania. LOL",3,9
Abilify,"The medication, at first, did was it was supposed to do. I was a shut in with some paranoia thrown in and hadn't left my house in over a year, except to go to doctors appointments and get groceries in the house. At first I found the medication got me out and about and got me back into the real world. I signed up for college, got in contact with friends I hadn't talked with in ages, and started living again. For that, this drug was fine. Then the side effects started kicking in. Keep in mind I was on 2mg of this drug and even then the side effects were bad enough to knock me OUT of college and suffer something called Depersonalization through Disassociation. One of the scariest experiences I think I've ever had. I don't recommend it.",3,15
Abilify,This medication was the worst experience of my life and I've been through a lot of rubbish. I experienced insomnia depression anxiety and pesudo ME on abilify. I was on it for 3 months and I spent my time feeling lobotomised and wanting to give up on life. It took me 3 months to fully get back to my old self. Going between depressed and manic. I found a medication that works for me with out professional help afterwards.,1,10
Abilify,"When I first starting taking abilify, I was about 14 and a half and 130 pounds, and it worked great. My mood was great, side effects were minimal. However, over the course of about a year I have gained almost 60 pounds, and that was while playing two varsity sports and a club sport that whole time, so I was active majority of that time. When I came off it recently, I lost about 10 pounds over two weeks, but I was much worse than I was before I went on it, (which I find weird), so I was put back on. It is impossible to get the weight to go away.",2,8
Abilify,"I got extreme manic symptom after I used Abilify for one month. I feel very anxious and scared about everything. I have an illusion energy which leads me push up double times more than no medication usage, but I feel very weak and extreme anxiety in the next few days. It increases my distance between up and down emotion very far away, but the distance between up and down emotion should be neutral. After I withdraw all of them carefully with herbal sleeping pills for alternative, my distant emotion becomes shorter which changes to be neutral condition. When my emotion and mood become neutral, my excessive emotional reaction no longer appear anymore.",0,5
Abilify,I was given this medicine by a regular medical doctor in tandem with Prozac and Ambien.  What a horrible combo!!!!  After being on Abilify for several weeks every nerve ending in my body felt like they were on fire.  I was hyper and couldn't stay seated.  I found out that this medicine was burning my brain and causing Akathisia.   I called my doctor and told him what was going on and he wanted to double the milligram.  I said....ohhhhhhhh no your not!!!!!  Because of this medicine combo things got so bad I tried suicide back in February of 2015.  I took 13 sleeping pills. The hospital doctor in the psych ward said the combination I was on was wrong and he was surprised I wasn't in the hospital earlier !!!,1,10
Abilify,"I give Abilify the highest rating. I'm a 42 year old female with PTSD, Bipolar Depression, ADHD. I have tried every anti-depressant out there, from Amoxapine to Zyprexa, in which I experienced some extremely negative side effects from.  So, needless to say, I am rather reluctant when having to start taking a medication that I've never tried before.  (I've been taking 60mg of Prozac (fluoxetine) daily for the past several years). As of late, I've been experiencing increased symptoms in my bipolar depression.  My doctor prescribed Abilify 5mg about 2 months ago.  I have noticed such a positive change in myself. After only about 5-7 days of taking Abilify did I start to notice a change in my mood, attitude, outlook on life. It's been great!",0,16
Abilify,"It's just silence in my head, its hard to think. I don't have schizophrenia. I just can't really think clearly. All night I stayed up dizzy and nauseous but I'm gonna continue the medicine in hopes that it loosens up and keeps me mellow headed. After the initial nausea I felt pretty chill.  (If it gets better I will keep you guys updated.)",4,7
Abilify,"I had a bad time with this drug. It worked on my mood, but whenever I stood up, I got dizzy. I fell down the stairs once. Plus even with insurance, it's really expensive.",3,6
Abilify,"I like this medication, but it causes my prolactin levels to go up. Which in turn cause my breast to leak milky fluid. Dr said he thinks it is from Invega injection. I just cannot take this side effect",6,4
Abilify,"I have been on this for three days. The first day was horrific and I was definitively going to quit. I felt more trapped and traumatized by the 'problem things' I am dealing with than ever. The weird thing is I  liked my psychiatrist but I felt the drug was killing me. I was horrified by some of the things I am dealing with but now three days later I feel it is starting to balance things out and put me in a humored mood from my 'problems' rather than a traumatized one. I swore off of all psychiatric pills for the past fourteen years, but decided to give it another shot. In the big picture, I think it is the right decision, but it is making me worrisomely hungry.",0,7
Abilify,"I didn't notice a big difference on Ablify. I feel more level headed but also I feel more indecisive, dizzy and restlessness. I was on 10 mg for 3 months and the restlessness was so bad I couldn't sit still.",5,11
Abilify,"I've been prescribed ability and loxapac for a manic episode on May 19th for slightly more than three weeks. It worked well but early June I started to feel unable to sit  still at some places. Around June 10th I had terrible anxiety and panic attacks, it was pure torture, so back to the institution. Had to wait two days until a doctor showed up , gave me something that stopped it all and removed the two drugs. It might be loxapac. Fact is, since then, there is another torture. Akathisia in the form of wanting to walk all the time. It's been one week now and thanks god it stops at night. I want to live (I'm not even 20)  I pray it stops fast  l've suffered enough. I really hate Abilify or Loxapac",1,2
Abilify,"Started taking Abilify in August of 2016. The day after I wanted to drink. I'm a recovering alcoholic, called my physciatrist and she switched seroquel to Thorazine. And I got over the next couple of days. I just received an inheritance somehow I ended up with 191 Groupons, online shopping I couldn't have controlled so much in an amnesia state. Wouldn't have known this was happening. Went to Dr and hospitals 8 or 9 times with different things of Abilify! I had an suicide attempt in March. I stayed awake for 4 days afterwards. I've wrecked my car 4 times. I have TD and Akatasia now. I've never had a drug complicate me as much!   I was also severely anorexic.",1,3
Abilify,"I have bipolar II, cycle up in spring and major depressive in the fall. I have tried lamictal, great drug but got the rash, geodon, ok but felt like I was drunk, latuda, got the jaw pain whitch was awful. Ability seems to help with the overwhelming agitation I get in the spring time. I hope it is as good in the fall for my depression phase.",8,10
Abilify,I've been on abilify for almost a month the only side effect I have is waking up in the middle of the night a few times I have actually lost 12 pounds I am eating good and drinking plenty of water so I'm sure that helps I'm also on Zoloft and topamax all in all it's a much better drug than my previous geodon I would recommend it,6,12
Abilify,"After taking anti-psychotic medications for 9 years and trying just about every single one of  them, I have finally found one that is working for me, at this point in my life. I started this medication  (Abilify) nearly 4 months ago and the positive changes Ive seen in my life make me so happy. I have  lost almost 30 pounds within these last several months, I have been more active with my children, and I  actually get off the couch and walk and enjoy life. Ive been involved with my  FitBit  challenges which I  wouldve never attempted to even think about doing before. My manic episodes are very rare and less  erratic. Before when I would be on a anti-psychotic  medication I would feel like I was in a  zombie mode  barely functioning day by day. The only downfall I have with this medication (Abilify), which is a side effect, is if I get up to  quickly I get dizzy and just collapse. Now Im at a plateau with my weight, but Im not gaining weight  either. I give this Anti-Psychotic Medication a 9 out of 10.",9,32
Abilify,"Excellent. Depression lifted fast. Stabilizes my mood very well, as a bonus I spontaneously los 55 lbs! All that weight came from Seroquel and Zyprexa. Con, has a negative effect on sleep, I need melatonin to be able to sleep. Also my blood pressure is suddenly a lot lower, 102/63 causing some light headedness during the day. It's however the first med that is able to stabilize my mood very well with very acceptable side effects.",8,24
Abilify,"I'm not an easy patient, unsatisfied with the weight gain from the typical atypicals, lacking an 'oomph' from lithium, allergic to lamotrgine and anti-depressants give me a one way ticket to the manic rollercoaster.  I started Abilify and within 3 days I was hypermanic and nauseous to boot. No sleep, spending $400 on some bed sheets seemed like a marvellous idea, thrill seeking etc and throwing up every 3 hours.  However my psychiatrist guided me through it with sleep meds and something to settle the stomach and I'm so glad I pushed through.  Yeah, the restlessness is an issue but I'd like to consider myself an 'experience and going out' person now. Anything better than the listlessness of depression or meds that are supposed to cure it.",9,18
Abilify,"I have rapid-cycling bipolar and have been on Abilify for a little over 7-8 months. At first, I was on the Abilify by its self and I experienced worsened anxiety and depression. I was thinking about switching drugs after a few weeks of these negative feelings not going away, so my Pdoc added Zoloft to my mix. This combination was a life saver for me. I would definitely recommend using Abilify as an add-on. My mania is manifested as rage, impulsiveness, and rapid negative thoughts in my head and Abilify stopped that for me. The only negative side effect I have now is weight gain. I've only gained 8 pounds, but I have to ignore my food cravings.",8,13
Abilify,I took this med for 2 weeks.   Within 3 days I was in full thrown into full a total manic state.  I was awake every night by 3am because I couldn't sleep.  I spent quite a significant amount of money in a short amount of time!  I also put 4 pounds on in this time.  The only positive thing I can say is that it gave me energy.  The reason my pdoc tried me on it was depression and lack of energy.  I also have bipolar and have been on Lithium for 3 years and have been steady until I took Abilify. Needless to say I have stopped taking this med.,3,7
Abilify,"I have been on abilify for 6 weeks now and am still experiencing anxiety, agitation, constipation. I also feel sedated although I feel like I can't sit still.",5,14
Abilify,"I started Abilify because my bipolar disorder drug cocktail became less effective. Abilify was new on the market. It lifted my mood considerably, I felt great. And without any bad side effects. I thought.  After about 6 weeks I developed hand tremor. It got worse. My psychopharmacologist sent me to a neurologist who began treating me for a kind of tremor that's inherited. He did not believe it was due to Abilify- which now has a side effect listed as muscle movements that could become permanent. Naturally I stopped taking Abilify. So either the neurologist is right, and Abilify activated the tremor or I developed the permanent muscle movement side effect. Either way, I now have to take an anti-tremor drug.",1,10
Abilify,"Total Mania, could not sleep, monitored sleep showed never in REM sleep at all over an 8 hour period.  Anxious, increased Resp Rate, wide awake, no hunger, racking thoughts.   Unable to finally function at job related to no sleep.  This drug is horrid!",1,13
Abilify,"Diabetes, thoughts of self-destruction , compulsive behavior,no energy, etc",1,12
Abilify,Been on abilify for 4 months and had to go off.  It's a great medicine for bipolar.  I could tell when I missed a dose because I would flip out.  The down fall on why I went off was the weight gain.  I gained 30 pounds in 3 months with just snacking.  Dr told me it slows the metabolism down.  I think it stopped it.  So give it a try.,7,13
Abilify,"this was a terrible drug for me. I can't tell you any physical side affect because I stopped taking it immediately after a week. This drug made me scared to go to work. Every time I get ready for work this incredible fear about going to work would possess me. I would call my job and tell them am sick when I was actually afraid. I would have my aunt call my job for me to call out because I was afraid. I would try to bring courage to go to work but the closer I was to work the worse the fear would be. I called out 4 times in a row. I almost got fired. when I stopped taking it, it all went away.",1,12
Abilify,"i have very mixed feelings about this medication. i was given this for mood stability about a year before i was diagnosed bipolar.  it worked really fast. my mood was very stable. but at what cost? It started out with slurred speech and constant drowsiness. eventually that faded away and then it turned into perhaps the worst thing I've ever had to deal with called internalised restlessness. It is also called akathsia. If I die and go to hell, it would be  to the land of akathsia. I recommend this drug if you're lucky enough to not  experience akathsia. it works really fast. they tried to prescribe me congentin to help, it barely did.",3,11
Abilify,"This is one of the nastiest drugs i taken for bp. It gave me major depression,major anxiety,restlessness, and major mood swings. I wouldnt recommend this drug to my worse enemy.",1,13
Abilify,"I'd love to say this med was good for me. I can't. I've never had such an awful response to a medication.  After 1 week of being on it I began to experience odd sensations. My arms felt disconnected, I couldn't get comfortable.   At the 2 week mark I had to leave work two days in a row, customers were terrifying me, my pulse was 180!  By this time my anxiety slowly shot up so high I was paralyzed. I couldn't walk across the room. I literally was stuck in a chair. Everything was extremely terrifying. Just sitting I was afraid to move. Once I saw my dr, found out I had suffered a severe panic attack that sent me into an anxiety attack for TWO weeks!  I was ill for six months. Read the pamphlet with the drug , it lists SEVERE ANXIETY!",1,16
Abilify,I absolutely hated this drug. My thoughts cycled so fast and I became 100 times more paranoid than I already am. I wouldn't leave the house and even preferred my closet. It multiplied my OCD as well.,1,9
Abilify,Taking abilify about 10 years. Does cause weight gain and for myself no sexual desire.  The swings from manic to depression continue but are manageable.  Do not take yourself off this drug cold turkey.  Caused many psychotic episodes for me which disappeared when returning to the drug.  Sad movies no longer make me cry. Don't have great joyful moments either.  I don't stagger around like when I was on lithium.  I do have hypertension not always controlled by the 3 antihypertensive I'm taking.,7,9
Abilify,"This medicine at 5mg a day every day for a month was terrible. It made me have panic attacks and made me super paranoid, i was paranoid before but it made it even worse, would not recommend",1,12
Abilify,"I was first put on abilify in 2004. It is very effective, and has been the most useful medication for me. I have developed gallstones, have a fatty liver and have high triglycerides. It is definitely not because of my diet. I was a vegan for 23 years and I am very strict with what I eat. I now have to get my gallbladder removed and I think it has to do with taking psychiatric drugs over the years. It is well noted now that abilify causes gallstones, a fatty liver and high triglycerides. I have been in constant pain for three months and just now, after 12 years of taking abilify, may discontinue the use and start something new. Overall, for the mood disorder this was highly effective and useful in treating my bipolar depression.",7,18
Abilify,"Just 5 mg made me blow up like a balloon. It increased my anxiety and I experienced blurry vision. It may work for some, but not for me.",2,7
Abilify,Not the drug for me. It made me very jittery. Restless legs +++.,1,5
Abilify,I take abilify 15mg for voices and a mood stabilizer. I take it in the form of an injection and I've been on it for 7 months. It has dulled the voices drastically and stopped my severe mania. I am now able to think logically and the constant brain fog that I was suffering from has been lifted.I gave it 9 out of 10 because I still suffer from depression related to my ptsd. I currently am taking 20mg of Fluoxetine for my severe anxiety and depression.The only side effects I had from abilify was seeing faint flashes in the dark and slight tongue tremors. Other than that ablilify has worked wonders for me . I no longer experience mania and I am so grateful because I was extremely wild when I was manic.,9,18
Abilify,"This med sucks, anxiety level went up. Couldn't sleep couldn't concentrate. Can't spend quality time with my son. Yet to find the miracle drug.",0,9
Abilify,10 months on 5mg abilify + wellbutrin and lithium. Gained 15-18 pounds. Found out this week that Abilify causes weight gain and it's the culprit - not an injury I'd been blaming it on. And I'd blamed myself and started disordered eating out of desperation. It gets rid of my mood swings and crying for no reason. I feel generally good except foggy while at work where I do not enjoy being. Unmotivated at work. Moderately motivated in personal life - better than in years. Absolutely quitting this drug. Now for the withdrawal I wasn't aware of when I decided to take it... I think this is a dangerous drug for anyone who is prone to weight gain or diabetes. Can't believe my pdoc didn't say anything when I complained about weight gain last time.,5,14
Abilify,"I started taking Ability 15mg on June 17th and now its June 25th so I've been on it for 8 days.  On the 17th I was admitted into a mental hospital because of my bipolar and extreme anxiety.  I'm taking it at night along with: Divalproex(Depakote)750mg, Hydroxyzine(Vistaril)50mg, Trazodone(Desyrel)50mg, and Clonazepam(Klonopin)1mg It seems to be helping me along with the other medications.  So far I dont think I've had any side effects, knock on wood.  I definitely recommend this medication if you have bipolar but make sure you take it also with a mood stabalizer.  If you take it alone it can cause severe side effects.",8,10
Abilify,"Started taking abilify and I noticed my mood became nothingness. I didn't feel happy nor sad. I just felt nothing. Has anyone experienced the same things? Prior to the feelings of nothingness, the night before (after a took it), I started becoming manic then about an hour later, I started becoming suicidal. Took Benadryl and became calm and sleepy. My manic and depression episodes were usually on a day-to-day basis whereas when I took abilify, it shifted within an hour or so.  Also, the side effects were so bad I couldn't get out of bed. Felt very dizzy with headache, wanted to puke, heart rate was faster than usual, loss of appetite, and weak (very weak).",4,21
Abilify,"It's only been two weeks but Abilify 2mg, added to Wellbutrin 150mg, has been amazing. I was misdiagnosed for many years and it's sad to realize how much time was lost to my illness that wasn't being properly controlled. I'd only taken ADs until now. I experienced dramatic improvement within DAYS and continued relief from symptoms which often left me homebound and sobbing with no interest or ability to work or socialize, even perform minor chores and the anxiety became crippling.  Side effects include some vision issues and a spell of overwhelming fatigue a few hours after taking the med. Once that dissipates, I feel a lot of energy and am able to function very well. Fingers crossed for continued success. Much luck to all. There is hope.",9,28
Abilify,"I couldn't really tell whether it worked or not for Bipolar 1 Disorder.  I was on a few different medications at once:  Lamictal, Lorazepam (as needed), and for a brief time, Seroquel with the Abilify.  The dose was 5 mg since I was experiencing a mixed episode with some paranoid thoughts.  I didn't notice it being particularly helpful for depression.  Maybe there was some slight mood stabilization, but not enough for me to really feel relief.  I was taken off of it for this reason.  Also, even at 5 mg, it caused me some restlessness and a sensation similar to a headache.  It's expensive too.",4,7
Abilify,"I have taken Abilify for around 5-6 years. I initially was prescribed it at the age of 15 which is way too early in my opinion. However its had relatively few side effects, and has by and large helped me from my tendency to veare towards psychosis or extreme mood swings. Don't try and get off this drug on your own, it can have horrible consequences. I'm not totally sure what was the Abilify withdrawal and what was my illness, but I had some very extreme mania, that may have been a side effect of withdrawal. Overall Abilify is a very serious drug, don't take it lightly, and I wouldn't recommend it for depression. But it has helped me tremendously, and I don't have much else to say that is negative about it.",8,13
Abilify,"Taken abilify for 10 days for bipolar and bpd. I am sleeping well and the suicidal thoughts have vanished. However, I feel very low and incapable of fulfilling my responsibilities, ie medical appt, seeing my son. My partner prised me outside for a walk and I just sat on the ground for an hour  incapable of moving. It's not like me to not want  to  go out. Feel utterly useless. Due to see my psychiatrist  in another 10 days. The only advice I've had is to 'be strong'. However am simultaneously coming off quetiapine due to weight gain. I have not rated this medicine numerically as I am so confused. But personally I feel horrible. Better luck  to anyone trying this medicine!",0,12
Abilify,"I have only taken Abilify for about 2 weeks but it has been the best experience yet with meds. Very mild side effects that only lasted for 2 days. I wake up early with tons of energy and motivation. The thought of leaving the house during the day doesn't make me want to crawl in a hole. I have not had ONE depressing thought or episode and for someone with Bi Polar, that is AMAZING.",10,51
Abilify,"Took Abilify along with Lithium.  Abilify is very helpful for mania mood swings.  I also noticed that when voices or loud thoughts in my mind were disruptive, Abilify was able to remove those.  As most drugs, there were some side effects I did not like.  Abilify did cause me to feel a bit dazed or doped, which also caused sleepiness during the day.  It did not help me with depression, and seemed to contribute to it because of the sleepiness and dazed feeling.  However, this drug was effective with the mania, and handy to have is the loud thoughts or voices are a problem.",7,11
Abilify,"I'm 29 and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 22 years old. I had bipolar 1 but with abilify and lamictal, I now have bipolar 2. I forget a lot of things, have become lazy, have gained 25 pounds in a year, have low motivation, tired all the time and have been feeling depressed. I plan on not taking abilify anymore because I feel as if I've lost myself ... I don't feel unique.",3,18
Abilify,I take Abilify 2mg along with Wellbutrin 300mg as well and feel so much better. No side affects at all. I was on Risperidone which was AWFUL! I think this medication must work differently when taken with Wellbutrin because I noticed a big difference for the better!,9,21
Abilify,"Abilify is the only antipsychotic that works for me. The extreme hunger, lethargy, restlessness, and memory problems I had on other antipsychotics are nonexistent with abilify. I was in the middle of a severe depressive episode when I took it and it only took several weeks for me to be back to normal functioning. I sleep better, have more energy, and fewer mood swings. This medication is great. I find that it is more activating while other drugs in the same class like Zyprexa are more tranquilizing.",9,26
Abilify,"It worked so well for me, except for the weight gain. It worked perfectly for my mood accept that within the first 2 months I was on it I gained about 20 pounds. I kept on it because it worked so well and we played around with some other Meds that might have balanced it out but it was just not worth it, I ended up gaining about 30-40 pounds from the whole thing and I am a rather small person. I am now on Lamotrigine and it works perfectly. In all it worked out pretty well, just had some unpleasant side affects for me.",7,10
Abilify,This medication though helped...it was not worth the weight gain..it really wasn't. I took it a while back and it was not worth it.  I also found that it made me feel a little suicidal.,4,9
Abilify,"This medicine has done so much for me. I've had horrible mood swings for years and they just kept getting worse. I would also cry myself to sleep every night for years and years. I always felt irritated and annoyed with everything. I would yell and scream, get hyper and crash into a pile on the floor, be suicidal one minute and happy the next. I was all over the place. This medicine has done so much for me.",10,32
Abilify,"This medicine made me so sick. Every single night I took it (which was only 5 nights cause I was that sick) I was up tossing and turning, sweating meanwhile it was 5 degrees out, severe dry mouth - to the point I could barely talk, throwing up &amp; severe head aches.",1,11
Abilify,"This drug is horrendous. I spent a week in a psychiatric ward the year I was twenty, and they titrated it up to ten milligrams by the time I was let out. I was a complete zombie, exhausted all the time - could fall asleep anywhere, any time of the day - so anxious that I had to keep moving my body to function. Kept crossing and uncrossing my legs, wringing my hands, etc. I was so numbed out I simply didn't enjoy life. I don't know how I managed to not kill myself. This thing will wreck you.",1,17
Abilify,"Whilst taking Abilify,I had terrible insomnia. I never slept for more than 2 hours at a time. I reached te stage where I slept wherever I felt sleepy. I never slept in bed for the 6 months I took this horrible drug. I gained a lot of weight, probably due to the lack of sleep. Should have stopped sooner.",1,14
Abilify,I am a 48 year-old woman who has had bipolar I disorder since I was 12.  It hit me severely and I have had a very difficult time with it.  During one of the latest bouts I tried Abilify at 2 mg and definitely felt a bump up in my mood.  I was so so excited and totally would've stayed on it except my appetite increased to such a degree that I immediately started gaining weight.  Food was like crack - it became utterly and completely addictive.  I could not stop eating!  I would try and control it for a few days but I was utterly and totally unable to stop.  An improvement in mood was worth 10 pounds but at 13 pounds in 8 weeks and no stopping I had to stop.  Super disappointed.  It is the only medication where I felt immediate relief.,3,19
Abilify,"Took this for depression and bipolar, made my mood plummet to the point feeling absolutely nothing inside. Can't move, watch tv no enjoyment from anything. Horrendous medication.",1,16
Abilify,"I have taken abilify for almost a year now on and off because it makes me gain weight. I'm now on lamictal, but other than that I did a lot of research to make sure that the abilify is making me gain weight and IT IS!!!!! I gained almost 15 lb in 2 weeks and I could never stop eating. Other than that abilify didn't work for me long term only short term",5,10
Abilify,"I have been on Abilify on two separate occasions along with other medications to help with depression and bipolar. BOTH times was a disaster. This time I've tried to tough out the side effects (working on three months now) and I still can't deal with the way it makes me feel. I feel flat, tired, depressed, low motivation, worthless, hopeless. You name it. I see my doctor tomorrow And plan to demand stopping Abilify.",2,15
Abilify,"I love this medication, changed my life. I take with Wellburrin 300mg. Together they are very effective. Only side effect is dizziness at times when standing.",9,30
Abilify,Did nothing. Used for 2 months,1,5
Abilify,Ive been taking this med for about a month now. The only side effects that have really happened is light upset stomach and restless feelings during the day. I feel like I always need to be moving. Its not bad given some of the side effects ive experienced from other drugs this has to be the least problematic so far. My mood has become much better and the depression I started out with is gone. Although I have not had a manic phase yet I can't say how its treating those its only been a month. I would recommend this for bi polar probably combined with another medication to help with the restlessness and hard time sleeping.,8,16
Abilify,"I was on Abilify for just over 2 years. At first I was started at 5mg, then increased to 10mg and finally upped to 15mg. At 15mg the psychotic symptoms vanished, and it prevented almost all manic episodes. It did nothing for my depressive symptoms though.  I also developed terrible akathisia within a few months of reaching 15mg, and they didn't stop when we briefly tried going back down to 10mg. My legs bounced up and down every minute I was awake, I rocked backwards and forwards, I paced and one of my arms even trembled too. I couldn't read, eat with a knife and fork, and strangers would give me funny looks. I had akathisia for two years. Other than that I had no other side effects with this drug. No weight gain or tiredness.",6,14
Abilify,Best med. I have ever had for my bipolar. I was on many drugs but they made me a zombie. I couldn't wake up. It's tough when you have to work everyday. My Dr. put me on abilify and I'm a new person! Very Happy with the results. I have a life again!,10,32
Abilify,"My doc put me on Abilify 15mg after extreme weight gain on Seroquel.  I have never been affected by a medication like Abilify.  My first tablet made me very very ill.  I was constantly vomiting, I was weak and felt like my body was burning up from inside. I was sweating profusely and I was weak.  I contacted my doctor and was immediately taken off Abilify.  It works for some and for others not. It definitely did not work for me.  I have now been put onto Lamictin 25mg so tomorrow I take my first tablet.",0,9
Abilify,I think it works really good for an add on. And its a cute little pink pill.,8,8
Abilify,I am on 30 mg of Abilify plus Trazodone and Wellbutrin and have to say this combination seems to be what works best for me. I don't feel drugged up but able to function day to day at work and with my family. I experience no side effects with Abilify except possibly some hair loss (but it looks like most if not all those type of drugs do that). Other than that I am grateful this helps.,9,19
Abilify,I started abilify recently and it makes me restless like my mind is awake but my body is asleep but for the bipolar I feel so much better and like a new person. Besides the restlessness I love this pill.,8,15
Abilify,"After having to pay a but load out of pocket for this i slowly found out it was not for me. It put me in a hyper-manic state. Had to constantly be moving. Would wake up every morning at 7 am, when the sunlight started peaking in my room, regardless of what time I was finally able to pass out. And worst of all, it caused me to have problems using the restroom. No matter how hard I tried or what I did it made me not able to urinate. Some meds don't work on some people as they should.",2,10
Abilify,I have noticed since I have been on this medication I have become more happy and able to deal with my depression that I was suffering for a few days. I have noticed differences in my sleep pattern. I go back to bed earlier and I wake up early which can be a problem for me at times because I need lots of energy during the day to keep me going because I will get tired and depressed. My mood starts to slip after 3:00 which can be annoying.,8,17
Abilify,"I'm a 22 year old female, recently diagnosed with bipolar, I took this medication for a month and it was pure hell, made me an emotional wreck (never was emotional) crying out of nowhere, made my anxiety even worse, made me extremely tired, made me paranoid to the point where I thought I was going to die. Over all I have no positive notes to tell. Didn't work for me but hey everyone is different.",1,13
Abilify,"I am on a much higher dose than most others here, 10 mg. I do have bipolar illness, perhaps that is why my cocktail also includes 400 mg lamictal and 25 mcg cytomel. I am stable after eight years with this combo. I still have manic episodes, but much more manageable, thank god! What is also nice is that the abilify is available as a generic drug. Beforehand it was $80/ month, even with excellent insurance. Worth a try!",7,9
Abilify,I've been 4 months on this drug and it wiped out my depression. It started to work after 1 week of usage. I gained 14 Kgs and a little bit manic (but supressed by depakote). I love this abilify it saved my life,9,21
Abilify,"I was VERY hesitant on taking this medication, and like most of you reading these reviews, I too was scared of what it might or might not do. All I can say, in 3 days (2mg dose) there was a huge difference in my attitude, calmness and overall presence in me and my thoughts.  Amazing!!!!  I have so much energy and love doing things again.  It has been one week, and for those of you who are affraid to gain weight; you must know, I am losing weight.  It has actually decreased my apitite, however that might be because I am cautious of it and find other ways to curb cravings.   One side effect I am having is NOT sleeping, although we are going through a bit of a heat wave and even air conditioning is not helping.  Good Luck!",9,32
Abilify,"I took Abilify for a month and it was not for me. It first made me happy, but it made me too happy! I became manic again and couldn't settle myself down. I would be up at 2 am working out or cleaning. Also, the side effects were awful! My hands never stopped shaking and people began to think I had a drinking problem due to the way they were shaking. It also made me gain 5 lbs within a week. Not a fan.",3,19
Abilify,"Within 1 hr of taking - starting shaking uncontrollably, threw up and couldn't sleep",1,14
Abilify,"Since Abilify was added to my bipolar cocktail, I have had only minor manic episodes.  I have been on it now for 4-5 years.  I would highly recommend it to anyone!  Thanks for giving my a much more stable life Abilify!",10,19
Abilify,I've been taking Abilify 30mg per day for 8 years. I have not had a major episode since and no hospitalization. Great for maintenance of mania and rapid cycling.,10,28
Abilify,"After five months in 11-12 year old male, no noticeable side effects and works very well at reducing mania. (7.5mg)",10,12
Abilify,"I am 40. I was diagnosed bipolar 15 years ago. My mania manifests itself as aggression/rage. My rage has been a problem since I was young. My violent outbursts consisted of me punching myself, bashing my head against walls and other horrifically embarrassing and dangerous actions. I was extremely verbally abusive to anyone unfortunate enough to be near me during my rages. I have been on many meds throughout my life. Every benzo. Mellaril. Thorazine. Every SSRI. Depakote. Lithium. NOTHING curbed my rage. In fact - SSRI meds INTENSIFIED my rage. 10 years ago, my psychiatrist put me on 20mg of Abilify. Within 4 days - I felt like I could finally breathe. My rage literally disappeared. But I don't feel zombie-ish like with other meds.",9,70
Abilify,Love it!,8,14
Abilify,"I have bipolar 1 and started this medication to help with breakthrough symptoms while on a mood stabilizer.  Within the first few hours I knew this wasn't the right medication for me.  I was so anxious inside, I felt as if my blood was crawling around beneath my skin. After two days of taking it I knew that if I stayed on it, I would be at risk of suicide to stop that horrible feeling.  Taking it made me stay awake for two days, fretting with anxiety.  I spoke to my doctor the first chance I got and she immediately took me off of it.  I'm on other medications now and very stable for years.",1,22
Abilify,"I'm on Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal. In ten years this combination is the only one that has worked. While it took some tweaking it is well worth it. Two side effects, constipation and eye rolling.",9,24
Abilify,"Abilify changed my life. There is hope. I was on Zoloft and Clonidine when I first started Abilify at the age of 15.. Zoloft for depression and Clondine to manage my complete rage. My moods were out of control. I was depressed and hopeless one second and then mean, irrational, and full of rage the next. My Dr. prescribed me 2mg of Abilify and from that point on I feel like I have been cured though I know I'm not.. Bi-polar disorder is a constant battle. I know Abilify works for me because I have tried to get off it and lost complete control over my emotions. Went back on it and I was golden again.  I am on 5mg 2x daily. I am now 21 and better than I have ever been in the past. Only side effect is I like to eat a lot.",10,33
Abilify,"Day one: TERRIBLE!  Very tired, had to stay home from work Day two: Getting better.  Very tired in morning but the day improved Day three: Wonderful!  I am not sure what normal is, but if this is it, I am in heaven.  Awake, focused, appropriate amount of energy, easy going mood, less irritable and lower anxiety (could be the xanax on the last one). I am just beginning the medication but typically meds have a quick affect on me and stick.  I have not noticed any unusual appetite increases but I am certainly going to keep an eye on it because I noticed a large percentage experiences weight gain.  As my fiance says- mental health is more important than gaining a few pounds anyway.",10,45
Abilify,"Desperately trying to get back on Abilify, but insurance is awful. My suicidal thoughts are back. The Abilify balanced me out and I could sleep while on it. (It's almost 5am, and I haven't slept yet.)",10,27
Abilify,"I am a 28 year old female diagnosed with Bipolar 1, Generalized Anxiety Disoder, Panic disorder and Agoraphobia. A little over a week of taking this medication in conjunction with Lamictal and a benzo (Xanax, Klonopin, or Valium depending upon doc's decision) I felt like a million bucks. I could leave the house. I had a normal sleep schedule. I had energy for the first time in a long time. It was a miracle for me. Stopped taking it and downward I went again. Restarting now and I couldn't be more excited. I will say it made me feel restless and that includes Restless Leg Syndrome types of feelings. But, I would rather be restless and functioning. You have to weigh the pros and cons --for me it is a PRO!",9,75
Abilify,"Abilify worked pretty good for five years with Prozac.  But then I became morbidly obese, with elevated bad lipids and prediabetes.  Also, I was constantly in fear of tardive dyskinesia.  I no longer take it.",5,25
Abilify,"I'm a 21 year old female and just diagnosed with Bipolar I. It's been a roller coaster ride especially after gaining 10 pounds in the hospital while taking risperidone and Depakote. I'm still on the Depakote, though I hope to discontinue it as soon as my psychiatrist allows, but I just switched to Abilify. I've got to say, so far I have no complaints. With risperidone I had no lid to my hunger. It was endless, and that was quite disappointing. There were many other side effects, but the weight gain has added to my self loathing. Though the painful heart dysrhythmias are a close second. I'm hoping that Abilify makes it possible for me to curb my appetite back to what it used to be as I exercise the 30 pounds I don't need away.",7,31
Abilify,This has helped extremely with my bad mood swings and irritability but am having nightmares and waking up multiple time during the night feeling restless.,5,39
Abilify,Have been on Abilify for two weeks and my personality has changed drastically. I went from being chilled out and quite okay on Seroquel and Effexor but wanted to try Abilify to combat weight gain. In the two weeks I've been on it I've swung from hypomanic to aggressive and downright selfish. I did things I wouldn't normally do that has hurt my relationship with my partner and I've also been spending like crazy. Probably should stop but will consult psychiatrist first to see what she says.,1,36
Abilify,No effect after 3 months on it.,1,13
Abilify,"I've been taking Abilify for eight months now. Although it made me gain 15-20kg (something like 33-40 lbs I believe?), my experience is quite positive. The sadness from my major depressive episode, as well as my suicidal thoughts, have been almost annihilated. The reason why I rated it as a six is because it didn't help ease the great fatigue I have. But it helped a lot, that is for sure.",6,37
Abilify,"So many negative side effects. This interacts HORRIBLY with THC, especially as the THC wears off, and exponentially exacerbates the intensity and length of any depressive come-down effects. In my experience it  interacts with alcohol in about the same way. Also it can make women in-orgasmic.",2,20
Abilify,"I was ready to walk out on my husband because of his hateful stressful presence. I sent him to the doctor and he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started on Abilify. It was a lifesaver for our marriage and family. He is happy, fun, and hopeful again. I thank God my prayers were answered.",10,89
Abilify,Gained 60 lbs in under 9 months while taking this.,1,15
Abilify,"I took Abilify for one month. I had restlessness, a feeling that I needed to do something. It was a good thing in a way. At first I was more irritable but that subsided substantially after a few days. It made me feel a lot more calmer and in control of my emotions without making me feel like I was suppressing them. This is the first pharmaceutical medicine I have tried to treat my condition and it definitely worked better than the natural remedies such as St John's Wort, same, and passion flower. It even helped more than meditation. I have just switched to Latuda because Abilify gave me chest pains. If the pain was anywhere else I would of definitely stayed on the medicine because it worked. It helped me gain 10 lb which is good for me.",8,25
Abilify,"I like Abilify a lot because I used to be extremely irritable. I also couldn't ride my bicycle when I was manic because I would not focus on my safety. Luckily, I now only get hypomanic episodes thanks to Abilify. I feel like I am free to get off of my emotional roller coaster and explore the world outside. The only few problems it gave me were akasthesia and weight gain. I'm 14 years old, and I don't know whether I gained 40 lbs from growing, the medicine, or both.",7,26
Abilify,"Started on Abilify in addition to Effexor and Lamictal.  Immediately had tremors in hands, lips and speech.  Gained weight and was anxious.  Stopped taking when I ran out; tremors stopped, lost weight and no noticeable negative consequences.  Don't know why it was prescribed but it caused more problems than it helped.  Side effects were terrible.",1,36
Abilify,"I am diagnosed bi-polar and I have tried Lamictal, Lithium, Latuda and I don't even know how many other combinations. Abilify was the only one that has shown results for me. Yes, it tends to make me tired about 4-5 hours after taking it. And it makes me eat like a piggy sometimes, which has caused some weight gain. But nothing to severe. I take 5mg in the morning and 5mg at night, perfect dose for me. It keeps my moods perfectly balanced but I have been taking Abilify since I was 15 and I am now 20 and do not plan on stopping it anytime soon. I have tried that and it did not end well.",9,52
Abilify,"I have tried many bipolar, mania medicines with none being the right one, however when my doctor prescribed Abilify it helped majorly in my life. I am on a combination of Abilify, Divalproex and Trazadone. All of which work in my favor. It is very comforting to know there is a medicine out there that understands bipolar patients.",10,36
Abilify,This medicine did not work for me.  I suffer from Bipolar with mood swings and panic disorder.  I went up to 10mg and It seemed to help my mood but it pushed my anxiety off the charts. I was a shaky mess while taking it and also unable to focus and complete tasks.  Went off within 4 weeks.,3,30
Abilify,"This medicine made me nervous all the time, I was a wreck, I could never sit still. It took away the mania and psychosis but left me suicidal and depressed so my psychiatrist stopped it.",5,20
Abilify,"Abilify is not for everyone. I experienced severe personality change within a month. The story:  I have had bipolar disorder since I was 13 and have been in treatment for 9 years. When Abilify came out, we tried Abilify to bridge getting me off atypical antipsychotics and onto a mood stabilizer.  The 20 day experience was horrible. My personality changed radically. I didn't know myself anymore. Friends, my lover, my boss, all begged me to stop. I felt weird on it, not better. Severe personality changes are possible with Abilify. I called my psych, we stopped the medicine and moved onward. Those 20 days were destructive, but my friends &amp; job were kind and life returned to normal.",1,46
Abilify,I feel the Abilify working on my depression. I am singing and happier then I have been in a while. I was taking Invega before and that did not help me at all. I am diagnosed with Bipolar 1. This medicine has lessened my mania but has not vanished it completely. I do not see any side effects with this medicine!,10,40
Abilify,"Today is my first day taking the medication and within two hours I am ready to pass out. I feel so sleepy and its not really regulating my moods. In fact, I'm more aggravated than usual and going off on everybody. I also feel slightly nauseous and dizzy.",1,35
Abilify,I was diagnosed as bipolar type II and my nurse practitioner in WA prescribed me abilify and I gained 30lb within a month of taking it. I blew up like a balloon and he said he doesn't have that side effect. I looked online and it says that it clearly does. He said to take it a few more weeks and see how I did. I gained ten more pounds and my mother insisted I stop taking it. I went from 148 to 188lb. It may have started helped with my symptoms but I was to concerned about my weight gain so he finally put me on Topamax.,2,30
Abilify,I feel really good using this medicine for bipolar and depression.,8,38
Abilify,"Abilify was fine at first, but it slowly increased my anxiety to the point where I felt like I was stuck in one long, never ending panic attack. I stopped Abilify two days ago and feel so much better.",2,37
Abilify,I started taking and was fine for a few weeks. Then I started gaining weight slowly. Before I knew it I had gained 40 pounds in 6 months.,1,40
Abilify,I found out I was bipolar about a month ago. The first pill my PCP gave me was Abilify. Starting on 2mg for the first 2 weeks. I didn't notice anything until maybe the third day. However the rest of that week and the following I have been on a roller coaster. I just started taking 5mg of Abilify and I notice the next day. I had the feeling of being normal again. Only side effect I've notice was when I was depressed I was depressed. Since upping the dose I feel way better.,6,31
Abilify,"This medicine has been a game changer for me. I stopped stress eating and lost weight, my mood stabilized and I have been incredibly productive and achieved great things on it. It does wonders for my anxiety. I have been on it for a year and could not be happier with the product. It is expensive but WORTH it! Highly recommend.",10,74
Abilify,"This is what I've always needed. My mood is lifted, I have energy I never had before, I don't feel sad and helpless anymore, my anxiety has lessened and I'm easier to get along with. This may just save my failing marriage. I was afraid of all the side effect warnings but I only experienced mild nausea for about a week, and for the first few days I woke up intermittently during the night, but could easily fall asleep again almost immediately.  Feeling so much better!",10,62
Abilify,"I have only been taking Abilify (along with my Prozac) for 2 days. So far I have had many ups and downs. I wake up feeling shaky and out of sorts. I have trouble breathing and black out a lot. (I black out anyways, but it has increased). Then I go through a period of anxiety and sweating. A little while later I go through severe nausea and then extreme fatigue. Between each phase I feel pretty great, but it's short lived. I'm going to give it more time, but that's the initial reaction for me.",7,16
Abilify,I've used several bipolar medications.  This has the least side effects.,10,41
Abilify,Got put on 15mg of Abilify in the hospital and it has been the best antipsychotic I've taken! My anxiety is pretty much gone and there was a big difference in my mood swings.,0,40
Abilify,It works well for me.,10,21
Abilify,"I was recently diagnosed at age 24 with Bipolar disorder (some paranoid features) co-morbid with Asperger's disorder. I have woken up in the morning all my life in an absolute rage, and my Bipolar has affected my life in more ways than I care to mention. I wish I would've known about my mental illness sooner- I thought everyone felt like I did. I have been on this medicine for a week, and for once in my life I wake up in a good mood, I stay in a good mood during the day, and am generally happy. I am extremely productive instead of either too manic or too depressed to function. The only bad thing is the akathesia, but worth it.",10,58
Abilify,"It's not for everyone, but I do well on it. It's a great antidepressant, and it helped me lose a lot of weight, I believe. Only downside- insomnia! But it does go away, eventually (the insomnia).",9,32
Abilify,"I would hide at home for months, shaking when a telephone rang. I couldn't let people go and had obsessive thoughts. Abilify gave me calm, confidence and hope. It made me less sensitive to light and time, I was no longer at the mercy of each passing moment. I woke up relaxed, went to bed without a noise in my head, inner voices stopped criticizing me, thoughts didn't race. I was creative but focused, and began wonderful new projects. Had NO side effects- NO weight gain. 'Worked magic that first day. But after a month it seemed to do nothing but make me sad. Evidently that was a manic phase. It blocks my mania, but not my depressive switch. Feels like I've traded manic depression for unipolar depression. I am being switched to lithium.",6,42
Abilify,"I WAS on Abilify for more than a year. then it got prohibitively expensive. (over $250) I was on 15mg. It made my rage and aggression more manageable. I think this is a MIRACLE pill. The only side affect that DIDN'T go away, was the restless leg syndrome. If you can afford this medicine, take it, it's GREAT.",8,52
Abilify,"This pulled me right out of the zombie state the mood stabilizer   antidepressant combination had put me in. I still have swings, but they're not as deep or as long, and my mania is still stifled enough that it's productive rather than destructive.",10,50
Abilify,"Loving it so far, seems to be giving me a life. I am a single mom who struggles with bipolar polar everyday and has been on almost everything and combo of things out there with no success. The only problems I've noticed so far are nausea, dizziness, and being extremely tired throughout the day. I have only been on the medicine for a short period of time so I'm hoping these side effects will start to go away but compared to what I normally deal with, they are nothing. The big issue is I do not have insurance so my doctor is currently giving me samples. I'm trying to qualify for the financial assistance program but if I don't I won't be able to take the medication.",7,29
Abilify,"I was prescribed Abilify 15mg in addition to Depakote 1g daily for bipolar affective disorder and my mood was stabilised but it wad constantly low and on the edge. I was heavily sedated that I slept 15 hours a day and when I was awake I didn't feel 'completely there', and I also had blurred vision. I was taken off the Abilify and put onto Quetiapine and was more alert and my vision improved, so in my case Abilify really didn't suit me.",4,33
Abilify,"Abilify helped me at the maxed out dose of 30mg. I noticed that it made my manic episodes be more contained, however, when I was depressed it dragged me down deeper. I actually was suicidal. It was a real painful thing since usually my manic episodes are a lot worse.",5,16
Abilify,"Puerperal Psychosis: Makes me feel hungrier than usual but has given me much more energy than other medicines such as Seroquel, Risperidal and Zyprexa (all of which I have tried previously).  Glad to get a chance to try Ablify at last.  Seems to curb the delusions and hallucinations too.",8,14
Abilify,"I have been taking Abilify for nearly two years to manage my episodes of rage.  The medication helps me to talk myself down in circumstances that I would usually build on my ridiculous ideas.  It is a miracle medicine for me.  Last month when the price went up to $120 dollars I decided to try and manage without it since I am also on a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant.  That was a bad idea.  After about 9 days I started noticing my episodes of rage increasing and I also started feeling more social anxiety.  My husband requested that I begin taking the Abilify again, and after just a couple days I was back to my normal self.  I take 15 mg at bedtime.  Although the cost is high, it is worth it to keep my sanity.",10,49
Abilify,"I've been on Abilify for nearly 2 years.  The first month or so was rough (tired early at night or after a cocktail, restless sleep, waking up early, dizziness, foggy head), but after my Dr. reduced my dose to 2.5 mg/day, side effects improved.  The ones that remain are profuse night sweats (SOAKED sheets) and constipation.  It does make you a bit tired, but I take it before bed.  It completely helped with my irritation/agitation towards people and my children.  I have a ton more patience and less anxiety overall.  The biggest issue I have is the cost. Get the Abilify Savings card if you are starting a new prescription!",8,33
Abilify,I have had no suicidal thoughts since I've been on this medicine. It is an awesome medicine.,10,26
Abilify,"Abilify gave me total erectile dysfunction, spasms. It made me fatigued even if I took it at night but at the same time it made me feel quite agitated inside. I was only on this medication for a month so I cannot say whether it controlled my symptoms effectively. It may work for some, however the side effects were unbearable for me.",2,12
Abilify,"I'm 38 and have been suffering from bipolar and some schizophrenia since age 12. First time in my life that a pill other than a painkiller took away the crushing pressure pinning my dreams, my soul, to the ground.",10,52
Abilify,"This medicine works well for me and I tried a lot of medicines. It's a little pill, does a lot. People have said I seem much better and have my personality back (I was on lithium, made me like a zombie). Hardly any side effects. I take it with Lamictal. A",10,40
Abilify,"I've just finished my first week on Abilify, and although I've been told that the med is ready to do its job from the 2nd or 3rd day you take it, I don't think my brain chemistry has settled down to one reaction. Right now, I'm pleased. I have Bipolar Type 2, and Abilify was prescribed to help with my constant depression. Now I am going back and forth between a little anxious and mildly manic, sometimes in one day. This is a huge improvement. I have energy! I can smile! Hope this is permanent",8,32
Abilify,It made me very agitated.,1,17
Abilify,"Has significantly reduced my mania and irritability.  I'm much more stable.  Has also reduced my need for alcohol, which I used frequently to medicate.  I've been on several medicines for bipolar and this one seems to work for me. Started at 2mg. at night and worked up to 10mg, (5th day at 10mg.) and feel much more in control.  My insomnia is gone too. I haven't gained any weight but was on Risperdal (gained 10 pds.) can't seem to lose that weight. Since I've decided to quit drinking maybe I'll lose the weight.",10,28
Abilify,"Have been taking Abilify for 6 months at 2 mg daily. The first 2 weeks were hard I couldn't sit still at all and could not sleep and my work suffered badly because I couldnt think due to lack of sleep, but I didn't give up because the anger and extreme anxiety I was experiencing disappeared after the first dose! I have gained weight and sometimes cannot control binge eating since I've been on it.  Also it does almost nothing for depression which still comes and goes but is easier to deal with since I have much less anxiety symptoms but I seem I be really paranoid now and I don't like that. All that being said I feel way more stable on this than on nothing.",0,14
Abilify,"I just started this medicine and I feel great already from switching off Seroquel XR to Abilify. I take 2.5mg (split 5mg pill) in the morning and my moods are a lot more stable. I'm also more productive at everything like work, house work, etc. My loved ones can see the difference. The first two days I experienced some nausea but that's it! I feel the biggest thing is start at a low dose.",10,24
Abilify,It seemed to work well but I developed akathesia on this medicine. I took it for a few months.  I felt like I could not sit still.  I had to keep moving.  I could not enjoy anything.  I also had trouble sleeping.  I tried lowering the dosage then we tried increasing the dosage but nothing helped.  I finally had to stop taking it because of the side effects.,4,18
Abilify,"Starting on day two of treatment I felt progressively sicker with mild nausea, muscle aching and general malaise.",1,12
Abilify,"I have been on Abilify for three weeks now.  I also take Klonopin, Celexa, and Trileptal for bipolar II disorder.  The Abilify was added to control my anger and aggression, because sometimes I just wanted to SNAP!  I feel much better now.  So far I've only lost weight because it makes me feel queasy and kills my appetite in general.  However, I give it an 8 because it costs a small fortune to be on this medication ($600 a month since I no longer have insurance). It's made my insomnia worse too. Overall though as long as it doesn't make me gain weight it still rates high on my scale.",8,17
Abilify,"I have had emotional disorders all my life.  I am 48 years old.  I've always been taking something most of my adult life.  I recently went off Lithium (after 2 years of 900 mg/day) and was put on Abilify.  Wow.  It's only been 3-4 days of taking it and I can tell a big difference.  Taking 1/2 10 mg for 2 weeks then the whole 10 mg after that.  I also take Prozac 40 mg/day.  Thyroid medicines, blood pressure medicines and 2 mg clonazepam to sleep.  I am surprised this Abilify has put energy in me so quick.",9,20
Abilify,"I have been on Abilify for almost a year now after having a starting to go into a manic episode. Abilify helped very quickly for me and kept me from going full blown mania. It also has stabilized my moods very well, however the down side is I have gained tremendous amounts of weight while on this 50lbs in the first 6 months with 34 more lbs in the following months. My regular MD told me it was the Abilify after doing some test for other things, and advised me to get off this. I can't afford to gain anymore weight and I am hoping that getting off this takes care of that, but I also hope I will remain stable. Good luck if you need this take it, but be aware of increased hunger and weight gain.",5,21
Abilify,"Abilify has enabled me to control some of my anxiousness and reactions due to being anxious better than I had been able to before.  I no longer want to smack someone who I feel is doing me wrong - I am able to control those impulses so much better than before, it is not even funny.  I think on a day to day basis, I am much more even keeled than I was before I started taking the medication.  Keep in mind that I take it with an antidepressant (Lexapro) because I understand that Abilify provides an assist to the Lexapro in controlling my overwhelming depression symptoms.  Depression and anger are now being controlled more effectively.",9,28
Abilify,"I took 10mg for about 6 months although initially I felt less manic, my muscles in my legs ached and I started to lose my zest to do anything. My whole outlook on life seemed to be dead but not in a depressed way. I stopped taking Abilify and gradually I started to return back to the creative person I have always been. I still take a mood stabiliser (topirimate) to control my mania and Prozac to stop my depressive moods. Abilify was just a step too far for me to handle, I don't want to be a zombie.",3,20
Abilify,"I am on 2mg of Abilify now. Went up to 4 mg but was too tired all day, could not function. 2mg a day of Abilify along with 250 mg of Zoloft and 7.5 Zyprexa works extremely well for me. It helped mostly for my depression and gave me my energy back. Sleep great and no side effects (as long as I don't take more than 2 mg of Abilify). If you are suffering, talk to your doctor about trying Abilify. I started very slowly with the dosing.",8,17
Abilify,I've been taking Abilify 30 mg for about 4 years now. I also take 2 antidepressants Paxil 40mg and Wellbutrin 300mg daily. Abilify changed my life for the better. I had been on a roller-coaster of medicines taking Seroquel for a few years. When I tried Abilify I barely had side effects though for the first month I had excessive sweating. I have gained 70 pounds since I began taking medicines (8 years). Recently I was taken off Abilify to try Lithium. I became severely depressed and manic. I even went to the ER for suicide. The few times I've been off my medicines I've been hospitalized. So I say definitely YES to Abilify.,9,16
Abilify,Has helped very well with the depression and does a good job balancing things out so I don't often have a really low low or a very high high.,8,13
Abilify,"1st day on Abilify seemed like I had energy. 2-3 days later insomnia set in big time. Even tried taking 2 Lunesta...didn't work.  2 weeks later, I was in the ER from side effects. Tremors, not comfortable in my own skin, slurred speech, couldn't focus or concentrate.  Spouse thought I'd had a stroke.  They gave me Ativan and Benadryl.  I got a new Psychiatrist after that. Just starting on Lithium now.  We'll see.",1,15
Abilify,"This medication worked so well for my bipolar, no side effects except for dizziness when I forgot to take a dose.  Had to stop taking it because I no longer have insurance and couldn't afford $600 per month for one medication.  Wish I could afford to go back on it.",10,13
Abilify,"I know every medication works different on each person. But Abilify worked great for the first few months. I felt like my old self again. I took 10mg once a day but over the course of 1.5 years my blood pressure went up (never had a problem with it before it had always been perfect), all my cholesterol levels skyrocketed, my glucose levels went up, my muscles begin to get tight, I GAINED 50lbS too, and the worse part was the i was beginning to have more up-n-down moments and depression.",5,15
Abilify,"The first day when I woke up I felt like my body had been hit by a mack truck! But the second day, my body felt fine. It took about 2 weeks for side effects to go away (trouble sleeping, headache, stomach upset). The motivation has been wonderful. I take it with Wellbutrin and Lamictal. I never wanted to try it because of the weight gain but I have not found that to be true. In my case motivation = exercise.",10,19
Abilify,"I had such bad side effects from Abilify with no positive effects. My cholesterol went up, I had heartburn or acid reflux every night that would wake me up. I got totally paranoid and was even scared to drive or ride in a car. I had unusual fears of dying, I had a hard time laying still and would have to move my legs and arms. I got really bad dizzy spells usually while I was driving,, which created more fears of driving. I still haven't found something that works for me. Losing hope.",1,12
Abilify,"I love this medicine. I have bipolar II disorder, and this medicine does everything it's supposed to do. It keeps my manic moods completely in check, and works very well in conjunction with Zoloft. I have been on both drugs for years, and I have not had any serious depression or mania for over 20 years! The only side effect that I experience is fatigue, but so worth it. The side effects are minimal. I feel and act NORMAL.",10,37
Abilify,I have been on Abilify for 5 years. I take 15 mg. Abilify has changed the quality of my life for the better. I take this pill when I can't sleep.,8,14
Abilify,"I have tried just about every Bipolar Medicine there is out there and then some.   I am completely satisfied with this medicine.  All of the others had terrible side effects.  Neurontin, Zyprexa, Lithium, Tegretol, you name it I've tried it.  It is very hard to get someone who is bipolar to take medicines due to the fact there are so many side effects.  In my opinion Abilify does what is says it supposed to do with no side effects.  Of course everyone is different.  This medicine works.  It keeps me from going high or low.  Most bipolar patients should probably be on an antidepressant, which is only my opinion since everyone is unique.",10,37
Abilify,"When I first was put on Abilify I thought I wouldn't be able to take it. I constantly had to move my feet. I developed restless leg syndrome. I hung in there and kept taking it. After a couple weeks had passed, the restless leg stopped. I have now been stable on Abilify for 4 years now. My mood swings are non-existent now. I don't have the emotional ups and downs that I used to. However, I have gained 34 pounds since starting this medicine. My doctor would like me to switch to Geodon, in hopes of losing the Abilify weight. I am scared to switch since I've done so well on the Abilify. But I must lose some weight and get my cholesterol down, since Abilify also raises cholesterol. Besides the weight gain, I've been thrilled with Abilify.",9,25
Abilify,"So far the best medication for bipolar disorder I've taken.  I started out successfully at 20mg for a year.  Then I developed twitching on the left side of my body.  My doctor reduced my dosage to 2 mg a day and put me on Artane.   I am glad I found this medicine because I don't have to take it daily and I no longer feel as if I'm going insane.  Helpful, but you really need to pay attention to the way your body handles it. My twitching has gone away thankfully.",8,16
Abilify,"Only been taking Abilify for 3 weeks. Seems okay so far but craving sweet things so worried about any weight gain though none so far, also hard to concentrate for too long.",9,6
Abilify,"I had a metabolic reaction-severe. In less than a month I gained 20lbs and my cholesterol was raised to a high level. I have always had low cholesterol, so my psychiatrist took me off of it.",2,10
Abilify,"While on abilify I felt normal and happy.  Although I did gain some weight, I was still happy with the medicine.  I am having to go off it though due to history of diabetes in family and the doctor has told me that my sugar levels are getting high and going towards diabetes.  Also I am not sure but I have developed a swallowing problem which I never had and I know that if you have a swallowing problem before starting you should discuss with your doctor so I am just thinking that this has caused it.  Still looking into this though.  I do recommend this to everyone who can try it.",7,12
Abilify,"I've been on Abilify for about 3 weeks, along with trazadone for insomina and anxiety, and tapering off Paxil. I've noticed a significant improvement in controlling my emotions, and for the most part am a lot calmer. Suffered some side effects such as restlessness, and the shakes but overall the positives outweigh the negatives. I started off on a very low, 2.5 mg, dose but expect to have this raised at my next appointment with the Doctor.",7,13
Abilify,Have used Abilify for about 18 months and it has helped me in all aspects. Can focus and can control the racing thoughts and mania attacks. It helps with the outburst and have lost weight.,9,31
Abilify,"I have experienced more rapid cycling with this medication, major insomnia and then sleepiness.  Also, I have experienced shortness of breath and higher blood pressure.  However it helps in making oneself quite groggy for half a day.",6,13
Abilify,I had severe tardive dyskinesia due to this medication within a few doses of taking it.,1,18
Abilify,"I took Abilify for a year for treatment of bipolar disorder.  Towards the end, I was getting Parkinsonian symptoms and had to stop taking it.  Also was having hand tremors and feet tremors.",5,19
Abilify,Stopped my mixed episode very quickly!,9,16
Abilify,"So far, Abilify seems to be the one drug that has worked for me. My mood is much more stable and I have actually been feeling good for the first time in a long time. One good side effect is that it has caused me to lose weight. I really don't have much of an appetite anymore. At the beginning I had quite a bit of nausea but that has passed. A negative side effect I have been experiencing is sleepiness. It is almost to the point where I can't function during the day because I am so tired. My doctor recently cut my dose in half so I am hoping that does the trick.",8,24
Abilify,"After a few days and it kicked in, every noise in the house would make me jump, pictures on TV would feel as if they were 3-D and make me jump, and I literally felt like my skin was crawling, moving, and melding to things, such as blankets. My mind focused and keyed in on every piece of white noise there was and I had sweaty, night hot flashes with chills.",1,29
Abilify,Good for depression. Akathisia was horrible!,4,14
Abilify,"I was not warned by my doctor in advance that Abilify can lower your BP. I fainted regularly and could not drive for about 1 week, until they got me off of it again. It seemed to help with my mood, but unfortunately, I couldn't live with the side effect of passing out all the time!",7,22
Abilify,Took Abilify for 4 days.  Had nausea for those 4 days and several days after I stopped taking it.  I also have a twitch in my lower lip that is still there 7 months later.,1,14
Abilify,Very good medicine for treating symptoms but very difficult to discontinue usage.,8,9
Abilify,"I took 10 mg tabs in the morning for like two and a half weeks.  It had me believing in myself again.  Almost manic like.  Thinking I'm a genius, maybe I am.  So also my emotions are deeply repressed, like I don't ever cry.  After taking Abilify though, it seemed I was consciously aware of my own duality and that my emotions and thoughts are separate.  Now that I'm on Abilify I can switch between what I want.  Emotion, or thought.  That's new for me.  Then the side effects stopped me cold.  Akinithesia or whatever hit me bad.  Physical tiredness.  Stopped taking it.",7,25
Abilify,My mother has taken this medicine for her bipolar and it does seem to help her out a lot with her condition. I'm glad there is research out there for the bipolar disorder because I think it's very important to people to have information on it.,5,11
Abilify,"It did wonders for my mood, HOWEVER I was NOT told of the risks involved. And the positive did NOT outweigh the negative in this case. After only a month, I developed Atrodystrphy and my legs hurt badly. I can't sit still, I pace, I cry, ...anything to get the pain to stop. My pysch said it was from the Abilify. I'm now on Geodon and praying this isn't permanent. PLEASE be informed before taking this medication!",1,46
Abilify,"I was on this medication for a few years and it worked wonders on my mood.  I can get moody very quickly and while taking this medication, mood swings were rare.  Unfortunately, I began suffering from body tremors and had to stop taking it.  My hands would shake uncontrollably and my head actually shook back and forth.  I didn't notice it but when I would talk to my sister, she would tell me that my head was rapidly shaking back and forth.  That is why I rated this a 9 instead of a 10.",9,24
Abilify,"Abilify caused weight gain in my instance - I gained 10 kg, which is a lot for someone that was once petite. I lost all my confidence. I have been battling with Bipolar for years and never have I been on such an ineffective drug. I think it should just be taken off the market.",1,22
Abilify,I was given this drug and I started having pains all up and down my spine. I continued the drug because of my psychiatrists insistence that it wasn't caused by the drug. Months later I started having problems with paranoia and insomnia. I ended up in the hospital because I was almost suicidal and they took me off the medicines. All the side effects just melted away after that.,1,38
Abilify,"This made me very angry and loss of hair, hostile and wanting to hurt myself.",1,26
Abilify,"Took a half of a pill for three days and felt like someone beat the life out of me. I could not sit, stand, breathe, talk, eat without my body in ridiculous pain. All there was left to do was sleep.",1,27
Abilify,"I was on Abilify for 3 weeks total. On the 3rd day on the drug I started to feel shaky, like something had to be moving at all times. I figured it would just go away so when I got no sleep that night from this I thought tomorrow will be better. But on day 4 it was worse so I called my doctor and he told me to take a half a pill and by this time my legs were visible shaking out of control. I would have to push on them to make them stop. On days 5, 6 and 7 I had the same thing: shakey and no sleep. Everything hurt from the shaking. It was so bad at one point I broke down in the middle of my in laws home. That day my doctor took me off this medicine and 2 days later all the shaking was gone.",1,37
Abilify,This medicine has made such a difference that my Sister even noticed.  I can talk with people and not get upset with them when they say or do stupid things.  I have noticed it has made me want to eat which I was having a problem with.  Never being hungry before taking this. $235 through insurance is still a lot of money every month. Thank you for this Drug Doctor.,10,34
Abilify,"I had an immediate reaction to the medicine; passing out, loss of time, nausea, etc. It took 3 days for the drug to be expelled from my system.",1,20
Abilify,"I've taken Abilify twice now.  The first time was with Seroquel and that was a disaster.  This time it's with Lamictal and a very small dose of lithium.  So far it seems to be keeping my manic behaviors and my depression at bay.  I'm pretty well balanced.  I've developed a minor upper respiratory infection which I've been told is a temporary side effect at the beginning of taking the medicine, so I'm hanging out with that.  I hope everyone has a good experience with this medicine.  I know how difficult it is to find the right medicine, I've been at this for 10yrs now.",0,28
Abilify,"I think this medication has really helped my state of mind and my ability to cope with new situations that I come across.  Some side effects, mainly the restlessness, is something I have an issue with, but its entirely manageable.  I feel like this medication has dramatically improved my quality of life.",8,26
Abilify,I developed akathisia after being on Abilify for 2 weeks. A rare side effect. I was really hoping the drug would work. Because of the side effect I can no longer take it.,3,19
Abilify,"I have bipolar disorder and my doctor prescribed Abilify to stabilize my moods.  It worked okay for a while, but after about three weeks on the drug I developed a Parkinsonian twitch in my right leg.",1,18
Abilify,"I am bipolar and have swung into a massive depressive cycle, crying for no reason, sleeping 14 or more hours a day, feeling hopeless about my life, suicidal thoughts, etc., so my doctor put me back on Abilify (I had been on it before but it had been such a long time I couldn't remember if it helped or not). In just a few days, at 5mg at night, my mood is very improved. I can actually get out of bed, I'm much more upbeat, much more pleasant to be around.  The only side-effect I have is when I take it, about half an hour later, I am soaked in sweat. My shirt actually becomes saturated to the point I have to change into a dry one.

Abilify,"My son was aggressive and was doing poorly in school. Hitting other students and the teachers, having meltdowns practically everyday. A week after he started taking Abilify his teacher called and told me he was like a different child. He was focusing and not getting upset so easily. I was just told he is the star student for the month and that has NEVER happened. He is now potentially looking at joining the general population at school. So far this has been a life saver and now my child can focus on learning and thriving instead of giving up and having fits when he gets frustrated.",10,85

Abilify,"Not very good, because I'm allergic to it.",0,13
Abilify,I took Abilify for a few months and then my doctor took me off of it because I gained 50 pounds. As soon as I stopped taking it- the weight just melted off.,1,51
Abilify,I have been on Abilify for a month now at 15mg. It works great I can control myself now. No more rages or trouble. My family is glad this pill works for me. I have been on 6 other medicines and they didn't work. Thank God for Abilify.,0,48
Abilify,"In a cocktail of anticonvulsants, this non-neuroleptic antipsychotic is great in stabilizing mixed manic symptoms and the depressive side. It took me one month to bear the side-effects but now it's ok. Better than all the antipsychotics I tried before that gave me unbearable tiredness or tremors/jerkiness.",8,44
Abilify,"I gained some weight and felt constipated, but it works very well when it's combined with Lamictal. It cured my insomnia and rage.",7,53
Abilify,"Extremely effective in countering onset of major events.  This is the only atypical antipsychotic  prescribed (twelve-year history), which I have found to be successful for my resistant condition.  Dosage is medium-high, producing occasional, but manageable side effects.  Used in five-drug regimen including antidepressants and mood stabilizers.",10,31
Abilify,"I have been taking Abilify for a week. It has already taken the edge off the rages.  However, am still experiencing high anxiety.  My family says I am calmer so that is deinitely a plus.  I feel tired and wired at the same time - it is a weird feeling.  I am very paranoid.  I was paranoid before but this seems to have made it worse. But I am only on 2 mg's. At least the rages are better.  I am hopeful that this medication along with help from my doctor will be enough to get my life back.",6,41
Abilify,I have been on this for 2 weeks (only 4 mg). I have energy again and do not feel so sleepy during the day. I am still taking seroquel at night- 100mg to sleep. Side effects are constipation and restlessness. I am now excercising again and able to drop the weight I had gained while on higher doses of seroquel.,8,58
Abilify,"I started this medicine not too long ago and love it. I have been on many other medicines over the years without good results. The one thing I would like to say to others who have written comments here is, do not say you would not recommend this to someone because it doesn't work for you. That is the reason there are different medications, and just because it doesn't work for you, it is ridiculous for you to say you wouldn't recommend others take it.",10,192
Abilify,"Abilify has been useful to me in terms of sleep and improving my insomnia, but I still have to be treated with a mood stabilizer, like Lithium, in order to keep my bipolar episodes under control. The good news is that it did not cause (I was at 10MG daily) weight gain like Zyprexa. Good luck to all of you!",6,68
Abilify,"This medication has given me my life back.  I have now have clarity and balance back in my life.  So far, I have not gained any weight and have experienced no side effects.  I also suffered from severe insomnia, which is completely gone.",10,115
Abilify,"This is a good antipsychotic and does well for bipolar disorder. I was on 20mg per day when I suffered a severe manic episode, so it is possible to have episodes while on the medication, but I should point out that I was not taking it every day as I was supposed to.  The only side effects I get from this are restlessness, anxiety and slight tremors.",8,71
Abilify,Restored my health significantly without side effects.,10,48
Abilify,I have been taking Abilify for about 3 years now. It has changed my life dramatically. It has greatly lessoned my highs and lows. It has balanced me out when it comes to all the typical bipolar symptoms.,10,103
Abilify,I've been on Abilify for about a month now. I take it at night and it has completely eliminated my insomnia. Overall I think it's a great medication.,8,44

Lithium,"I have been on Lithium for fifteen years and I can honestly say it didn't help all that much but I stayed on it because it's supposed to be the Gold Standard treatment for Bipolar Disorder. Now that I'm being weaned off from it I can see that it was actually making me worse. I was on 1200 mg. and I'm down to 600mg and feeling much better. Gone is my depression, my anxiety, my diarrhea, my lack of concentration etc. etc. etc. I wish I had known this years ago, I am going off from it now as my kidneys will fail if I stay on it much longer.   My previous Psych. Doc. would not use it as he saw way too many kidney failures at about the 15th-20th years while he was a resident.   Please know that this drug is not without dire consequences eventually in time your kidneys will fail, if you don't believe it see a kidney specialist don't let your doctor pooh pooh this statistic.  Please make an informed decision, and do what is right for you.",2,20
Lithium,"I can safely say that Lithium has changed my life for the absolute best and has been an absolute miracle pill for me. I'm a whole new person and finally I am always who I was supposed to be. I finally want to live and love life and myself again. I've been taking lithium for around 3 years and started off low with 300 mg, then 600 mg for a long time, and just now going to 900 as my blood tests show I am low on lithium. The only down side is having to get blood tests to check that everything is okay with your kidneys as that is where it is processed, but it's not a big deal at all at the cost of having my life back again. I'm no longer a crazy, mean, suicidal mess and now a nice, loving, stable, and content human being! Don't get me wrong, I'm not perfect and still deal with a lot but lithium just takes the edge off and makes me be able to tolerate my bipolar II. I also take Prozac at 60mg for depression and Klonopin 2mg for anxiety. So glad to have my life and myself back again!",9,31
Lithium,I have been on lithium for a year and it's made me depressed. I don't feel joy or love and am feeling disabled. I hope my psychiatrist does something to help me as I'm suicidal. Nothing works. I'm like a zombie.,1,24
Lithium,"I was prescribed 450mg of Lithium to take in conjunction with 200mg of Lamictal and 300mg of Wellbutrin due to still experiencing irritability, impulsivity, and paranoia from bi polar. The psychiatrist who prescribed this to me said that it was  the cure  for bipolar to combine Lithium and Lamictal so I was eager to try it. I was only on it for 5 days. I had to stop because my job requires me to drive a lot, and I was getting tired early on in the day, almost to the point of  being drowsy like I was on a high dose of Xanax or something. Also, after looking up all the long term side effects , I wasnt too thrilled about taking it anymore anyway. However I will say my mind was much clearer on this medication and it made me more articulate. I was still pretty irritable though. My new psychiatrist added 100mg of Lamictal in the morning along with the  200mg of Lamictal at night so well see if that helps.",6,20
Lithium,"Bipolar / adhd. I take Lithium, 300 mg morning, 900 mg night, Epival (Valproic Acid) to stabilise the Bipolar. It's amazing! If head ache, a dab of salt on the tongue, it's gone! No mood swings, no numbness, no memory loss, I got my life back. There's a 1 hr window to take bipolar pills, if forgotten, I'll get moody or excited, once taken, I'm back to calm and happy. For Adhd, I use Concerta. It's amazing! I'm learning to live with adhd  (my brains needs glasses (for children), My brains needs glasses again (for adults)). I learned about the VAGUS NERVE, a nerve directly linked from the stomach to the brain / vise-versa. Self-help books can heal you from head to toe. In conclusion. I adore Lithium, yes I gained some weight,   began a thyroid gland problem ,but will be off Synthroid, some doctors give it for prevention. No other issues with Lithium, nor Epival, nor Concerta. Perfect combination thanks to my psychiatrist!",9,18
Lithium,"I was diagnosed bipolar type I 9 years ago and had 3 acute mania during these 9 years. Most of the time I was very depressed with suicidal thoughts. Anger bursts, high irritability (light, noise especially). Tried aripiprazole, pregabalin, valproic acid, clopixol, quetiapine, even cbd, all more awful that each of them (except cbd which is a bit calming but not so efficient after a few days, very expensive and nothing compared to lithium). Lithium was a revelation and calmed my mind immediately without making me feel a zombie. I'm a more calm and relax person with far less anxiety while being even more focused. Lucky. I've even stopped cutting the skin under my feet. Miraculous drug for me at 600mg extended release of carbonate. Lithium is a powerful element, it might not suit you but you should discuss this option with your doctor if you feel no drug works for you.",10,28
Lithium,Been on lithium for about 2 years now for bipolar 1 disorder this medication helped in the beginning but now it does nothing for my unstable mood the side effects get worse each day it also causes severe acne and weight gain I wouldn't recommend lithium to anyone lots of bipolar meds out there try something else!,4,12
Lithium,"Im on lithium for my manic bipolar with psychosis and I dont have episodes anymore- this the only good part about being on Lithium but now I cannot stomach much food without getting sick, if I dont take it regularly I get awful headaches and not to mention it has taken my memories of childhood and I do try my best to grasp my memory of here and now but I honestly cannot tell you what I did even yesterday but the worst part is the muscle spaz and your body is in constant pain but Ive gotten use to it been on it for two years now",6,13
Lithium,"Diagnosed bipolar 2 in 2018 took Latuda 30mg and lamictal 150mg hated the teeth clenching and the skin crawling feeling. Quit medications January 2019. Manic episodes lasting 3 months until starting  meds  at the end of October 2019 lithium 300mg twice daily and latuda 30mg daily. Lithium side effects craving salt, slight hand tremors, numb feelings and acne little noticeable.  Lithium took effect almost immediately I love it. I was close to destroying my entire life until taking lithium. Don't give up! ??",8,25
Lithium,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder II at 18 and I am now 27. Since my teens Ive had debilitating, mostly  mixed  depression and with suicidal ideation, self harm behaviors (cutting), and a few hospitalizations from suicide attempts. I tried multiple antidepressants (Zoloft, Prozac, Cymbalta, Effexor), mood stabilizers (Lamictal, Latuda,  Depakote), atypical antipsychotics (Seroquel, Abilify), and finally, Lithium, which I discontinued after two weeks because I didnt feel a change.  Five years later, I decide to try Lithium again as a last resort. I forced myself to stay on it for at least 3 months because I read it takes several weeks to notice a difference. Nine months later and Im on Lithium 900mg and I have ZERO suicidal thoughts, no interest in self harm (completely foreign to me now), no crying spells, low mood, etc. I experienced its full efficacy at 4 months with minimal side effects. Lithium changed my life. For first time in my life I feel healthy emotionally.",10,43
Lithium,"After being diagnosed with bipolar 2 in 2003, I have taken Lamotrigine, Divalproex Sodium, Clonazepam, Risperidone, Olanzapine, Abilify, and more recently Seroquel. I wish you the same luck with finding the best treatment plan, and even though Lithium didn't work for me, it may work very well for you. I recently tried Lithium and by the end of the first week I felt nauseated and had developed diarrhea at 150mg. Increasing the dose to 300mg worsened these side effects and I felt like I had a bad case of the flu that caused me to go back to bed several days after awakening and depression set in. Increasing to 450mg caused the most severe depression. After speaking with my doctor, we discussed to decrease to 300mg and then try to  maintain that, but unfortunately the depressive thoughts didn't end, even after reducing to 150mg for the final week for a total of a six week trial. It wasn't until about three weeks after I stopped Lithium that I broke out of the depression and feel better.",1,8
Lithium,"I was only on lithium for a couple months. My doctor prescribed it because he thought it would help with the suicidal thoughts related to my bipolar depression. While I was on it, I felt very strange and almost out of my body. I gave it a good go, but eventually I decided that the strange feelings in my body and brain were too much to take. I know lithium works for many people and is considered on of the best bipolar medications, but for me it just made me feel super weird and not myself.",1,16
Lithium,"Was on lithium for about 8 months for my bipolar. To be fair to lithium I was on a cocktail of meds at the time so I cant say too much except that I was also on topamax, depakote, Effexor, ambien, all at once. I saw a picture of myself and I looked like I had had a stroke. My doc said I looked great. I think the depakote messed up my hormones because my stomach bloated like I was 7 months pregnant. The man at the store I bought cigs from said I sucked if I was smoking when pregnant and I said I am for sure I am not! Anyways the doc didnt think to test my blood levels so who knows what that whole 8 months was a haze.  I was new to a bipolar diagnosis so I didnt know that the doc was a quack. I cant even remember what dose I was on. Anyways that was when I took lithium so I cant say what I think truly experienced because of the cocktail. Otherwise it may have been a good fit. I wouldnt take again because I have hashomotos.",1,4
Lithium,"Lithium has definitely helped me.   At start  I had side effects but they went away after couple weeks .  I am currently on 900mg, I  have put on weight but that is better than being in  a bipolar depression.  I am also on seroqel and  lamotogen.  This combo works well but sleep still bad",10,5
Lithium,"This medication started working immediately and successfully. My bipolar disorder was out of control when I finally received my diagnosis. Lithium was the first medication I was prescribed for this mental illness. Ive added and subtracted additional medications over the years, but Ive never left Lithium. My psychiatrist and I both agree it works extremely well in my case. It does manage mania better than depression, so Im on another prescription for my  lows.  I did have side effects on the immediate release tablets, but once I switched to ER, the only thing I noticed was acne. It doesnt bother me much though, and it has died down significantly, but Id still take stability over clear skin any day.",9,19
Lithium,Ive been on lithium carbonate since I was 18 years old only coming off twice in my thirties for pregnancies. I can tell a major difference when I am off/on lithium. I am 100% sure that Lithium saved my life. 10/10,10,30
Lithium,Lithium  is the only medicine that helped me with my bipolar disorder,10,23
Lithium,"Doc in 1991 put me on lithium when I was first diagnosed with bipolar.  It didn't work.  He told me keep taking it, it'll work.  6 months later I was still manic...  I wound up getting another doctor, put me on Tegretol.  I was stable in a week.",1,11
Lithium,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder 2 at 18 years old. From then until I was 22, my life was bad. I couldn't remember ever being happy if I wasn't manic. I had an emptiness that consumed me and left me wanting to end it all. I had tried every medicine- with one doctor recommending shock therapy- until Lithium. Lithium gave me my old self back, to the point where I feel no trace of my disorder. The cons: My stomach gets queasy after I take it, so I take it at night. My thyroid has been negatively affected, so I now have to take Synthroid. The pros: I am happy again, I am functional again, and I no longer feel like a burden. Definitely try it, especially if you've tried everything like I have. Feel better :)",9,29
Lithium,"I've been on lithium for 6 months for Bipolar I and have had such amazing results. I feel like myself, and hadn't since over 2 years ago when I was diagnosed. I would give it a 10 if not for the side effects and necessary bloodwork. When I first got on, I noticed it felt like my legs were giving out when I was walking. First 2 months on it had significant hair loss but don't experience it anymore. I think it made me lose about 5 lbs. Gave me moderate  acne which is improving but I also went on spironolactone for the acne... if you can deal with the side effects, it's pretty great!",8,17
Lithium,"I was diagnosed at 23 with bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic features and placed on lithium almost immediately I felt improvement and my mania subside. It works great for mania and mixed episodes however in my case not so much for depression, lithium has saved my life. It takes away the issues of suicidal thoughts and suicidal ideation in between episodes for me and racing thoughts well. It's about as stable as stable is for me considering having bipolar disorder. I am now 26, I had to stop it due to it having damaged my thyroid. Even so I have decided after almost 6 months off it and having tried every medications available, but I would rather have whatever time stable with this medication and risk that than the destructive episodes. The side effects I initially experience are: light hand tremors, nausea, diarrhea. These go away. The long term side effects I have are: emotional blunting, lethargy, Increased thirst, more frequent urination and cravings for salt.",10,16
Lithium,"Lithium is nice, but it does have little price to pay.  Diagnosed Bipolar II 2 months ago, figured that I had bipolar literally since my first memories and started taking lithium (600mg at day and 600 mg at night), absolutely works like a charm, and now I picked up my social relations and is able to work full-ahead for my college applications.  However, it does make me thristy (I mean water is healthy so it's not bad) and numbs my emotions.  I don't feel any happiness or sadness, nor am I capable of love. My personality hasn't changed however, and I still appears to be the same in front of others, only calmer.  That inner peace is invaluable, although you may need to think twice if you have a significant other.",9,25
Lithium,"I said no to lithium a hundred times to my psychiatrists in the past because of the awful things I've heard about the side effects. Now that I am on it after having so many episodes, all I can say so far after trying it myself and reading all these good responses is that I wish that I tried it sooner. My head feels clearer, I respond faster. It doesn't feel heavy like other psychiatric drugs which makes me feel worried because I think will it actually stop me from being manic again. I am on 400mg going up to 600mg lithium and 350mg clopixol depot injection every week. Trying lithium is the last result as I have tried almost every thing else. I have been to prison due to my mania, my mania gets pretty bad so I had to give this ago despite the things I've heard, I don't want to go back there ever again so this is my last hope. Wish me good luck that this will work. I will keep you updated in a couple of months.",10,44

Anxiety is difficult as it is but on full blast it's a nightmare. I'm also sort of manic. Very go-go-go! I'm gonna give it some more time but so far I think I may need a lower dose.

I haven't had a manic episode since on the drug. HOWEVER the drug completely numbs me out, and I don't experience any happy or sad feelings.

Lithium,"I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in July. I was put on lithium 150mg and 50mg of seroquel. The lithium pulled me right out of a suicidal depression. I went off it last Thursday, due to mild psoriasis. Went to a new psychiatrist who put me on 45mg of lithium and 100 of seroquel last night. I feel better already!!  A bit shaky, but no other side effect. Praying that this psoriasis will be the only side effect. Good luck to all of you!!",10,15
Lithium,"Taking this medication at a dosage of 300-600 mg per day for the past 6+(lost count it's been so long) years has allowed my body to be able to heal itself. I also have no side effects at this dosage range. It is the only medication (I've tried all mood stabilizers, most antipsychotics, many SSRIs, and others) that has enabled me to achieve real remission. Other meds have helped, but they only masked the underlying problem. I have bipolar I and for the first time since my diagnosis 15 years ago, I have been episode free for more than a few months, actually it's been about 2 years now! Even at low therapeutic levels, lithium can help the brain protect and repair itself. This is backed up by scientific studies. It doesn't happen overnight, but with therapy and treatment compliance, lithium can help reverse some of the unseen damage caused by bipolar episodes. Lithium not only saved my life, it helped make mine a life worth living.",10,37

No more racing thoughts, no more impulsive spending, no more erratic behaviour, no more feelings of torturous agitation, and last but by no means least, I no longer have any desire to use illicit drugs or drink alcohol. Now for the bad news: It takes time for this drug to take it's full effect. In my case, I had to micro-dose my way up from 300mg to 1200mg by going up 150mg every 5 days because the side-effects would of been too unbearable if I didnt. All in all, it took close to 6 months until I was fully stable and side-effect free.",9,19
Lithium,"I'm Bipolar 1 and my psychiatrist put me on Lithium after my first hospitalization for a manic episode with psychosis. I was really afraid because I have heard horror stories, but I trusted him. It's been almost two years and I have had no symptoms. Seriously. I have a normal range of emotions. I get happy and tear up when I see a cute dog, cry when something really bad happens, but nothing a normal person wouldn't experience. I was afraid I would be a zombie but I'm not at all. Overall I'm very happy. I drink a lot of water anyway so that wasn't a big deal and I haven't noticed any changes in my hair.",10,38
Lithium,"These doctors knew I work outside but yet still gave me this medicine, Ive havent felt good in the summer while on this, so I did some research and the doctor and the pharmacist said it is a very dangerous medication to take while working in the sun, Im not a happy person right now",1,18
Lithium,"<b>Lithium Carbonate ER (lithium):</b>			 There was never a change in my moods while on lithium; in fact, they got worse, almost like I wasn't on other medications to help with my moods and depression. I tried to tell my doctor that nothing was happening and I wasn't feeling even a little bit better, but he kept me on it for another 2 months before I made him change to a different medicine if he wanted me to leave his office.

Lithium,"I was so nervous about taking Lithium for my bipolar. I had read far too much, the good, the bad the ugly. I was worried about what this medication would do to my body, my kidneys etc., and more superficial concerns about weight gain and hair loss. I have been taking lithium for approx 1.5 years now. Aside from a very slight tremble when I sometimes drink, the side effects have been minimal. I'd estimate I have put on approx 1 stone since starting the medication, but that is something that I am in a good mindset now to tackle, and think I can lose.  No problems so far with skin and sun sensitivity. The regular blood tests are important, and come around quickly, but so far results have been in the normal range. I feel like I have my life back. My marriage was in real danger, I couldn't enjoy parenting my children, now I feel I am back in control. When I think of all the trepidation I felt at the start of this journey, I wish I could tell earlier self to give it a go, things are going to be okay.",10,50
Lithium,"Lithium SAVED MY LIFE. I was crazy. Drugs, alcohol, mania, impulse. I started lithium and 3 months later I'm myself again, I love life and I love being me again. The only downside is frequent labs and consistent water intake. Otherwise, I'm loving it.",9,38

Lithium,So I had a hypermanic episode on just 5-10mg of lexapro was then diagnosed with atypical bipolar disorder and now I have to be on mood stabilizers. Basically I think lithium may have made me more irritable and it also gave me bad dandruff. iIswitched to latuda instead.,4,8
Lithium,"I've never been to a psychiatrist. However I've had a baby die, and I've been through the worst grief, and denial of grief. I've been deeply sad and broken. I've shut down emotions out of fear of being unemployable and not being able to care for my other children. This 30 years compressed into a deadly human, edgy and angry. So I started taking over the counter lithium, 5mg, and felt my brain swirl into a fluid relaxed state, like a lava lamp, or shimmering mirages over a landscape. Then I bought 50g of lithium chloride, a simple salt of lithium, like sodium chloride. I put 10-20 mgs of this in a carafe of water and drink it throughout the day. The water tastes very good. To close this, I want to make it clear to everyone that lithium is an essential element that everyone needs. If you don't get enough from your environment you will have lithium deficiency. The symptoms of lithium deficiency are bipolar, depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicide; rage, frustration etc",10,27
Lithium,"Lithium worked when all others failed. However, when I first started, I felt a numbness in my thinking. I am an artist and it took away my creativity for about a month but then life went back to normal. I would recommend this as a fist drug though doctors may disagree.",10,24

Lithium,"After trying Seroquel XR and Lamictal combined together with no effect on my bipolar depression, my doctor started to doubt my bipolar diagnosis. Then, he added lithium carbonate extended release two times a day. Within two weeks, I began to feel significant relief from my depression, suicidal thoughts, and mood swings. And with each day, my functioning and symptoms improves more and more. Lithium medicine saved my life and gave me hope for living a normal life when I never thought I would have one again.",10,31
Lithium,"Diagnosed as Bipolar II rapid cycling. Tried many drugs before: Seroquel, Tegretol, Depakote, valproic acid and they weren't so effective because of multiple hospitalizations. Been hospitalised 8 times per 1.5 years and had many med changes. During last stay in hospital, pdoc decided to give me Lithium. My blood tests always showed low lithium levels. So I didn't feel anything, was severely depressed, hopeless about everything. But after 3 weeks my blood tests showed good results and I started to notice a change in my mood. I became more socialised, my mood is much better, I joke more, have more energy, less anxiety and better sleep. For the first time in my life, I can say I feel at peace. Lithium made me slower, but I still feel it's benefits and all this time I didn't have a mood swing. Don't be afraid of this medication, if it helped me, it'll sure benefit you in some way. It's few days since I feel better, but every day I feel better and better.",9,50
Lithium,"Lithium is a wonder drug for bipolar, my child is sane because of it.",10,21
Lithium,"Diagnosed type 2 bipolar and PTSD a few years ago, I'd tried four alternative medications before I found Lithium. I've found it to have by far the least side effects, although like all other mood stabilisers and antipsychotics I've tried it does pull all moods into the middle of the spectrum and flatten things out. Lithium saved my life when I first began it, but I find it easy to feel hazy and restless nowadays. Still, highly recommend it! Feeling next to nothing is better than feeling suicidal.",8,20
Lithium,"I'm not really sure about this. Sure it's good not to be manic, but it lengthens my depressive cycles, i.e. there is no up(mania), there's a brief period of stability that goes away almost immediately, and LONG depressive cycles to the point where I would rather be untreated.  Mania may not be ideal but it's better than the long depressive phase A bleak life is what Lithium offers me personally.",4,23
Lithium,"My diagnosis is Bipolar I with PTSD. I have a tendency toward mixed episodes and psychotic features. I found relief with lithium when nothing else worked. Other drugs like Lamictal gave me horrible cognitive side effects. I couldn't finish sentences or remember things that happened minutes ago. That was not the case with Lithium. I took Lithium for the first time during inpatient for a severe mixed episode and the difference was like night and day. It was like taking a painkiller when in severe pain. Within thirty minutes I felt what I can only describe as RELIEF. I've never had such a rapid and drastic reduction in symptoms. There is a reason Lithium is considered the gold standard in treating bipolar disorder. Everyone is different and some experience bad side effects with little relief on this medication, however I would recommend at least trying it if your doctor prescribes it. The only side effect I experience is increased thirst- a small price to pay for getting my life back.",10,44
Lithium,"I have bipolar 2 disorder and my psychiatrist prescribed me lithium. Have already been on antipsychotics but we were intending on switching medication. I also have PTSD. Day 5 on lithium and it has noticeably made my PTSD and associated mental pain far worse and far more distracting and disabling. The effects of this is reduced motivation, increased tiredness, loss of smooth social skills, impaired cognitive functions. Its not as severe as you may think, I can still function, but it has made living less pleasant and made it harder to get things done. I also experienced hand tremors for a few minutes which were unpleasant. Overall I would say it has an emotional numbing effect which detaches you from feeling things strongly so it is more difficult to function and interact with life. If you experience mania and say experience happiness far too strongly it could be helpful, but other medications (antipsychotics) are better (in my experience).",2,18
Lithium,"I have only been on this medicine a short while, but all I can say is that I feel extremely balanced, and level. I feel like my depressive episodes have eased up quite a bit, which is amazing. Now, my moods hardly ever go into the depressive zone of the Bipolar mood scale.  I can actually function again in life, and at my job! Plus, my anxiety levels are pretty much nothing now. For me, Lithium works as a mood stabilizer/anti anxiety/and somewhat of an antidepressant all in one. Lithium is a miracle, and I hope it works for you, as well as it did with me. Big hugs to all you other Bipolars out there:)",10,75
Lithium,"I have a bit of love/hate with lithium with the love outweighing the hate side of it. Im Bipolar 1, diagnosed 4 years ago. Mentally, it is great. Keeps me level as long as I take it as prescribed, 600mg 2X a day. Prior to diagnosis,  I had a self-diagnosed problem with alcohol (self-medicating likely) and since Lithium I hardly ever drink, maybe 2-3 times a year and only 1-2 at a time. I no longer get the same feelings from alcohol, which is odd and true. I consider that a plus. On the negative side, I had beautiful hair and now its dry and dull, so Im always trying new products. Also, I have dirarhea 2-3 times a day most days. As it works so well mentally, I put up with these side effects. I like staying employed and being mostly responsible.",9,37
Lithium,Gave me a nasty seizure my 5th day on it. I am currently on Depekote and its really working for me.,1,14
Lithium,"<b>Lithium Carbonate ER (lithium):</b>			 I started on 150mg then switched to ER, I'm at 600mg heading for 900mg now and I have to say, you HAVE to give this drug time.  I was anal retentive and a perfectionist with a lot of anxiety and depression. It was also easy to manipulate me because I had such low self-esteem at the time. I'd constantly find myself befriending those who had just as low self-esteem and those who liked to undermine me. Since I started, I started to grow a backbone and it scared a lot of the people who had this control on me. I've thankfully removed these toxic people from my life and have gradually brought in people who want the best for me. It really is a good mood stabilizer. What I do feel bad about today is that the friendships I lost because I wasn't on this drug previously to prevent me from doing something stupid.",0,43
Lithium,I love it.. thanks Dr from St. Louis you saved me thanks,0,11
Lithium,"<b>Lithium Carbonate ER (lithium):</b>			 I was originally diagnosed with PMDD, but my doctor suggested I might actually have Bipolar Disorder Type 2 since I get seasonal depression.  Sometimes I actually enjoyed my hypomania, but I had crippling anxiety and suicidal ideation that were difficult to live with.  I started with 600mg and hated the side effects of lithium at first.  The first two months were rough- I couldn't sleep because I had to urinate so often.  I wanted to stop but didn't. My doc changed my dosage to 450mg ER and I love it.  I am not the high-strung perfectionist I used to be.  I feel peaceful and stable.  It's actually kind of weird, but I would never want to go back.  GIVE IT TIME, ADJUST DOSAGE! :)",0,46
Lithium,"I was first prescribed Lithium years ago and stopped taking it within the first few months because of stomach pains nausea, and thirst. I chose to go unmedicated for years (not the best choice for me or my family). Years later I decided to give Lithium another try after finding that I couldnt take Lamictal due to side effects and the other drug options seemed to have too many side effects.  Im so glad I went back on Lithium. I gave it some time and, after a few weeks, the stomach pains and nausea disappeared, as did the thirst. It works very well to even out my moods and prevent future episodes. Additionally, I get blood tests every 3 months to ensure my body is not being harmed by the drug. Also, if youre concerned about cost, this drug is very reasonably priced since it cannot be patented.",10,29
Lithium,Pros: -stable enough to hold down a part time job now -reduced the urge to attack my friends and family for no    good reason -lower sex drive Cons: -gained 10 pounds -constantly feel like I need to pee -still too depressed to go back to college -lower sex drive Final verdict: It's okay.,7,26
Lithium,"I was placed on lithium Sep/17 during a powerful manic episode.  I had zero insight into my bizarre behavior.  Unfortunately the Lithium was not enough to bring me down alone.  With valproate and olanzapine I was mostly over the mania by early November.  I did have nausea, extreme thirst, coarse tremors, and an overall ill feeling for the first few months so I completely understand the temptation to quit.  On the bright side, since the cycle ended I think the lithium has made me much calmer and more stable.  I have not had a single day where I exhibited hypomanic behavior, which is a huge improvement over the prior decade.  Other than thirst and fine hand tremor the side effects are gone.  I never would have thought nine months ago that 2018 would turn out to be one of the best, most stable years of my life.",8,26
Lithium,"I had bad bouts of eratic spending, high sex drive and sudden lows. Luckily my wife stuck by me and got me help. I have been diagnosed bipolar for 5 years but had terrible weight gain and I'm going to seek help to reduce dosage. Thank you.",9,26
Lithium,Good,0,7
Lithium,"Lithium has been very helpful and it has really helped the depression side of bipolar II. No more suicidal thoughts (which no other medicine has this benefit!) and quality of life has gone up. It has stabilized my mood, and the hypo-mania with severe depression (psychotic features)    I have been on lithium for about 5 months and the benefits started to show after 3 months of being on it.  if you are starting this, be patient, results are not immediate.",8,39
Lithium,"<b>Lithium Carbonate ER (lithium):</b>			 I had high hopes for this drug as I had heard so many great things about it especially for people who are seriously in the throes of major depression and/or have and are experiencing a lot in their lives on a regular.  However, sadly it really didn't do much for me.  I just felt flat, not happy, not sad but still sad if that makes any sense, and somewhat neutral.  Now I thought that I would prefer to be neutral but it's like I didn't care, didn't feel, everything was whatever.  On top of that it made me go to the bathroom a lot.  I already drink about 6-8 bottles per day and had had to go up to 8-10.  My system just couldn't handle this drug and like I said, no real relief.   I also want to add that this was my second time trying this drug and likely my last.  Additionally, the 1st time I was prescribed 600mg, the second time 1200mg.  Didn't matter either way, it just makes me not care and that's already part of my problem.",0,36
Lithium,"Been on lithium for 5 years and its kept me well for the most part, episodes have on been hypo manic and partially brought on by choices I made. The drug is great at keeping moods stable. Side effects for men are : easy to vomit, excessive urination and I get thirsty. I can deal with those knowing I dont have to experience the extreme highs and lows of bi polar whole on lithium. I currently take 1500mg and dont use any other drugs and it works great !",9,25
Lithium,"After numerous hospitalizations and medications I was prescribed lithium. I remember it so clearly while I was in the hospital. After taking it my brain literally felt like it was in a car accident. I asked my Dr  Does this mean it working my brain was literally sore. He laughed nicely and said yes... I could actually hear and process what people were saying without interrupting them. My mind was calm and my brain was processing everything. I do not know why the medical community does not prescribe lithium more. I started out on 900 milligrams and now I only need 300 milligrams a day along with 150 of wellbutrin for weight stabilization and depression. It not only work for Bipolar I also have borderline personality disorder issues. Self harm, drugs alcohol etc. Scientists even say we all need low doses of lithium research it for yourself and God bless to all who need to be cured.",9,57
Lithium,"I just started 900 mgs per day a week ago and I hate it!  I noticed so far a slight difference in mood for the better.  The side effects are horrible......especially having headaches all the time.  Other problems are stomach ache and  ready to barf any second, extreme thirst, morning dry mouth, big raised welts on upper chest and face, painful rash now starting, night sweats--wake up completely soaked so not sleeping thru night. Ugh it goes on...sharp shooting pain on right side about where the liver is, heart beats really hard, having a hard time breathing-my lungs hurt.  This all scares me so much.  It's not worth it to take a medication that does all this to me on an everyday basis.   I wish there was another stabilizer, something else to take without all this....",5,19
Lithium,"I'm a teenager with type 2 bipolar disorder and I've been on lithium and luvox for over 4 years and its worked wonders for me. I'd recommend this to anyone. Over the course of 3 years prior to this medication  I was hospitalized 4 times due to suicide attempts and after being on lithium I haven't been hospitalized since. The only downside that I have had is extreme thirst, and 0 sex drive.",9,25
Lithium,Honestly this is the most effective drug by far! I am so calm and my thinking is so much more organized. All the cry babies whining about the blood tests are ridiculous. This medicine is awesome. Don't give up on the drug you have to give it time. The only downfall is getting to a serum level that works for you. I'm on 1200mg 0.7 and that seems to be working just fine. Keep your head up  and give it at least  3 months.,8,39
Lithium,"<b>Lithobid (lithium):</b>			 I was taking regular lithium before lithobid. We switched to lithobid thinking the extended release would be easier on my body. I had nothing but problems after switching to lithobid; for some reason my body rejected this drug when lithium was always good to me. Six months later I moved and switched pharmacies and due to a pharmacy error I got 300mg of lithobid instead of my prescribed 1500mg. They couldn't give me more but for some reason were able to give me 1200mg of lithium. After just two weeks of being on 1200 lithium and 300 lithobid, people started telling me I seemed like myself again. And I was feeling much better. My anxiety was way down and I wasn't having strange spikes into delirium. So I don't know why, but lithobid was a completely useless drug for me, while lithium did its job. They should be the same thing, right? But if you're having problems on lithobid, I guess know that it's possible for you to react to it differently than plain ol' lithium.",0,17
Lithium,"Worked fine at first, but my Dr. constantly messed w/ the dose (15-20 changes in 2 years) to keep my lithium levels consistent. I ended up w/ almost every side effect (hair loss &amp; tremors were most severe) and it just stopped working altogether. My episodes were worse than ever and I ended up being hospitalized from being put on too high of a dose (vomiting blood &amp; lithium level was at 2.4 instead of 1.0) Eventually I just stopped taking it on my own and switched doctors. It might have worked well if I had a more responsible doctor to monitor everything, but Im too shell-shocked to give it another go :/",2,17
Lithium,"I started taking lithium when I was about 24 yrs old.  It did help my mania and depression.  I decided about a year later that I didn't need it anymore so I stopped taking it.  I went manic almost immediately and ended up in the hospital for 3 months.  I have now been on lithium for over 40 years and no mania or depression has come back although I really enjoyed the mania part.  Getting the levels right is really important and it takes time.  I've read some other comment on here where people are saying they've tried it for a few months and quit....lithium takes about a year to feel like normal, at least it did for me.",0,36
Lithium,"<b>Lithobid (lithium):</b>			 I started having severe depression in 1971b(suicidal ideations) followed by manic episodes that ended in psychosis, jail and mental institutions.

I quit taking lithium once in 1983 to go natural and wound up in the puzzle house.  I have been taking it ever since (1200 mg/ day) and have experienced no perceptible side effects.  I just had blood work done and have normal kidney and liver function.  I did quit drinking and I now exercise regularly.  I am now retired after a successful marriage and career. I have lived a good life.",0,61
Lithium,"I've been on lithium again now for few years.  I  was able to wean off of it a long time ago under doctors supervision. I do experience slight tremors in my fingers but I honestly can say hand on heart its brilliant at keeping the manic episodes at bay. Now for the depression episodes my psychiatrist added Sertraline 150mg and 100mg Lamictal which the three make a super combo one for mania, two  for depression. I have been episode free now for several years. I cannot say anything bad about Lithium it has been a life saver for me. And of course thanks be to God for His help.",10,27
Lithium,"I wrote a review in the lamotrigen review area also. I was on lithium for 30 years. It is so important to get blood tests for kidney, thyroid function every 6 months. My kidneys did well for those years until 2014 when creatinine level increased by .1. This is a big deal. That increase threw me into 3 CKD. Dr took me off lithium to lamotrigen and I am so pleased. Lithium caused extreme thirst and Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus which is a rare kidney disease. About Bi-Polar disease, the lithium worked wonders and I had no episodes in all those years. Bi Polar episodes are horrible and I thank lithium for protecting me against those.  I have to deal with kidney disease now, you have to weigh the pros and cons.",8,18
Lithium,"Darius,  Wellbutrin is stimulant based, so it has potential to put someone with BiPolar into mania (which includes paranoia). I was on it at one point and it caused extreme paranoia and hallucinations. I'm not a medical professional but I would try another antidepressant. Please never stop taking a drug without talking to your doctor first. It's dangerous.  To all: I've been on lithium for about a month at 900 mg. I'm not myself. I'm so spacey and am just numb. If this is an antidepressant, I don't feel happy at all. I'm nauseous all the time which is affecting my ability to perform well in school. (hard to concentrate on school work when you feel like you're going to barf at any second all the time). I have hallucinations where objects, walls, etc. stretch taller and wider than they are and move around. I emailed my doctor tonight. I hate this drug. The only positive is that most days (when nausea hasn't kept me up all night) I can wake up early in the morning.",0,9
Lithium,I was put on lithium 450 mg with Wellbutrin XL 300 mg after trying almost all meds for bipolar 2 disorder. I kinda felt controlled by it and one day was talking to myself for 8 hours because I was at work and had nothing to do. Every since that day I've felt very uncomfortable as everywhere I go and felt like and knew everybody was watching and looking at me. The more I think about it the worst it gets. I cant even stop at a red light without being very uncomfortable feeling like every one is looking at me and I cant be still or make eye contact much and when I do its the wrong time and awkward. So I stop taking the lithium and Ive felt worst and worst as the days go by. I cant stop thinking about it and that makes it worst everyday. Can someone please help me and tell me what I need to do,5,7
Lithium,"I have been taking lithium for 7 years now and it has honestly saved my life. I have bipolar disorder and lithium has kept me on track, prior to taking the medicine I was having an extremely difficult time battling depression and mania.

Also have more energy. My dose is low due to my resistance of not wanting to put prescription drugs into my body. I am very glad I made the decision to take lithium. I felt the benefit on the first day. On the second day I started to feel agitated again at 4.30pm. Today was another great day.

Lithium,I have now been on lithium for 6 months. I am diagnosed with bipolar I. I had a mania in Nov so I increase my dose from 600 mg to 900 mg. and I doubled my seroquel dose. It took me a few weeks to recover but I am feeling better than ever. I will continue to monitor my sleep and make sure to increase my dose if I am not sleeping as thy is a sign for me that I'm manic. But so far I haven't felt as good as this since before I was diagnosed bp 13 years ago. Lithium has truly given me my life back. I have gained a bit of weight but I am unsure as to if this is from lithium or just holiday binge eating and not exercising enough.

I don't have as much up and down moods and I notice my racing thoughts have gone away for the most part. Things that used to bother me barely bother me anymore and I kind of just go with the flow of things now. The only down side of this medication is it makes me feel a little irritated at times and doesn't help with my anxiety as I was hoping.

The long term side effect profile is just awful.",2,17
Lithium,"I commenced lithium in 2012 as I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder. Initially starting it wasn't great fun- I experienced a lot of side effects (nausea, tremors, twitching, involuntary lip/tongue biting, vomiting, diarrhoea and thirsty as hell). But today I still take the lithium and I am happy. I work full time and live a fulfilling life. I do experience nausea from time to time which is why I stick to drinking the lithium at night time as it makes me sick to move around too much after drinking it. All in all, happy with it. Sadly I have missed doses at times (no more than 2 days in a row) which brings back some of the side effects when taking it again.",9,18
Lithium,"This has been very affective at treating my classic bipolar. The only side effects that I have had are GI and thirst. I haven't gained on it and have been taking lithium for ten months.

Lithium,"I have only been on this medication for 4 days. But I can tell you in these four days I have noticed an incredible difference in my brain function. I am diagnosed with Bipolar 1. I have had around 13 manic episodes with delusions since I was 17. I'm 29 now. I've been treating my condition naturally up until now as I wanted to avoid the side effects of Lithium. But these past few months I have been very sick rapid cycling and not able to sleep. I decided it was either take the lithium or die. Since I've been on it for four days I feel completely calm, focused, balanced. I really do feel like a light has gone on in brain. Like.. This is what it feels like to have a normal brain?  I have noticed a coated tongue. And a bit more tired than usual",0,33
Lithium,"Lithium brought me out of my original psychosis. I did well on it.  Because it helped to keep my illness in remission, so to speak, I was able to get my BA in psychology and go to graduate school. Seven years after I first took lithium I developed hypothyroidism, which was caused by the Lithium. Luckily it can be easily controlled with synthroid.  Twenty-three years later I was diagnosed as having kidney disease, stage 2. This was a direct side effect of Lithium. I no longer take it. The damage to my thyroid and kidneys is irreversible.  Luckily I haven't had to go on dialysis. Lithium is a good medication. However, it's side effects can do a lot of harm to the body.",0,52
Lithium,"I was dx bipolar I disorder and while I was very reluctant to start lithium &amp; had tried lamictal &amp; trileptal which both gave me bad reactions, I had no choice but to give lithium a try after several back to back hospitalizations. The psych insisted it was safe and I would just need blood tests every 3 months. For the first couple days my blood levels were monitored. Anyway, it wasn't until after a few weeks that I started to feel its benefits. At first I felt no side effects but now I do get a little drowsiness. But that's it. As for mood, it's mostly controlled my mania. I haven't felt so normal in a long time. It's weird to hear your thoughts speaking at a normal pace &amp; tone. @ 900mg a day I also take 15mg Abilify for delusions",0,26

The past few months I've gotten so bad to where I've thought about suicide constantly. I was so depressed, easily irritated and cried over the littlest thing. Lithium has so far, saved me. I feel the best I've felt in a LONG time! I have no side effect as of yet. My mind is completely cleared of any negative thoughts.

Since been on lithium:  I have stopped drinking alcohol (uses to drink a bottle of wine a day ) Stopped smoking cigarettes Stopped taking 2 anti depressants , sertraline and mirtazapine  I have lost 6 kg and walk 10km a day.

Lithium,"It was on a low dose of lithium so it didn't affect my mood that much. It definitely combats suicidal ideation though which was the reason I was put on it. However, the side effects are HORRIBLE. Dry mouth, weight gain, thirst, hand tremors, drowsiness, increased urination, no interest in sex, feeling cold all the time. This morning I passed out due to dehydration. It's not worth it. There are other primary mood stabilizers that you can go on.",5,16

At the time of starting these medications, I was easily agitated, would get angry at everyone over simple things.  I found I was grinding my teeth a lot, trying to cope with my feelings.  I was also becoming reclusive, since everything bothered me, I tried to avoid people and things that bothered me, so I would hide in my bedroom, and then the depression set in.  So far, these two medications have helped wonderfully, and have changed my life!",8,50
Lithium,I was prescribed 1200mg of lithium and unfortunately it didn't stablize my mood episodes.  It wasn't until I was prescribed an antipsychotic in addition to the lithium did I finally stablize.  People respond to it differently so it may be effective for some.,3,15

I haven't been this happy in years. I'm a completely different person. Sure, I have to deal with stomach aches if I don't eat with it. The thirst goes down but still need to drink water - that's very important. And tests are not that big of deal.",10,55
Lithium,"I had previously been put on every kind of antidepressant for depresion/anxiety. They all worked horribly; so I stopped all drugs and ceased seeing doctors.  Then, I felt insanely suicidal- I was absolutely crazed. Luckily my sister urged me to seek help as fast as I could- so I did. I went to see another psychiatrist, and he diagnosed me as bipolar. I started on Lamictal, but that didn't do anything for me. Then I switched to Lithium- THANK GOODNESS I still get depressed, but I never get sucked into a deep suicidal hole like before. I quit the drug for 1 month, which caused me to think about suicide unrelentlessly. Never again will I stop taking Lithium. (Does cause extreme thirst and hand tremors, but well worth it)",8,33
Lithium,"Taken for a year. All its done for me is make me lose my personality, sex drive, and some weight gain. Also too many blood tests...your blood could be toxic at any point.

Lithium,"I had poor medication management which lead me to having a toxic level for over two months,on and off...it wasn't until my heart had arrhythmia so bad that I suffered cardiac arrest and a small stroke....I was found in my apartment on the floor after 3 days...almost dead- rhabdomylosis was setting in, I was severely dehydrated, and could not move my body for over a week when brought to ICU..I then had an ICD placed in my chest  to control the arrhythmias ....no hemodialysis was given even though my Lithium level upon admission was,9 x the normal dosage. I was released to the psych ward where they gave me a other psychotropic to control my bipolar.  Now 3 years later I have almost no thyroid function, left sided weak",0,38
Lithium,"I have been taking Lithium, 1000g a day, for the past 39 + 1/2 years.  I always drink a lot of water daily, + wee a lot or course.  I have experiences tremours when water intake is low. I initially had hand tremor and some thinning hair.  I have been taking 2000g of fish oil for the past 15 years and have recently started epilim to fine tune my short manic episodes.  Lithium has been the saviour of my life many years ago after 2 manic episodes in one year.  I take blood tests yearly or every 2 years ( if I forget, )to determine effect/normality of the internal organs in relation to Lithium.  Resisting gambling, drugs ( smoking, ) and limiting alcohol has given me a lovely wife and seeing my now 2 adult sons grow up.",9,51
Lithium,"Long time user of Lithium, 35 years, I have Stage three renal failure, also have a atrophy cerebellum, and the last side effect is Downbeat  Nystagmus due to atrophy cerebellum.",3,32
Lithium,"Recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and have been treated with lithium for a little over 30 days. Received results from blood work and increased dosage. Only side effect I notice are vivid nightmares. They're just dreams, so I'm not really concerned. I still struggle with anger from time to time, or short fits of rage, followed by regret and self loathing, a common cycle for me. Trying to remain optimistic. Finding myself wanting to isolate more and more. I know this is not healthy. Looking for some positive feedback and/or suggestions. Thanks",3,22
Lithium,"I'm bipolar and was recently put on lithium. I can tell a huge difference and so can my family but it's been about 4 months now and I'm at a crossroads with staying on it. Some of the side effects I'm having are weight gain, thirsty all the time, constantly having to pee, hand tremors, my hair is falling out and blank emotion. I've read a lot about this drug and I know my liver,kidneys and thyroid are all at major risk for damage so what do I choose? Feeling better and dealing with all the crap that goes with this medicine or get off of it?  Decisions decisions???",0,35
Lithium,Lithium only worked for a short time then killed my thyroid. So now I have to have regular blood work and have to take thyroid medicine for the rest of my life. It would make me feel toxic. Harsh drug.,1,32
Lithium,"I've been on lithium for two months now, and honestly, it's given me my life back. I was treatment resistant for years, until Abilify came out. Unfortunately, that stopped working a few months ago, and in a fit of desperation, my doctor decided to add lithium. I was highly resistant, for many reasons, but I'm so glad I decided to try it. It took a few weeks to start feeling better, plus an increased dosage to 900 mg, but I honestly feel alive now. I'm better than I've been in years. In fact, we've started titrating me off the Abilify, which has had disastrous consequences in the past. I'm quite optimistic about my future now. The only side effect I've had is the tremors. Fingers crossed the nastier side effects stay away, amiright?",10,43
Lithium,For the first time in my life the noise  my very loud voice in my head that has NO filter is gone! The lithium has given me peace.. 8 months in and I am starting to miss my grandiose ideas but not enough to stop medication.  I will now be on this forever the peace and quiet in my mind allows me to regulate better and not get so angry,9,55
Lithium,"I started to take this medication when my Primary care physician got uncomfortable with my extensive use of Benzos for my extreme social anxiety so I was sent to a specialist who started me on lithium. The results are mixed for me.  On one hand, every time I would take a dose I would get sick to my stomach, I have no desire to eat and my hand trembling is noticeable.  However, I can now leave my house, go into stores, not depressed and much less dependant on the Benzos, but I still get panic attacks. Overall the pros have outweighed the cons.",7,33
Lithium,Not sure why they give this to people but they sure do...  Took 3 months and besides the foaming at the mouth and memory loss and the inability to articulate words ( my family thought i was drunk :( )  And the lack of coordination to the point i couldnt even walk straight.  I rode my bicycle on this stuff and tipped over into the street and almost got run over!!!!  So then they added Carbamazapine to try and help with the lithium side effects and it made EVERYTHING worse!!!  Folks there is only one drug i have found that helps both extreme mania and extreme despression and curbs the rapid swings and that is cannibus sativa ( not indica ).  God gave us this flower for a reason and no you dont even have to smoke it...  Just eat a cookie :),1,70
Lithium,"Didn't do anything except make me very tired. , aching joints, slightly incontinent so abandoned it .",1,24
Lithium,"I've had a severe manic episode and was put on antipsychotics which helped calming me down but I was still a bit manic. When put on lithium I felt a lot better because mania ceased. The difference between antipsychotics and litihium for me was like if antipsychotics stepped on the brake and lithium lifted the gas pedal.  The only, but still significant, side effect I've had is less short term memory. Lithium stabilize my mood, less anxiety and stress (less diarrhea, less neck pain, more relaxed), better sleep not just because mania stopped but also because overall well being I'm very satisfied with lithium as a mood stabilizer",8,56
Lithium,"I have  Bipolar Disorder, PTSD, Anxiety, OCD.  I Started taking 300 mg once at night, gradually went up to 1200 mg before my psychiatrist took me off of it. I've taken other mood stabilizers as well as antidepressants and antipsychotics with none really having a noticeable effect. It helped to mellow me out some, but during and after stressful life changes and traumatic events that occurred, my anxiety, mania, paranoia, anger, irritability, brain fog, etc. was full blown. My depression and brain fog always lingered throughout the whole time I took it as well. I did not want to risk upping my dosage due to the possible toxicity. I was starting to feel extremely nauseous after taking it even though I always took it with plenty of food and drank plenty of water.",5,34
Lithium,"I'm 21 and have bipolar disorder I've been on lithium for exactly a year next month. The only side effect I 100% know is from the lithium is retaining water weight (I haven't gained actual weight at all on lithium) once I drink more water I'm fine. I'm more on the manic pole so the lithium levels me out, decreases my impulses and over all I'm more pleasant to be around, less snappy. I was on Klonopin for 4 years and once I went on lithium I easily came off of it once my bipolar was under control (about 3 months into getting my lithium levels up) Lithium is a lifesaver to me and I can't imagine not taking it. It's the only one that works for me. And I like myself on lithium.Im more than satisfied after 8 years of trial and error.",9,63
Lithium,"Lithium is for Mania.  It is NOT a mood stabilizer.  Lamictal is an awesome mood stabilizer.  Anyway, Lithium has done wonders for me!  I feel calmer on it and not so spacey and think clearer.  The only thing that I do not like is the fear of it damaging my liver and/or kidney's.  I do blood work every 3 months to get my levels and make sure everything is ok. and he did lower me once because the lithium level had gotten too high.  Also, my hair is thinner and dryer since I started it.  Not fond of that either.",8,40
Lithium,"I took lithium twice by with no other drugs. First for a few days. I stopped because it made me feel flat &amp; it more difficult to think of the right word to use. My vocabulary &amp; ability to articulate were noticeably worse. I took it again at my doctor's advice- 300 mg for one week, then switched to 600 mg. The day I took the 600 mg I was so angry that I wouldn't leave the house because I thought I'd pick a physical fight (something I've never done). I stopped taking it altogether, and now my memory is much worse than it's ever been (memory has always been a severe problem for me to begin with). I generally have a harder time getting anything done, speak a lot more awkwardly now, and have been pretty upset that Lithium made my life worse.",1,33
Lithium,"I appreciate Lithium. Although my thyroid level is low, a supplement helps to equalize this problem. I've been through at least 20 different medications to stabilize my Bipolar diagnosis. I always wanted to be of normal state of mind. Lithium has allowed me to be equally yoked with myself. 300mg ER in the evening. 100mg of Seroquel in the evening. 20mg of  Cymbalta in the morning! I'm set! If I'm feeling anxiety I can add Busper or Loranzapam.",10,29
Lithium,"I take lithium 300 mg twice daily. The lithium makes me pee constantly and I really have to watch it if I decide to have any alcohol - I drink just 2 small beers and I'm very buzzed. The lithium makes me feel stable and it keeps me from having severe or deep depression. It has eliminated my severe depressions and it's the only drug I've tried that does this. I still get the blues or feel slightly depressed but NOTHING like the suicidal black hole depression I used to experience.  Also, it slows me down during hypomania so I don't escalate to full blown mania. But if I neglected to take my lithium during hypomania (ran out) when in full blown mania -lithium helps, but in my case I must take an anti psychotic to ground me as well.",8,40
Lithium,"I was on lithium carbonate, for 21 years. Mentally I found lithium to be a very effective mood stabiliser. The physical effects of lithium, is what affected me in the long term. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, after being on lithium for 7 years, which my doctor attributed to being on lithium long term, and after being on lithium for 21 years, I was diagnosed with Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which an endocrinologist, attributed to being on lithium long term, the symptoms of this are increase thirst and increase urination, as I passed 10 litres of urine in a 24 urine test. Recently I have just had one of my kidneys removed due to renal cancer, which I attribute to the long term use of lithium also.",3,63
Lithium,"I am labeled bipolar II. I take 1200 mg of lithium a day. It has helped in my case.  No more fast cycling manias, no real bouts of depression. The downside is that hurt the libido as I have seen some studies where it can decrease testerone and my level is low. It all started when I started the lithium. I experience flat emotion, what made me realize it was it was hard to grieve when my mom passe. Typically, nothing never really effects me, I rarely feel stress or pressured,  I am indifferent to most things. I am on Wellbutrin, lamictal and occasional Xanax but the lithium is the culprit I believe. So now it's a trade off, get off it and play merry go round the meds Or keep on it and deal with the side effects, I go back and forth on it.",8,29
Lithium,"Been on lithium about 26 years. Currently on 1,200mg putting my lithium level at 1.0. It dramatically improved my sleep which without lithium is a major problem. It has made me more pleasant to be around, close to stopped my angry, irritable ways and keeps me from destroying relationships. No weight gain, mild tremor and dry mouth. This medication I combination with lower dose Prozac has saved my life and given me a quality life. Outstanding medication and very inexpensive!",10,59
Lithium,"I have bipolar I disorder, usually mixed episodes.  I've been on lithium for about 14 years.  Lithium controls the cycling, keeps me free from mania, and causes absolutely no side-effects whatsoever.  My lab tests have always been fine.  I take 1200 mg a day.  I also take quetiapine 300 mg and risperidone 2 mg a day.",9,31
Lithium,"I have bI polar was diagnosed last year and since I was a baby I had epilepsy. Anyway, I've been on Lithium for a long time and  hate it. It killed my thyroid. When I started taking it, first blood test I took a month later. When results came out my doctor said I have hypothyroidism now. I had a lot of pain that I could not even move, and I was cold from my hypothyroidism. It was all from this pill. I want to be off of it. I fund anticonvulsant pills that also does bipolar, I showed it to him. And he says that my neurologist has to agree. I see her end of this month. Do not take Lithium.... it kills your thyroid!",1,17
Lithium,"I'm currently between diagnoses of Bipolar II and BPD. I started on 400mg Lithium (taking my level to 0.3) and already felt some effects with it. I recently increased this to 600mg and whilst I feel like myself again, I have a few side effects. A lot of nausea, being put off of food, an extreme thirst (which isn't a bad thing because it's important to stay super hydrated on Lithium!), minor muscle weakness and stomach issues. When starting and increasing the dose, I became incredibly gassy (thankfully, odourless!) and have had slight stomach upsets. I've also found acid reflux to be a huge symptom for me also, whether it is caused by taking Lithium alongside Celexa (Citalopram) and Inderal (Propranolol), I'm unsure. overall, great drug.",9,18
Lithium,"Poison for your body. It was sold to me like all docs who can push pills sell them, essentially docs are drug dealers, they feel strange not pushing pills on you, like they missed a sale, failed.  They have no regard for your body, trust me! I have had over 16 years of experience. On 300mg, my thyroid was bad, after 3 weeks at this dose, even though too low per my doc to bring up #'s on blood test, he pushed for 900mg, the tiredness, constant dehydration, salty taste in mouth, then what it has already done to my thyroid (Hormones = Mood), Im done! BTW, never been so angry since I was on this drug, finally stopped to realize, since I was on Lithium very irritable.  It does not get rid of depression. It does turn you into a zombie.",2,25
Lithium,"I was on this for Bipolar II, but diagnosis later withdrawn. This drug.  Knocks.  You.  Out.  And it also gives you tremors, so don't plan to do precision anything if you're on it.  It dehydrates you and makes you have to pee a lot.",2,19
Lithium,"I started lithium nearly 2 years ago,  thyroid went almost instantly along with energy and about 10% of my hair.  Then followed by liver (they keep saying liver isn't affected but I never had a problem with my liver and had blood tests done 3 months before my lithium start). I have a huge personal event happen that shattered those around me but I am completely numb.  When you can't feel then you have to ask is it worth it.",4,24
Lithium,"I have been using lithium for over a year and it really made me like a normal me again in few months. I used to be very angry, anxious, sad and suicidal. Together with celexa. I was able to be like normal again but i gained 30lbs from my normal weight 110lbs. That is why i took one point off. I trained and just finished marathon. But my weight is not even a pound down. I just have my blood test done th today. Will see doctor tomorrow and see if i could reduce the dose for a better weight result.",9,20
Lithium,"It's like being extremely hung over eveyday.  Clouded head, no energy, diarrhea and dehydrated.   Not fun at all.  I guess I'll be manic.  Tremors like you've been on a 3 day bender.

Lithium,"I have been taking 1200mg daily (900mg daily 1/2 of the time), but for over 18 years.  This drug does appear to soften the lows and highs.  However extreme moods still occur while on this drug, it appears to be effective.  This seems to be the staple Bipolar drug, and many cocktails prescribed by doctors include this.  I have not seen any bad side effects from this, other than being very thirsty from time to time.  With that, I do carry more water weight than the average person.  I know this because I will often weigh myself before going to sleep, then go to the bathroom various times through the night and morning, and find that I lose upwards to 5 pounds.  The yearly or 6 month blood tests are annoying, but so far my kidneys are okay.",8,20
Lithium,"I am bipolar II. My problem is the severe depression. I have taken antidepressants in the past which didn't work. I don't have hallucinations or hear voices, but my depression is so severe that it feels like I have bugs crawling inside my brain. The top of my head feels like a heavy brick is sitting on top, and I experience numbess in my head and throughout my extremities. I believe I do experience delusional thought patterns combined with guilt. After adding lithium to my antidepressant, imipramine, my breakdowns are eliminated. It can take several weeks for these meds to lift the symptoms. I actually get better everyday until I am well, again. Lithium in combination of imipramine has saved my life! Side effects aren't bad. Lifesaver!",9,31
Lithium,Lithium has cut my suicidal thinking drastically and helped my sleep. For 20 years I have fantasized about suicide from between 25 times and 300 times a week consistently. I took latuda and lamictal for bipolar and had very little sleep on both and the suicidal thinking got too intense. Been on lithium for 3 months now and the suicidal thinking has diminished to between 0 and 5 times a week. Huge difference. Have not noticed any adverse side effects. I am on a regular sleep schedule now as well. Highly recommended for the overly suicidal thinker like me.,10,39
Lithium,"After being misdiagnosed and mistreated for 20 years, I finally understood that I am bipolar type 2. I noticed a huge difference on lithium (I don't have any other meds whatsoever now) the first day I took it as I immediately leveled out. The antidepressant effect took slightly longer to kick in but this medication has changed my life. I don't feel cut off like I did on SSRI meds and I don't have any side effects at all. All my blood work has been perfect and I am really pleased beyond any expectations with the effect and the total lack of side effects. I don't feel like I am on a medication at all - it feels like I have suddenly become normal.",10,59

Lithium,"Started treatment on Lithium in the midst of a major depressive episode. Started on 400mg and gradually titrated up to 1000mg. In short, I love this med. I've had very few side effects; I've gained weight but I think this is mainly due to Quetiapine which I take alongside Lithium. I still experience major shifts in mood, but lithium has made me far less suicidal, less inclined to self harm and has majorly improved my focus, concentration span, verbal dexterity and, in part, manic spells. I am now in what would normally be a manic phase in my cycle and, whilst I still feel a little jittery and excitable, it's far better than before. Only minor set back is my thyroid function is a little high, but I'm monitoring this with doc. Recommended.",8,35
Lithium,"I have Bipolar I mixed episodes, I've been on a number of medications in the past, but Lithium stands out as one of the worst in my case. I lived in a fog but also had some of the worst stomach issues as well. I gained quite a bit of weight too but the worst was the severe Acne I got from the drug. I never had acne like this in my life since than or before, so I know it was the medicine. It was painful, it felt like second degree burns, I went to see my doctor and all that smug @$$ said was that's one of the side effects unfortunately.  I don't mean to sound vain but a lot of self worth comes from the outside as well as the inside and while that shouldn't be the case it's a fact for me. Be informed, not all drugs work for everyone.",2,33
Lithium,I was diagnosed as bipolar in 2007. I've been on and off a plethora of different meds. In Nov. 2015 my nurse practitioner put me on 600mg/day of Lithium Carb CR.

My nurse pract. said the blood test looked bad for my kidneys and thyroid. My pcp said the opposite.  I didn't care; I was ALIVE again!

I can finally admit it. I have bipolar disorder.  Nothing else. Not anxiety. Calm. Quiet and calm head. No depression  or mania. I want to feel and look my best all the time. And it only took a naturally occurring element, abundant in our universe.. To flip the switch. Although there is no cure. Just how I feel.",10,68

I by accident found out I was bipolar, I know sounds strange but it started when my doc prescribed Tegretol for neuralgia. It didn't help for it but instead got rid of my migraines, lifted my mood and was taking me out of the depression, was working great but then became allergic to it, I'm now on Lithium and I pray that it works just as great as Tegretol.  I currently take Adderall, Lithium, Restoril and Doxycycline. I'm prescribed Zoloft but stopped taking it because I didn't feel any better.",6,17

No problems to start except thirsty, but lately had numb tingly arm which was scary,  I was told lithium level was 0.6 (should be fine) then a bit later had a hideous kind of fit, (I wrongly linked 2 a cocktail?) where I suddenly felt totally drugged but kind of clear headed, terrified, Vision (but not eyes) flicking side to side v fast on and off for 2-3 hrs - horrifying. When I cld see I googled and Very Bad Diseases like Parkinson's came up. (Eyes checked -fine) Then next day lost ability to swallow at all for about 5 mins (dysfagia?) also Terrifying.

Lithium,I was diagnosed with rapid cycling bipolar disorder about a year ago. After many failed medications my psychiatrist prescribed me lithium 600mg.  The side effects were brutal for the first month but have faded away to only occasional mild nausea.

Lithium,"Probably the worst medication I've ever been on. Made me feel completely disconnected from reality and dissociate all the time, made me nauseous, did not help with my suicidal thoughts or impulses at all (in fact I was MORE suicidal on it).

My highs ranged from acting highly inappropriate in public places to my highly suicidal lows of which I've been hospitalized. My psychiatrist quickly put me on the  Gold Standard for bipolar treatment. I titrated up. My first dose was at 300mg then 600mg and now, 900mg.  My dosage at 900 makes my emotional roller coaster a smooth and highly manageable kiddie ride.  Side effects I've experienced are an increase in appetite and weight, a small amount of hair loss and a bit of fatigue.

Lithium,I have had depression forever and after failed SSRIs mania started to occur. Luckily I was already seeing a psychiatrist he tried me on Seroquel which made me way too sleepy and then Lithium which stopped both mania and depression. Although it doesn't cure bipolar so I still have manic and depressive episodes during stressful times but they are much more minor now I'm on Lithium. Only side effects are tremors for me but they are fairly minor.,8,38
Lithium,I take 600mg lithium the only side effect I have are the tremors. Have been on it for the past year thought I was taking it for 5 years when I was first diagnosed with bipolar 13 years ago. I wanted off it then because I was doing well and I continued to do so for many years afterward until the depression came back. Then after trying different meds that were unsuccessful I went back on lithium. I'm amazed at some of the very high doses some are taking as mine was increased to 800mg I wasn't even on that dosage a week and had to reduce back to 600mg again as I went toxic. I remember Depakote causing my hair to fall out and it was an extremely good med other than that.,9,23

Well being in NSW it gets so hot, and i am not good  in the heat, the chemist warned me, and its true. No strenuous exercise, it knocks me around. Even long walks it tells on my body.   Mood wise- i still have lapses but i am not swapping Lithium for anything.  Nor Seroquel, im content.",9,26
Lithium,"My only two complaints about lithium are the potentially detrimental effects on the kidneys and the nausea. I first started taking lithium in college but stopped because of excessive nausea and vomiting.

My Father, brother, sister all have Bipolar 1, I've been denying it for quite a while but recently the highs have been too great, and the lows equally opposite, scheming a way to off myself so my wife gets life insurance.  This is all about 10 years over due if it works, I'm pessimistic.

It would upset my stomach and dehydrate me terribly.  After going on and off of it for years, I recently had a nurse practitioner switch me to the lithium carbonate ER  (extended release).  I now take the whole dose before bed and don't have the upset stomach anymore.  Still thirsty and on the numb side.... but functioning better.",7,19

I tried going off of it for a week because I thought I didnt need it, and found myself crying nightly/ getting overly emotional.",10,45
Lithium,"I was diagnosed with bipolar type I in 2008.  I sort of knew that I was bipolar, and I also heard that lithium was a terrible drug (thanks to the teachings of a very misinformed individual).  I tried 3 mood stabilizers over the past 7 years.  Each of the mood stabilizers was an anti seizure med.  Finally, I had to go on lithium.  Within one week, I felt better than I had ever felt before.  I suffered from horrible irritability all this time.  My irritability is now gone. My own son said that I am lot nicer now. Hearing my son say that made this switch very worth while.",10,67
Lithium,"Diagnosed bipolar 2 although my hypomania would get quite extreme and I think I was headed for mania with the last bout. Took away suicidal thoughts almost entirely. Puts you in a kind of haze, but a very functional haze, not a 'zombie' feeling; It's good for paranoia too. And the best thing is you still have highs and lows they are just less intense! YAY not over medicated. So far have noticed thinning hair and minor scalp pain but when it comes to mood I am STABLE. Taking with Seroquel also but only 100mg as I'm weaning off the seroquel. Maybe the seroquel in addition is causing the side effects, unsure. I do feel that lithium is effecting my skin and hair though.  Lowers sex drive but doesn't get rid of it entirely.",8,33
Lithium,"I am 16 years old. I have been to over 20 in and outpaient mental health hospitals, including residential. I had severe depression, severe anxiety, and the last year before I was diagnosed, extreme anger. I was suicidal, homicidal, I self harmed, I had an eating disorder, I dealt with death, abuse, bullying, everything. I attempted suicide four times. I barely made it each time. I had all the symptoms. low self-esteem, self harm, eating disorders, isolation, mania, the suicidal/homicidal thoughts, I was trying to use drugs, I skipped school, I tried to kill people, I had insomnia. I finally, after two years, found this miracle little pill.",10,72
Lithium,"I have been on lithium for 14 years. I take 2100 mg a day and almost all of my suicidal obsessions have gone away. It controls most of my mania but only puts a small dent in the depression. If I miss a dose I will start into mania, so don't miss doses. The only side effect I have is tremor. I take 3 other psych meds and have always been amazed how clear headed I usually am on lithium.",10,36
Lithium,"Have been diagnosed since 15, am 35 now. Went through copius medicines, being the medicinal guinea pig made me not want to deal with the mental health problems i faced. Years unmedicated, and the destruction got to me. Two years ago I slipped into the depression, I tried going back in meds. All made me sick, or flat, dizzy or angry. Last Dr said lithium, at first I was scared, I heard a lot of bad things. Ok, life was sooo bad, suicidal ideations were running me, so decided to try it at 300Mg 3x a day.  I started Tuesday, its only Friday, and my thought are clear, and I feel the best I have felt in years. Any other medicine takes weeks to work. This Is amazing!!!! It won't work for everyone. But for those of us it does, it us literally a life saver.",10,56
Lithium,I am writing mostly because after having so many people tell me their horror stories about Lithium I was looking for something positive and found this site.  I was prescribed Lithium after my first manic episode and it has helped to level me out.  I was also on Olanzapene which I blame for the 20lbs I gained (being in the hospital for a month and then snacking obsessively and not excercising didn't help).  My thoughts of suicide are a lot less  for the first time in a long time and I feel generally more stable than I did even on Effexor which I was on for years.,10,33
Lithium,"Ive read many times how Lithium has effected people with its side effects. Me, also. My specialist change me to QUILONUM SR. It is a slow release Lithium and 100 times better.  No upset stomach, no thirst cravings. Still same rules, eg don't be in the sun, don't over do any exercise or perspiring.  Its still Lithium salts, same precautions.  But I am back onto a normal Lithium as my dose changed, and the SR can't be cut in half. The standard Lithium is playing around with my stomach, yes, I'm thirster BUT I eat more.  I eat sweet things on it. I'm on both SR and Standard.",9,22
Lithium,"I've been taking Lithium for two years now for my bipolar- depression. It's good for stability but I don't feel like myself. I never cry, never smile, and I'm not as outgoing as I was. I feel like a machine. I can't drink. I always have to be tied down to my pill bottle. Next year I'm going to college, I feel so much older with this responsibility. Now I'm questioning if my stability is worth my freedom.",8,42
Lithium,"Lithium was a God send. It elevated my mood to prevent suicidal thoughts and prevented manic episodes. I had to stop taking it because I had urinary problems unassociated with the lithium, but which were taxing my kidneys and my doctor suggested I stop taking it to prevent further damage.  It was hard to stop taking because it worked so well for me.  I miss it.  I had no other symptoms except I liked water a lot more.",7,35
Lithium,"I am diagnosed with schizoaffective Bipolar. I spent 8 years trying every psychiatric medication on the market to no avail. I never found stability my life was made up of rapid cycles of extreme moods one week I would be happy confident and secure the next week I would be extremely depressed often suicidal had 6 serious suicide attempts and was hospitalized 22 times. Nothing worked at least not for long. I was put on lithium 2 years ago along with the two other medications, I was on an antidepressant and an antipsychotic. Lithium saved my life I have had no suicidal thoughts, my life is no longer ruled by extreme moods although I can be a little emotional at times I am able to remain logical and in control something I could never do before.",10,46
Lithium,"Lithium saved my life by suppressing totally my suicidal thoughts. I would say it works moderately well for my hypomanias (we still had to add an antipsychotic) and moderately well for my depression symptoms (we had to add an antidepressant). I dont feel drowsy, numb, slow or zombie. There is only one side effect I HATE : the tremors. Even Inderal doesnt remove them completely. A single cup of coffee makes them 2X worse.",7,25
Lithium,My manias have definitely been 'filed down' so far.... Though I now have mixed states and anger is highly apparent during mania. Basically I used to have a pure 'joy' mania. But now it's that and quick rage. Though I'm unsure if Lithium is to blame here for I've always had anger issues.,6,27
Lithium,"I've been in Lithium for 5 years. For the first 4 years I had a positive outcome. But for the past year I've experenced rapid cycling and have been hospitalized twice. I'm now taking a combination of 1500mg of Lithium, 20mg of Prozac and 10mg of Saphris.  I'm hoping the depression lifts and my moods will stabilize.  Feeling very overwhelmed.",0,38
Lithium,<b>Lithobid (lithium):</b>			 My manias have definitely been 'filed down' so far.... Though I now have mixed states and anger is highly apparent during mania. Though I'm unsure if Lithium is to blame here for I've always had anger issues. But it seems more intense.,0,14
Lithium,"Lithium provides a ton of stability for ultra-rapid cyclers.  The drawbacks are it interacts with almost everything in certain ways and it is fairly hard on the liver.  My primary care physician and psychiatrist work together to try to provide options that won't affect my liver as much as a result.  Because of the amount of stability it provides, I don't think I'll ever be able to go off of it.  I may be able to lower it by trying changes to other things.  But it just works too well at giving stability.  I don't like when the pharmacist says it out loud because it's a dead giveaway of what you're taking it for.",10,28
Lithium,I have been taking lithium (300mg) for about 2-3 weeks now and it has taken away my mania and leveled me out. I can see that is is working and helping me with my insomnia as well. A few down sides: it makes me nauseous when taken without food and enough water and my sex drive is non-existent now. Kind of frustrating. I am also taking Lamictal (200mg) and have been for about a year so I know it's not the Lamictal that is causing these side effects.,5,44
Lithium,"I've been on lithium for about a month now. I was put on it by the doctor in the hospital after a major manic episode. This is the first time in my life that I have no have thoughts of harming myself. My mood is stable, life is easier and I am not suffering. I had some side effects of nausea and vomiting but with a reduction in my level and always taking it with food these side effects have subsided. I am still getting used to being stable after over three decades of illness but this is getting better every day. I recommend giving lithium a try if nothing else has worked.",9,65
Lithium,"I have struggled with bipolar depression for very long time almost 6 years. I was in denial for quite a long. Until I started hearing things and thinking things I heard or read were speaking about me.  About fours years on and off. The Issue that I had was that I didn't trust medication because I felt there was no such thing as bipolar disorder.  I met a great girl and got married and she helped me take Lithium consistently and soon after I had a miraculous transformation from it. I could think clearly, talk straight, listen, and take care of myself. Everything improved dramatically. I was paranoid anymore. Also, the feelings of death and depression went away and I could see past myself.  Lithium has changed my entire life.",10,100
Lithium,"Lithium was great for my intrusive thoughts as of suicidal and homicidal, cleared them up within three days. Had to stop taking it due to the bad headaches and other side effects. Now trying Depakote so far so good. Overall I hope lithium works for others.",3,34
Lithium,"I've was dubious about lithium and didn't want it. Time came that it was a choice left. At first I had nausea, and thirst. My doctor out me on a XR brand and it was better.  I can honestly say today, I don't know if it's working or not.  It is such a medicine that just does what it needs to do.  But a warning is- watch your salts either on your plate or in the sun.  I was told by the chemist and then I became aware when one day, I was out in the heat and walking around. I felt faint after a while. Next day I felt washed out.  And this has happened a few times.   Lithium is based on salts and this can play a little chaos.  Especially in the heat.",10,46
Lithium,"I have been on Lithium for several months now for Bipolar I. Wow! It helps. Drawback: you will feel sick if you dont drink enough water. Also I gained 30 pounds in about 4 months. I felt ravishingly hungry all the time. That part is not fun, however I can function properly. What lithium doesnt cover the therapy does. I might have a chance at normalcy.",10,46
Lithium,"I have been on lithium for 5 months now. Worst part is feeling so flat on it. I take lithium 900mg, Zyprexa 10mg and lorazepam 1-2 mg daily. I do feel the lithium is working, but my moods are still not stable. I hope things level out more for me. I have been on carbamazepine for 17 years, and it just stopped working.",7,16
Lithium,Was extremely suicidal and had ECT treatment for several weeks. Then put on lithium for maintenance therapy 300x2 daily for now. I Think I've found the perfect recipe for S/I. Never have I felt so good and have enjoyed being alive. I recommend ECT and lithium for anyone struggling with S/I. I've tried everything else for past 15 years and this is the ticket.,9,39
Lithium,I have depressive bipolar 2 which never is a huge issue until there's less Sun due to it combining with my seasonal mood disorder to send me over the edge. I started taking lithium in January and I recently have just stopped (July) so about 7 solid months or so. Granted this worked great I felt more clear headed the first couple months except it messed my stomach up horrible in combination with my irritable bowel syndrome. Plus my periods turned brown and would be two weeks late every time which is horrible nerve wrecking. My hormones completely lost it and still have  yet to go back to normal. Granted I'm only 18 and I could be growing once more and I've changed my acne routines but my acne completely changed making my skin.,5,14
Lithium,"Didn't give it much of a chance - 2 weeks. Just felt lousy on it - dizzy, clumsy, not any benefits. In retrospect, should have stayed with it. Still the gold standard for Bipolar 1, which is not really me. Blood tests required, etc.",3,19
Lithium,"When I originally got sick with insomnia and mania, I was prescribed Seroquel. 5 years later was admitted to the hospital and a student doc suggested I try lithium.  It kills fast onset mania quickly and fortunately have minor ill effects from it. Lost precision hand eye coordination for playing sports like baseball, that's the only issue I have had with it. And minor sun sensitivity. Its also good being a natural substance on the table of elements so it's not a synthetic medicine.   Very lucky to be on a low level that works so no need for constant blood monitoring.",8,34
Lithium,"Prescribed 1200mg of lithium for bipolar 1, alongside 800mg of Seroquel (quetiapine). Problems early on with lithium  toxicity due to a blood pressure medicine, once sorted out this medicine is awesome. I still feel happy and a little sad at times but it has removed the scare out of auditory and visual hallucinations.",0,24
Lithium,"Hell for many years now.  2 months ago I was once again fetal positioned in a laundry basket rocking back and forth in the attic and I finally said enough is enough%u2026I am going to get help. I am a rapid cycler-about every 10 days my episodes would begin again-I had about 5 good days/month. I never wanted to be zombiefied by medicine so, I reluctantly and VERY defensively went to the doctor and asked for help. They gave me Lithium and I can't believe the change! I finally feel free for the first time in my life. I am on a lower dose than some. I still have some symptoms, but feeling them is allowing me to work through them, and also NOT lose my creativity. Only side effect is that I walk into things- annoying.",9,88
Lithium,"I have been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and I have been on lithium for a week and it has instantly turned me into a lifeless zombie! I have no feeling except depression now. I have no energy to do anything. I've tried Lamictal and Depakote but they didn't calm the anger outbursts. The only plus is I have lost 5lbs! I'm at the point of giving up. I've previously been on Zoloft, Prozac, Paxil and Lexapro...all separately. These worked for depression to an extent but not for the mania.",0,36
Lithium,"I had been on lamotrigine for nearly 10 years and I noticed that slowly over time it was losing its effectiveness, and my episodes had become more and more extreme, to the point of one of my depressive episodes becoming psychotic in nature.  Then I was hospitalized and put on Lithium. After a month on the medication, and two weeks stable, my initial fears of lithium have faded. The medication has given me some unwanted side effects such as vision changes, hand tremors, muscle twitching but for the mental stability this medicine has given me... it's all worth it.  My psychotic thoughts and depressive episode has mostly ended, and the blood tests are a pain but I highly recommend anyone with Bipolar, especially Bipolar I to be open minded.",10,57
Lithium,"<b>Lithobid (lithium):</b>			 Many years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar ll. Lithium was my doctor's first choice. Not even sure how effective it was. The side effects were awful. I could not work, I lost down to 95 pounds. I was so weak I had difficulty climbing stairs. I shook so bad I could not sign my own name. Then my doctor started to add all sorts of medicines to counteract the side effects. I became hypothyroid had to take medicines for that, tremor had to take medicines for that (didn't work well). Dr. decreased dose (didn't help much). I was on leave from work for 12 weeks. Finally stopped the lithium. It took awhile for my Dr. to believe my problems with this medicine because they were not typical. Those 12 weeks were the worst.",0,60
Lithium,"Currently on Lithicarb 500mg taken as 2 x 250mg tablets taken 1 morning and one night. Was bumped up to 750mg but reduced back after severe dry skin and digestive discomfort as side effects.  Was finally put on lithium after previously being misdiagnosed with just depression and general anxiety &amp; put on Venlafaxine which exacerbated my mania...hence was finally correctly diagnosed with bipolar.  Suicidal thoughts are now minimal and I got over the need to pee excessively which comes with increasing your fluid intake after first starting my meds. Now I am 4 months in &amp; I have gained weight but that doesn't bother me as much as my loss of creativity &amp; general lack of motivation. On the plus side, this doesn't bother me as much as it should.",8,44
Lithium,I've been taking Lithium for three weeks now. For the first time in years I feel balanced. My major ups and downs have subsided and I do not have any side effects at all. Since I work in construction I monitor my fluid intake to avoid too much lithium in my system. The only drawback to drinking more water is having to frequent the restroom more often. My sleep has improved as well so all my previous medications are no longer needed. Currently I'm on 300mg 3x/day. Everybody's body responds differently to every medication out there and luckly I found something great.,10,79
Lithium,"I have been taking lithium bicarbonate for a little over 2 years. My dosage has fluctuated because I am also medicated for manic depression. I am 37 and have been medicated, on and off, for depression since I was 18. Lithium seems to help with my bipolar symptoms, not so much for my depression. My side effects have been: increased thirst, tremors, weight loss &amp; occasional stomach aches if I do not eat enough when I take my pills. I am fine with these so long as I feel 'normal.'  Frequent blood work is not bothersome as I understand they are screening for my own health...lithium toxicity levels, kidney functions, thyroid activity.",9,44
Lithium,I have taken lithium since I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 in 1993. I stopped taking it for 10 years and then started taking it again and it's been 6 years back on it. I wouldn't substitute this medication. It works very well. The correct dosage is what matters most. The therapeutic window is 0.6 to 1.2 just because the level is slightly lower isn't always bad. It's alright to manage some of the symptoms but when it gets above 1.2 toxicity becomes an issue. It has to be maintained properly. My only drawback is occasional hand tremors and in high doses it tends to dull personality.,9,45
Lithium,"I have found lithium works awesome for my depression/bipolar however the side effects are causing a problem. After couple weeks the nausea has not gone away.  I am losing my instant memory and found myself confused when doing or talking about a topic, I can't remember what I just said or heard.",6,65

Lithium,Lithium worked amazing wonders for me... for about a month. Then it stopped. I've been trying to get it to work again for two years.,0,25
Lithium,"Terrific against mania, haven't had a manic episode in 2 years. Also with barely any manic symptoms. However, for me it's not great against depression but does help a little. It also helped with suicidal tendencies.",9,45
Lithium,"In 4 weeks, lithium took me from constantly obsessing about suicide, to having almost no suicidal ideation. Minor side effects include extra urination, and minor nausea if taken without enough food.",10,54
Lithium,"I have been taking lithium since 1983, It has kept me stable but I miss the highs, my creative side has disappeared, can't concentrate and I lose interest in things and I have been told I must take lithium for the rest of my life.",8,83
Lithium,"I have suffered with bipolar disorder as long as I can remember its been one manic episode after another. I'm 31 now and have been on lithium for 3 and a half weeks in now and for the last 3 days have felt the best I ever have, I feel stable and finally am free of the need to self medicate. I know its only early days and have had some side effects such as extreme thirst, minor weight gain and hate the blood tests but this is a small price to pay for finally feeling well. Hope other people with this illness have the same success as I'm getting. All the best.",10,92
Lithium,Lithium has been very good for me.Like every medication that I have ever took it seems not to work as well after a year or so.I have been Bipolar since 2004 and depressed since 1984.,9,29
Lithium,"This drug has saved two of my very good friends from what I really belive would have been both of their deaths. The 1st friend was an emotional wreck, and the 2nd friend was a suicidal cutter, and BOTH have gotten their lives back and are on the right path with this medication. Both did gain some weight and got some acne, but when you look at the alternative, I think they are both beyond grateful for it all! As am I, so I think if someone you know is like this, please get them to a doctor who knows about bi-polar disorder, and get them onto this medication, it really truly DOES WORK for a lot of folks suffering through their life, when there is NO NEED to! Help them! WE ALL DESERVE TO LIVE A SOMEWHAT NORMAL LIFE!",9,94
Lithium,"<b>Eskalith (lithium):</b>			 I've been on lithium for a long time for bipolar 1. Use as part of combination therapy since I can't tolerate doses over 600 mg/day (start shaking, skin numbness). Works very well for treating manic side of things, racing thoughts.",0,41

Lithium,I've tried everything. Lithium is only medicine that works.,10,31
Lithium,"I've been on probably 15 different medications in the 10 years I've been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Lithium is the only one where my mood truly feels stable. It allows me to do everyday things without the hassle of fighting myself, my mood and everyone around me. I did get off it a few years ago in a state of Depression, but am now back on it. Every other mood stabilizer I've tried hasn't compared.",9,43
Lithium,Lithium is the best medicine out there for Bi-Polar.  I have severe Bi-Polar with Rapid Cycling and have been on every medicine out there.  This is the only medicine that has worked.  I was always afraid to take it because of weight gain and the tests they have to run to check your lithium levels.  I'm glad I decided to give it a try.  I had the shaky hands side effect really bad I couldn't even write a sentence.   My Doctor then prescribed me propranolol and after one day of taking it I have no more tremors.  I take them 4 times a day. Make sure you eat before you take the Lithium.  Good luck.,10,42
Lithium,"I've tried almost all of the Bipolar Meds available out there - Geodon, Depakote, Lamictal, Seroquel, Zyprexa, etc. All of these made me stupid and/or fat and were not very effective for my depression. This past year I sunk to a new low of serious depression - I told my PDoc that I need something different because I was a lifeless, delusional, an anxious zombie and was suicidal. His secretary said she would forward the message to him - 3 Times. No reply from him at all - I had to find a new doctor and he put me on 300mg Lithium (went up to 600mg 2 weeks later) - about 1 month into my new treatment, it feels like a switch was flipped. This is the best medicine I've ever had and I hope it continues - not many options left for me.",10,86
Lithium,"As long as I take  lithium capsules and NOT the tablets, I have no side effects.  Presently on 900 mg a day.  Doesn't make me sleepy as I have insomnia.  Tablet gave me a salty taste in my mouth.  I drink about one more 16.9 oz bottled water than normal.  Stabilized my moods tremendously, easy to take.  I take with a protein shake, almond milk, applesauce but not on an empty stomach or then it gives me a slight stomach ache.",10,36

Lithium,"<b>Lithobid (lithium):</b>			 Changed my life totally and completely. I used to be on a emotional roller coaster...up and down, over and over again. This medicine just brings me to a mellow state. I let nothing get to me anymore. I never get hostile, and that was my norm. I actually think this medicine saved my life because I was so tired of being emotional and angry!  This was my last resort. I tried everything else that the doctor wanted me to try and none of that phased me. I recommend this to anyone with bipolar.",0,75
Lithium,"I am 26 years of age now but my mental illness of depression and panic attacks started when I was 15. I was then put on 20 mg Celexa and Klonopin 1 mg. As I got older it was like I could never control my emotions, I was up and down all the time emotionally and could never concentrate on college. So they put me on Adderal 15mg to help my concentration issue...so that was solved. I still was riding the emotion roller coaster though. My doctor recommended a mood stabilizer, Depakote...didn't work for me at all. I dealt with it for a while, but there was no in-between. I eventually had mental breakdown and within the next few months my counselor was talking to me about lithium. I was terrified of it but tried and I am the most stable I have ever been.",10,55
Lithium,"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 3 years ago during a hospitalization. Was put on 600mg Seroquel and 200mg Lamictal. Switched doctors and they decided to replace my medicines with lithium. I don't know why but it made my condition 10 times worse and I got very sick.  Fever, vomiting, nausea, drowsiness, fatigue, excessive thirst and urination. Plus it makes my mood swings much worse and shortened my patience and turned my depression to rage. Gave uncontrollable twitches and body movements and shaky hands. Though I have been off it for a year. My case is probably an anomaly as it seems to work wonders for everyone else.",1,33
Lithium,"I LOVE LITHIUM!  Was terrified to try it but no side effects. No weight gain as I have not been depressed and staring at the wall in a fetal position unable to move.  If I take it, it prevents mania (can tell when I forget) and depression.  Drink more water - I try to drink 60 ounces a day and sweat more but no other side effects but I make sure to exercise usually 30 minutes a day. Got bad news that should have thrown me into depression but since on lithium was able to talk normally, work out a solution, and function - THANKS LITHIUM.",10,59
Lithium,"Lithium did well for me for more than 15 years, but then the creatinine levels went up and I had to switch. Eight years later now, I have hyperparathyroid symptoms, at least that is what it looks like. That is a long time after stopping it to see elevated calcium levels, etc.  But I have no regrets. The last 30 years have been stable. Depakote keeps me well. Just be aware that this could happen.",9,26
Lithium,I have read all the comments and Lithium seems to work. My doctor started me on 450mgs a day for a week and then wants me to take 900mgs a day after a week. In addition to that I take 300mgs of Wellbutrin  and occasionally 0.5 mgs of Klonopin.,9,14
Lithium,I have tried everything for my bipolar type II condition. After 4 different mood stabilizers I suggested Lithium to my doctor because I took it at age 17 for a major depression. I seem to have a low tolerance to medications so I started very low. I began with 35 mg of Lithium and recently went up to 75mg (half a pill) and started to have problems. I have hip joint pain. Swollen feet (edema) and hands. Aching flank pain (kidneys??) and it does nothing for my depression symptoms. But the good news is that it sure does keep my brain calmed down. I was having mixed states that was probably due to the antidepressant I was on and they have all vanished with the Lithium. I really do like the way it works.,9,18
Lithium,"<b>Eskalith (lithium):</b>			 I have been bipolar my whole life and nothing has worked better than Lithium.  The side effects were quite minimal, feel queasy and difficulty reading because eyes jerk.  All went away after approximately 2 to 3 weeks.",0,27
Lithium,"I've been on this medicine for 2 weeks now. I haven't really noticed a change in moods just yet. I guess because I'm taking Celexa and Elavil too. We're weaning me off Elavil. But I have surely felt the side effects. I've got some slight tremors in my hands, cotton mouth worse than ever, and my heart races at times. But my appetite has decreased since I've been on it. Before adding lithium, Elavil made me feel good, but put 20lbs on me in 2 months. That's why I'm coming off it. I just had my blood drawn to check my salt levels, so we shall see how that turns out. I was diagnosed bipolar in early 2003 and have been off and on just about everything for it. So my new doctor put me on lithium to help me. I'm glad I read about the side effects others have posted.",8,16
Lithium,This medicine is wonderful. I gave it a 9 only because I can never quench my thirst and it makes me sensitive to bright lights and phone/computer/TV screens after awhile. Otherwise it's amazing. I feel so stable and happy. It's almost eerie. I have been suicidal and a cutter for a long time and it has lifted those desires. I really hope this magic lasts.,9,37
Lithium,<b>Eskalith-CR (lithium):</b>			 I have suffered from depression since I was 8 years old.  I finally started going to therapy and taking antidepressants and various other psychotropic medications with no luck.  Finally at 39 my internal medicine doctor suggested I try lithium CR 300mg once a day along with a SSRI antidepressant.  I am going to be 45 next month and have only been in the hole five times.  My doctor ups my SSRI during these episodes until I'm stabilized then I go back down when I feel it's safe.  Lithium has been a life-saving medicine with minimal side-effects.  Thirst and acne are worth it.,0,35

I have more acne than I used to, and the worst one. I've gained about 25 pounds which for me wasn't good I was already overweight. Oh and I haven't had a period for almost three months now (not pregnant) my doctor thinks Lithium might be to blame. I'm only 25 by the way, so I should still have a period. Besides all of this Lithium was the best thing to ever happen to me.",0,33
Lithium,"Lithium brought me out of a year long rapid-cycling episode that almost destroyed my marriage, my work and my life. I think it's an excellent first aid medicine for bipolar disorder. After about 3 months of feeling amazing relief, I felt emotionally flat-lined, so I worked with my doctor and he reduced my lithium dose to 600 mg and added 150 mg of Lamictal, 1.5 mg of clonazepam to soothe anxiety, and finally 20 mg of Adderall to combat persistent mild depression.

It did finally go away after a few months, then the fun came in the spring.  I went into a mania, shopping, spending a lot of money.  Once I got 3 speeding tickets in one hour.  That's when I knew something was wrong and was luckily diagnosed as Manic Depressive (Bi Polar).  I was put on Lithium and within 2 weeks felt much, much better.

Lithium,"I've been on Lithium for over four years. I enjoy the stability it gave me and I haven't had a manic episode since starting lithium. My problem is dehydration. I avoid water and choose flavored beverages to cover up that metallic taste. My Lithium level is always high as a result.

The hand tremor is the worst side effect by far, I take a medication just to treat that alone.",8,33
Lithium,"My husband just started taking Lithium last week and we both have seen a HUGE difference. Yesterday he told me he feels 'fine' and not like he doesn't want to be on this earth any longer. He's been on multiple antidepressants over the years...none of which have worked. His new psychiatrist seems to have found the right drug. I hope he continues to improve.

Lithium,I was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder 18 months ago and put on lithium 600mgs a day and Seroquel 300mg at night.  The lithium has been wonderful to stabilize my moods and keep me from feeling so down and depressed. I eventually weaned myself from the Seroquel because it made me lethargic and I had weight gain that I contributed to it not the lithium.  I now exercise - run 3 miles a day to help me release any pent up anger or negative energy and it works wonders.  Lithium maybe one of the oldest bi-polar medicines but it is tried and true.,10,45
Lithium,It's the best I've even taken for Bipolar. I have been on several medicines before Lithium but it's the best. My doctor has had to change the dosage a few time because of my level being too high and because of another doctor changing my medicines. It's very important to have Lab work done while on Lithium to have the level checked.,9,27
Lithium,Although this drug has left me with an underactive thyroid I would totally recommend it. I have not been this stable in the last 10 years of treatment with other drugs. Mania and large mood swings are no longer blighting my life.,8,30

Lithium,"I started to take lithium along with Manerix in Jan/Feb 2007.  I was diagnosed with Chronic Depression.  I was hospitalized for six months before they found the right medicine that worked for me.  They tried so many anti-depressant that did not work until these. Now they think I might be bipolar because the lithium was the one that worked. I did have some side effects like dry mouth, tremors, had trouble with doing small things with my hands like writing. But in time this went away. Lithium did cause hypothyroidism in the 2nd year. That will not go away even if I go off Lithium.  The Endocrinologist has had trouble balancing my thyroid which made me gain 30 pounds in 2 and a half years.",8,28
Lithium,"I have been on Lithium for 16 years. The only complaint I have is the weight gain, it has increasingly gotten harder to lose. Also, the last 2 years the hand tremors have gotten bad. It is very noticeable. I have considered trying another medicine with the help of my doctor.",0,20

Lithium,"After almost dying of chronic alcoholism I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on lithium in May 2006 (currently on 750 mg per day). I was also taking Seroquel and Imipramine.  I put on 50 lbs and my wife kept commenting on how I was listless and zoned out.  This was a big problem because I write fiction for a living, which requires energy and alertness.  With my doctor I started tweaking the Seroquel and Imipramine and finally quit them altogether (the info sheets for both state they may result in weight gain).

I am also taking 15mg of Buspirone and 20mg of Celexa. I never thought I would be able to really live until now. My moods are not extreme anymore and I don't have suicidal thoughts.

Finally I went to a shrink and he worked with me until the medication Tegretol brought me out of the depressed state and I went manic. The doctor upon knowing this manic state, prescribed 900mg of lithium per day with the 400mg of Tegretol and I have been normal for 15 years. I have to take these medicines forever.

Positives so far are less rumination and constant thinking. Less daydreaming. It doesnt affect my actual ability to think. I havent gone manic on this yet.

I would nearly pass out anytime I even moved. I was stuck in bed for a whole week and had to miss work. I did not notice any good effects, but since I was so sick I wasn't particularly paying attention to my mental status. I only took the meds for 3 days before I had to stop because I literally could not function. I hope this was not a common occurrence and others are able to get relief from this medication- but for me it brought on very very bad side effects.",1,2

Compulsive gambling addiction is a mental health disorder itself.  Who'd have thought that the NHS would prescribe this dangerous drug that can cause it? Sounds ridiculous but true.  There was a guy with Parkinsons prescribed it in England, went full on the National Lottery online games and scratch cards etc ... but won his case for not being advised properly of the potential side effects and got most of the losses back.

Less than a year later I was hospitalized again and at that point I was introduced to Abilify. Three years passed during which I was stable. I then went off of it which led to my third and final hospitalization. Ever since then I took the 20mg tablets religiously and would soon combine it with Lamictal. This combo has worked wonders for me. Years ago a doctor told me that Im on the Rolls Royce of bipolar medication and I firmly agree.

I will say that it cured my depression completely, so for that I am grateful. As far as my anxiety, sleep, and overall mood it has not improved. Moving up in dosage caused more restlessness and moving down to 2.5mg or less made me tired and didn't do much for my mood. This med didn't work for me but its not the worst med, give it a shot.

Well the pharmacy was out of stock of Latuda and I had just finished my taper off of Abilify,  so I was about 4-5 days off of any mood stabilizer.  And now I can say that although it may not have been as effective as when I first went on it, it definitely made a difference!  Since the second week of my taper (down to 5 mg, then 2) I applied for some more credit cards and thought nothing of it.  In the past 2 days, I have maxed out all those credit cards.  It wasn't until last night I put the connection to me not being on anything.  I gained a little weight on it, but at the same time,  I allowed myself to eat what I wanted and didn't exercise.

I did notice that I felt less depressed, could focus better, and did not experience such strong mood episodes.   However, within a month I was experiencing this extremely intense paranoia that I never had before.  I had chest pains and headaches regularly.  I couldn't eat and often felt sick because of how anxious I was.  So yes, Abilify did benefit me alongside this weird side effect.  My doctor had me convinced the medication wasn't causing the paranoia, it was just me, but as soon as I stopped taking it the headaches, chest pains, and bursts of anxiety have stopped.

The depression had lasted around 3 years with constant suicidal ideation and a general mood so low that I couldn't get happiness from virtually anything.

I am now enjoying socialising and exercise again, and looking forward to starting a new job in a couple of months. It has also helped relieve the obsessional-style thoughts I was having. It's hard to explain my own surprise with not being depressed anymore.

I continued to have some paranoia and whenever I was more upset than usual, Id have breakthrough hallucinations.

At the 2 week mark I had to leave work two days in a row, customers were terrifying me, my pulse was 180!  By this time my anxiety slowly shot up so high I was paralyzed. I couldn't walk across the room. I literally was stuck in a chair. Everything was extremely terrifying. Just sitting I was afraid to move. Once I saw my dr, found out I had suffered a severe panic attack that sent me into an anxiety attack for TWO weeks!  I was ill for six months. Read the pamphlet with the drug , it lists SEVERE ANXIETY!",0,16

Aripiprazole,<b>Abilify (aripiprazole):</b>			 Taking abilify about 10 years. Does cause weight gain and for myself no sexual desire.  The swings from manic to depression continue but are manageable.  Do not take yourself off this drug cold turkey.  Caused many psychotic episodes for me which disappeared when returning to the drug.  Sad movies no longer make me cry. Don't have great joyful moments either.  I don't stagger around like when I was on lithium.  I do have hypertension not always controlled by the 3 antihypertensive I'm taking.,0,9

I have developed gallstones, have a fatty liver and have high triglycerides. It is definitely not because of my diet. I was a vegan for 23 years and I am very strict with what I eat. I now have to get my gallbladder removed and I think it has to do with taking psychiatric drugs over the years. It is well noted now that abilify causes gallstones, a fatty liver and high triglycerides.

Found out this week that Abilify causes weight gain and it's the culprit - not an injury I'd been blaming it on. And I'd blamed myself and started disordered eating out of desperation. It gets rid of my mood swings and crying for no reason. I feel generally good except foggy while at work where I do not enjoy being. Unmotivated at work. Moderately motivated in personal life - better than in years. Absolutely quitting this drug. Now for the withdrawal I wasn't aware of when I decided to take it... I think this is a dangerous drug for anyone who is prone to weight gain or diabetes. Can't believe my pdoc didn't say anything when I complained about weight gain last time.,0,14

Took Benadryl and became calm and sleepy. My manic and depression episodes were usually on a day-to-day basis whereas when I took abilify, it shifted within an hour or so.

I experienced dramatic improvement within DAYS and continued relief from symptoms which often left me homebound and sobbing with no interest or ability to work or socialize, even perform minor chores and the anxiety became crippling.

The dose was 5 mg since I was experiencing a mixed episode with some paranoid thoughts.  I didn't notice it being particularly helpful for depression.  Maybe there was some slight mood stabilization, but not enough for me to really feel relief.  I was taken off of it for this reason.  Also, even at 5 mg, it caused me some restlessness and a sensation similar to a headache.  It's expensive too.",0,7
Aripiprazole,"<b>Abilify (aripiprazole):</b>			 I have taken Abilify for around 5-6 years. I initially was prescribed it at the age of 15 which is way too early in my opinion.

Don't try and get off this drug on your own, it can have horrible consequences. I'm not totally sure what was the Abilify withdrawal and what was my illness, but I had some very extreme mania, that may have been a side effect of withdrawal. Overall Abilify is a very serious drug, don't take it lightly, and I wouldn't recommend it for depression.

Abilify did cause me to feel a bit dazed or doped, which also caused sleepiness during the day.

All of the others had terrible side effects.  Neurontin, Zyprexa, Lithium, Tegretol, you name it I've tried it.  It is very hard to get someone who is bipolar to take medicines due to the fact there are so many side effects.  In my opinion Abilify does what is says it supposed to do with no side effects.  Of course everyone is different.  This medicine works.  It keeps me from going high or low.  Most bipolar patients should probably be on an antidepressant, which is only my opinion since everyone is unique.",0,37

I don't have the emotional ups and downs that I used to. However, I have gained 34 pounds since starting this medicine. My doctor would like me to switch to Geodon, in hopes of losing the Abilify weight. I am scared to switch since I've done so well on the Abilify.

Also I am not sure but I have developed a swallowing problem which I never had and I know that if you have a swallowing problem before starting you should discuss with your doctor so I am just thinking that this has caused it.

First, I noticed rapid weight gain which surprised me, since I'm very active.  Also, it made me physically very tired but restless at the same time. Going jogging felt like torture, since my limbs felt so heavy. I tried to stop taking it but experienced extreme sleepiness which is usually a sign a depressive episode is coming on.  I think it's evened out my sleeping, but I wake up pretty early on it. I take it at night now.

I'd have bouts of rage and crying, but I'm not sure if that was the medicine itself causing agitation or if I was just upset because I was so restless. I also couldn't sleep more than 4 hours a night, and not at all during the day. The whole 2 weeks I was on it all I did was pace around crying and restless. These side effects definitely don't happen to everyone but they are possible, so you're aware.",1,2

After taking Abilify though, it seemed I was consciously aware of my own duality and that my emotions and thoughts are separate.  Now that I'm on Abilify I can switch between what I want.

Seroquel,"I can, now, see my own sign of mania or depression (having had Dialectical Behavioral therapy for six months). With that said, the meds are not miracles and after some dialectical treatment to add to my  tool box ... seroquel really helps. When I am restless, racing thoughts and moody I feel well balance after about 48-72 hours after using  coping skills  plus adding seroquel to prevent lack of sleep which induces worsening of thoughts, moods, eating, etc. For me, its very helpful to have self-relaxation skills to level my reactions. I give this medication, after months of skill work, A++. My experience is not to say it is 100% fluent to all bipolar sufferers. Good thing DBT is not a medication so wont hurt to try it as a  tool .  The side-effects are mild.

After taking it, I would still be awake for a couple hours trying to sleep and still having racing thoughts. In the morning, I had the worst experiences trying to wake up. I wasnt trying to wake up early or anything, like 11 on my free days so I could sleep in, and even then I could barely open my eyes enough to turn off my alarm and would immediately fall back asleep.

Stopped taking immediately after. Please note that the mood stabilizing effect only kicks in at a minimum dosage of 100 mg. Anything under that is a sedative, like Benadryl on steroids with the added benefit of developing akinesia and metabolic syndrome. You WILL gain weight on this drug regardless of dosage.

Seroquel,"This drug absolutely did not work for me. Well the sleeping part worked.... I never slept so much in my life. Instead of waking up from 12 hours of sleep feeling well rested, I woke up angry and wanting to punch someone in the face. Sure I can have anger outbursts but only while on Seroquel did I want to punch someone. Started low at 25mg and my doctor kept increasing my dosage to 100.mg At 100mg, I would sleep 18 hours straight and my days and nights were blurred. The anger caused me great urges to drink alcohol, which is ironic because I don't even like alcohol. Eventually just stopped cold turkey and to this day I have never woken up as miserable as I was on Seroquel. Also I gained 60 pounds in a little over 2 months and had severe impotence. So definitely not for me.",2,26
Seroquel,"Seroquel did not feel like it was doing anything for me the first month and a half in terms of my mood because it was the only med I was on. It did help me sleep again --  but I can't say it saved me from all of the racing thoughts and rapid cycling when up.  As someone with Bipolar Disorder who experiences severe depressive phases, two doses of Lithium Carbonate, Gabapentin as needed for anxiety, and Seroquel 150mg at night for sleep  is what is best for me.  I guess how it forces me to fall asleep and stay asleep is what in turn effects my mood to be more relaxed the next day. Who wouldn't be relaxed when they sleep 8-12 hours a night lol. Other than that effect I do not notice a big difference in my mood change like I do with other meds.",9,14
Seroquel,"Seroquel is an excellent choice for stabilizing the mood and improving sleep in the context of a Bipolar disorder.

So now at the edge of 60, I have horrible reactions  to psychotrophics. Seroquel paralyzed my arms and legs after my nightly 1 to 3 hours of sleep, such that I had to lay there until I could use my left arm to pick up my right arm, then with both free, I used them to get my legs going. I took it for about 4 years, with the above side effects plus the helicopters whizzing through my brain and body. To me, it is a nasty drug.  I finally got sick of it. tossed the remaining pills, went loopy. My partner thought I was going to die. I lived.",1,21
Seroquel,I have been on this medication for years. The only things that isnt  fun is the drowsiness and the increased appetite  but this medications side effects dont effect me nearly as much as other medications Ive taken,8,24
Seroquel,"I have bipolar mania with stages of depression. It has been like this since I was very young. It comes along with episodes of mood swings. I am on 25 mg of Seroquel now and have been on both 50mg and 100 mg. 25 mg does great things for me. No more sleepless nights. No more intense spending sprees. No more major anxiety most of the time. A lot less depression and a lot less irritability I experienced as well. I get tired and a little unmotivated in the morning, but I have coffee and breakfast and I'm good. Weight gain is the other concerns but I have controlled it with walking good amounts each day. Well worth a try and definitely something to consider for a bipolar patient.",8,50
Seroquel,"This medication has saved my life. I was having the worst episodes ever high low high low, no sleep, totally impulsive on the downward spiral to self destruction. Spending money running around town all hours, telling off people at work... then the crash. Sobbing in my doctor's office, she wrote the script for Seroquel. I had zero faith, because all the anti-depressants etc. she'd tried me on never worked to calm the chaos/PTSD reactivity in my head. I was ready to end it all. Thank goodness I filled the script and took it. I slept! That in itself is a miracle. I kept my job, and I'm hopefully on a journey to wellness. My mind is calmer. I can think one thing after another in a logical order instead of a cloud of white noise and traumatic memories flashing. I think with this med and some good PTSD therapy I might have a second chance... at life. I don't care if I gain a little weight... I want to live without constant chaos. So grateful.",8,56
Seroquel,Started at 25mg felt groggy in am but it passed after a week then increased to 50mg. My moods are stable but I don't feel drugged up. At least I'm sleeping well now. At this dose it still lets me express emotions. Doesn't interfere with my daily activities at all. Just  wish I'd taken it years ago.,10,32
Seroquel,"Only reason I gave this medication  Seroquel 3 stars is because, if you have trouble sleeping this pill will knock you out!  Other than that it makes you extremely hungry causing weight gain, may feel sluggish and irritated in the morning, &amp; also I noticed vivid dreams and sometimes nightmares. Sidenote: I experience post nasal drip that suddenly got better overtime. Seroquel makes my allergies worsen causing extreme post nasal drip!",3,11
Seroquel,Once I get use to the dosage it doesnt kick in as fast and when ever I dream I always have dreams that are really scary me there are some days that I feel like it doesnt work at all and other days it works great,8,8
Seroquel,"This medicine is ruining my heart, been on it for ten years and now have heart problems and constant chest pain...wasn't informed there's a blackbox warning",1,36
Seroquel,"I tried this medication a few years ago and could never get the dose correct. It was either too much or not enough. I recently tried it again and only took it for a week before the doctor took me off. I was taking this medication for bipolar disorder and insomnia. 30 minutes to 1 hour after taking this medication I would have constant dry mouth and my legs would twitch, RLS. Constant tossing and turning because of my legs and having to drink water because of the dry mouth finally passing out hours later and feeling like rubbish the next day.",2,22
Seroquel,"Been on Seroquel for some time and it really helps in managing irritability and wanting to fight with people. I was on 200mg it stopped working so now I'm trying with 400mg which makes me feel kind of sedated, think I will try 300mg which doesn't make me sedated.",9,18
Seroquel,"I have struggled with depression and anxiety for about 14 years (I am 27). The past 2 years have been the hardest, I have been suicidal every day and I had lost all hope.  For about 10 months I have been on: lexapro for 3 months, then effexor for 3 months, and now pristiq for 4 months.  I have also had regular talk therapy with a psychologist.   About a month ago a psychiatrist prescribed seroquel 25mg as an add on to my pristiq.  The past 4 weeks have been the best I have felt in many years.  I feel much lighter (as in, the heaviness of depression has lifted), much more positive, I haven't been ruminating about the past.  Seroquel has truly made a world of difference.  I truly think its very possible I could have ended up a suicide eventually without it.  It's only been 4 weeks, but hopefully the effects continue.  It's worth a try if nothing else has worked.",10,47
Seroquel,"I was hospitalized 17 years ago  with a major manic mixed episode. It was worst thing on earth. Was given 200 milligrams of serequel and it calmed down the demons. Tapered the dose down in months time come and stayed successfully at 50 milligrams for following 17 years. Long term side effects began with bloods changed, elevated blood sugar and triglycerides. Weaned and got off it, took several weeks. Feeling better with more clarity and regular movements now. Those two weeks of getting out of my system caused side effects of weird dreams, body aches and mood swings. Hard time sleeping. Increases over the counter supplements and made sure my life was low key until things settled. Im grateful for the med. If not for the side effects which would have led to diabetes I would have remained in it. But I believe in the beginning it saved my life.",7,30
Seroquel,"Female, 22 years old. I was given seroquel for what was thought to be psychotic depression. I was given 50 mg to take at night. The first night I took the med, it absolutely knocked me out BUT before I actually fell asleep, I felt super anxious, had shock like sensations through my body. It made me actually want to fight the medication because I did not like the way it made me feel. So the next night I went down to 25 mg, side effects werent as bad but I still felt very anxious then the next morning when I woke up, I noticed I felt super angry like my first thought as soon as I opened my eyes I just felt like so angry and Im not usually an angry person. I also drooled on myself so bad that my shirt was soaked the next morning. I didnt feel well rested, I tossed &amp; turned &amp; remembered doing things in the middle of the night that I knew werent dreams (all of these happened both nights I took the seroquel regardless of reducing the dose).",2,19
Seroquel,"I have been taking seroquel for over 10 years.  By far the best stabilizer for me.  Previously I had tried several meds.  At first my dosage was low, but kept climbing.  Dosage went to 800 mgs.  I changed my psych doc and she slowly walked me down to 400 mgs.  We even went down to 200 mgs. But that was too low.  I'm now at a happy medium.  I do take lithium as well and zoloft.  I have been diagnosed bipolar for 25 yrs, so you can imagine the med changes in the past.",9,21
Seroquel,Seroquel has made my life a really bad and made me gain 100 lbs,1,23
Seroquel,"I suddenly became manic and would have been hospitalized if it weren't for this drug.  They started me at a baby dose but with my emotions on fire they quickly upped the dose to 100mg.   I'm 58 years old and following this crisis I was diagnosed with Bipolar II.  I'm still agitated and angry during the day an having terrifying dreams due to PTSD.  Everything that was buried inside me is now coming to the surface through therapy.  They just raised the Seroquel to 300mg.  Hopefully I'll be able to sleep. I've lost 5 lbs, when I gave up Trazodone and they put me on Abilify, my appetite was cut in half.  I also take Lamotrigine 200mg and Elavil 20mg for migraines and fibromyalgia. To me, Seroquel is a wonder drug. Good luck!",8,23
Seroquel,"I took seroquel in a lower dose in the morning for agitation and anger management along with my mood stabilizer for bipolar and a larger dose at night to put me to sleep for years and it was very affective. However, I had suicidal thoughts that might have been worsened by it. If you're a parent or caretaker and your child has a history of suicidal tendencies please keep this medication (and all medication) locked up or in a place your child doesn't have access to.",6,11
Seroquel,"I was put on Seroquel 4 months ago as before I was on it I had really bad, uncontrollable mood swings throughout the day. After about 3 months of really struggling I had a really bad depressive episode where I was convinced people at work were out to get me. My mind was racing extremely fast, I had a huge amount of anxiety, and was extremely stressed out combined with really low sinking depression. I had to spend 24 hours in a hospital and they put me on Seroquel and a few other medications. The Serooquel  has completely saved my life, along with my support system. I had low sinking moods occasionally for about 2  months and had my dosage upped. Now I'm at 200mg every night and am about 90% stable. I was diagnosed Major Depression W/ Psychotic Features but since have been diagnosed with Bipolar II. If you're having mood swings or intense anxiety with an out of control racing mind please don't force yourself to push through it. Try seroquel and it might give you your life back like it did me.",9,65
Seroquel,Have been on many meds that were inappropriately used for my anxiety and instability including high dose Depakote and tryclic anti depressants making me more unstable with unbearable antipsychotic overloads. Eventually a sedative dose of seroquel around 125-150 mg worked very well for calming down anxiety intrusive thoughts and allowing me to sleep. It is ridiculous that some of the doctors who aggressively medicate and aren't cautious because the right dose of helpful medication can be life saving while a bad approach can cause instability that caused serious problems in my life. Then unfortunately psychiatrist often blame your condition over their inappropriate treatment so it's important to be aware of what's going on with you.,0,31
Seroquel,Seroquel has been life saving for me after being on the wrong medications that  it made more unstable so I ended up being  in hospitals for years.  Now at 125-150 mg of seroquel Im able to get rest and have reduced agitation and anxiety and am finally stable. I have also been put on higher doses which felt uncomfortable but the right dose has been life saving.,10,23
Seroquel,Due to weight gain I tried other medications to help control manic thoughts at night and help me sleep. Nothing works. What I decided to do was actually up my dose with my doctor so that the effects of sleepiness would kick in before the hunger. I take 200mg Seroquel at night with a combination of 300 mg  Wellbutrin XR for depression and 150 mg Lamictal for mood stabilizing during the day. I take 15 mg of BuSpar twice a day for anxiety. I got off all of these when I was pregnant and was complete basket case. This drug cocktail worked for 10 years and I spiralled when I went off of it. Since Ive been back on my meds four months Im completely normal again; functioning at a high-level. I run a very successful business and I know that I could not do it without these medications. I have virtually no side effects except for if I stay awake for too long after taking the Seroquel I will get on uncontrollable hunger. Seroquel does cause dry mouth in the middle of the night but its worth it,8,33
Seroquel,"Warning: may trigger suicidal thoughts.  History: I was prescribed Seroquel after multiple meds werent helping to improve my depression. Quickly, my depression got markedly worse to the point of me not being able to get out of bed and not bathing because they felt too exhausting. I also had my suicidal ideation and thoughts get overwhelmingly worse. My psychiatrist increased my dosage and it just got worse. I had to change psychiatrists (unrelated to this) and my new psychiatrist immediately had me taper down my dosage with the goal of getting off the Seroquel completely. Once I got off of it completely, I felt like a new person - no depression or suicidal thoughts since. I know this med has helped a lot of people and I am so happy it has. I dont think many other people have had this experience, but wanted to put it out there that it wasnt good for me and if anyone is having similar experiences, please speak with the person who prescribed it and know that it can get better.",1,32
Seroquel,"Seroquel has been a life-changer for me. It has curtailed my manic episodes and kept me sane as I struggle with bipolar I with paranoid features. I recently attempted to switch to Geodon due to weight gain, but I immediately switched back to Seroquel because the benefits outweigh the risks of some mild weight gain. I take 400mg daily: 200 mg in the morning and 200 mg in the evening. It helps me get a decent nights sleep which is crucial for keeping me from slipping into bipolar episodes. I give it a 9/10 because the weight gain can be a moderate annoyance.",9,24
Seroquel,"Ive had many problems with the wrong medications making me more unstable including restlessness. My seroquel dose was raised very quickly to 250mg in hospital, then overmedicated after. But now after working with a doctor for a long time my doses are between 75-125mg and have been life saving to calm me down and help me sleep and think clear after having very bad insomnia caused by anxiety. Ignorant doctors call this a sleep dose but it has many mood stabilizing benefits for people sensitive to medications. I also take with lamictal in morning and Gabapentin at night Klonopin as needed has been life saving.",10,22
Seroquel,"Good drug, pity that for my anxiety was not sufficient",6,7
Seroquel,Ive been on Seroquel for years-150mg at night to sleep. I combine it with 50 mg Trazodone and 0.5mg of Klonopin. I sleep through the night and I can deal with my anxiety and Bipolar 1. Diagnosed 22 years ago and tried just about every other drug suggested. This works-I get 8-9 hours of sleep a night. Im a bit groggy in the morning but Its worth it to be stable and functional,10,29
Seroquel,"I struggled with bipolar 1 disorder and before I found this medication I was all over the place. When I was manic I was like supergirl and when I was down I felt so pathetic and worthless. When I first got on this drug my ups and downs got better but they were still problematic. But, its almost been a whole year since I got on it and I have never felt more stable so Id say it takes time but its worth it. Im not at creative as I was when I didn't have any treatment, but I am still passionate (and sane lol) and that honestly makes up for it. And I definitely do not get that low. I have my fair share of struggles but Ive learned that its ok, its life, but nothing like the highs and lows I experienced before.  Its a miracle pill for me.",9,26
Seroquel,"I have been on Seroquel XR for 2.5 years now with doses ranging from 150mg to 250mg. Currently taking 200mg. It does work, BUT it works very slowly, therapeutically talking. The anti anxiety effects kick in I would in a week or two maximum and the sleepiness is very intense in the beginning. What I dont like about it, is that you get used to the dose very quickly and the symptoms return needing to either up or lower the dose. Its not a super stable medicine. The first days of upping the dose you do feel more stable, calmer, peaceful but a week after you find yourself asking for more. Now therapeutically, it brings you back to earth, you know, but its not enough. In my case the lack of motivation is a big thing for me. It was so bad my doctor thought I had attention issues and wanted me to try Adderall and I said no because I knew it was from seroquel. Anyway, all antipsychotics are motivation killers and make existing depression worse and trigger ADHD in my case. Good luck.",8,25
Seroquel,"Ive been on seriquel 400mgs for a lot of years, ( it was a lot higher dose.  I am bipolar type 2,  diagnosed in 2010, and if I take anymore I cannot get good sleep. I am amazed to read the comments\post how people are sleeping so well and are groggy on a 100-200mg tablet! Wish I could!!  Lol.  I'm on a 400mg dose and I can't sleep well at all? Should my dose be increased? Or should another medication be added? I fall asleep but  I'm not sleeping a load of hours, I get like 5-6 hours sleep no matter what time I take the dose.",0,18
Seroquel,"I have been on Seroquel for a little over 5 years, and currently at 100mg (was higher but I could not function). I am Bipolar I and have been since 1984. It was offered to me for my depressive side, and I can tell you for a fact, it didn't help at all for the mania (except it did and does help with sleep). After suffering through severe depression for about 2 years, Seroquel was introduced to me at the hospital. I went through some terrible side effect(s) that included legs with uncontrollable twitching and with arms. I still have twitches with my left arm but not often. The other effect is with the libido. I have no desire for this anymore. Is the drug worth it? I certainly is for me; without this, I am a goner to the mania world.",0,18
Seroquel,All the antidepressants were no good. Seroquel is the only med found to stabilize my mood.,10,21
Seroquel,Gave me extremely painful full-body muscle cramps. The muscles in my eyes even cramped up.,1,14
Seroquel,"This drug works for me, it's a great drug, I'll give it a 10 out of 10.",0,16
Seroquel,"I use this drug in a low dose, 25 mg, to help me sleep.  I am diagnosed BP1.  It makes me tired enough to get to sleep.  I do not feel extremely tired, but if I lie down and close my eyes I fall asleep quickly, and usually can stay asleep for 7 or more hours.   Some days, I do feel very groggy but it is worth it to me.  I drink very little alcohol - one beer every two weeks or so, but if I drink the beer close to bedtime the combination makes me extremely tired.   I have gained 15 pounds since my last Bipolar  major episode (Severe M followed by severe D in fall 17 to winter 2018).  All the gain happened on olanzapine (discontinued) but either lithium or seroquel seems to have made it tough to take some of that weight off.",8,10
Seroquel,"It changed my life. I am bipolar, and have far less episodes. I cant remember the last time I had one. Not only that, but it has substantially helped my insomnia in combination with other medications.",0,16
Seroquel,"Diagnosed bipolar II early 2017, age 29. A combination of 100mgs of lamotrigine + 20mgs Lexapro worked better to stabilise my moods/reduce my anxiety than anything ever had before, I was happy. Partner and I decided I was in a good place to start planning for a baby however my psych warned of the possible risks of conceiving on lamotrigine so I began a 12 mth period of transitioning to Seroquel, which is considered lower risk during pregnancy that lamotrigine.  Transitioning between drugs was going to be destabilising - I was prepared for that. What I wasnt prepared for, was getting to a point where I should have  stabilised  on my 200mgs of Seroquel, and to be more depressed, more tired, more overweight, less motivated, more aggressive/irritable, than I had been in a very long time. I gained 10kgs in a year, my appetite was HUGE, and I could barely function due to heavy sedation.  Back on lamotrigine now and feeling much more like my happy self again.",3,10
Seroquel,"I've been on seroquel 100mg for about a month. My psychiatrist said I had some of bi-polar 2 and signs of depression. I couldn't get out of bed and I had suicidal thoughts.  I began on 50mg the first two days then bumped up my dosage to 100mg. The first couple of days were pretty scary.. the side affects kicked in a bit. I had an anxiety attack while driving and had to get off my car (has never happened before.) One night I woke up in the middle of the night..couldn't breath felt like like I was about to vomit and pass out. About a week later, I began to feel better. Normal! Except for struggling to wake up in the morning. I am on my last week of the month and I'm starting to feel depressed again.. I jump in my sleep and get startled quickly. I have vivid dreams and sometimes I don't know if It happened in real life or not. Don't know why.. not sure if I need to change medication or dosage?",7,17
Seroquel,"I'm 18 and was diagnosed with Bipolar type 1 about a year ago. I've been using 200MG of Seroquel for a couple of months now and it's really helped my mood. I was suffering from a bad manic episode and it calmed me down within 1-2 weeks or so. The only bad side effect is increased appetite, sleeping a lot and nausea but I got over those within a couple of weeks.",8,11
Seroquel,I love it for sleep. Honestly I was on ambien and I took way too many and it wasn't safe. I honestly thought nothing could work like it but seroquel was a life saver. I sleep like a rock. It does make me hungry though,10,15
Seroquel,"I loved that this helped me sleep. Put me to sleep and kept me under. It gave me a baseline between my ups and my lows that I never really had experienced before. I unfortunately was having a reaction to it, every night my entire body would buzz/shake. I'd wake up to that horrendous feeling and fall back under. Beside the reaction I really loved it. Too bad my body reacted like that.",10,14
Seroquel,"Seroquel and I have a love hate relationship. When I first started taking it, I was in a hospital, my psychiatrist prescribed it. I had super vivid dreams.. but he insisted I stay on it and theyd go away. He was right, they did. Seroquel works great to calm your mind when you start receiving the correct dosage. However Im sleepy all the time! Its definitely a drug that I dont want to be on very long. Ive gained about 20lbs since being put on it, 7 months ago.",5,9
Seroquel,"Of all the meds Ive taken for my bipolar Seroquel is the best with the least side effects. Ive been on Abilify, Depacote, and another one cant remember the name. Horrible side effects...severe blurred vision, rash, panic attacks, restless legs, insomnia, gastritis, blood in stools and more. Seroquel is working for me and for that Im very grateful.",8,13
Seroquel,Literally garbage. Did not help moods. Slept 12 hours at night and still needed 2-6+ hours of naps in day. No control over when to sleep. Lots of weight gain.,1,10
Seroquel,"The Cons: higher appetite, weight gain, diabetes, cognitive dulling. The Pros: I take 800/day all at night and once a quarter I accidentally double dose and feel perfect after that.  I just slept for 24 hrs during a stay-cation and wow do I feel good and sharp.  So my employer is aware of my condition and we structure my workload, such that I do serious creative computer programming in the afternoon after the dulling wears off.  My advice is to take it all at 8pm and get in bed at 8:30 - 9:00.  Then you will be able to do normal work at 9am and complex work after noon.  Diet and exercise are key, because you have to manage the diabetes that comes with it.  If I feel depressed or manic, I might add 400mg and that usually fixes it, but that is probably risky.  Also note that the generic is really cheap now, under $25/month at max legal dose.  Or $54 for 3 months worth.",8,10
Seroquel,"It slowed my mind down so I could sleep. My Dr - psychologist and psychiatrist worked together with me to find the right does. 150 mg is perfect. I had been sleep deprived for years, and was told to sleep no less than 12 hours for 2 straight months. I would take 50 mg for a few days then 100mg a few days later I was up to my full dosage. After adding an extra pill, the first mornings were a little rough, holding on to the walls and walking slowly for the first 5 or so minutes of waking.  This has made my life so much better in combination neither Clozanepam. I dont have anxiety or panic attacks. My psychologist isnt urging me and making arrangements for me to check into a hospital to get rest. These 2 drugs have changed my life and Ive monitored my weight,",9,7
Seroquel,"I give Seroquel 7 out of 10. It works like a charm for my crazy head, but that doesn't seem to change the fact that it has  sedative side effects",7,7
Seroquel,I take 800mgs of Seroquel and 1 mg Zolipderm. I have bipolar 1 and PTSD With this combination of pills I sleep all night with no side effects. I take Lorazepam 1mg twice a day as needed and take Adderral 20mgs 3 times a day for my ADHD. I was having fainting spells. I was so sick I had to be admitted to the hospital. Stayed two days back to normal.,10,3
Seroquel,"I am a teenager and I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder. At first everyone thought it was just depression so I was put on prozac. Prozac made me worse. It increased my anger, but that was just because I didn't have depression. I switched psychiatrists and found out I was bipolar. I was put on a low dose of Seroquel (50mg) and within 3 weeks I was on 200mg. Seroquel works extremely well to mellow out my moods and keep me from being depressed or manic. Only side effect I'm experiencing is weight gain but that is not a bad thing as I have been underweight for a long time.",10,19
Seroquel,Seroquel is a total hell. It gives you the impression that your brain is burnt by it in a very conscious way. All your person seems possessed by it... It's like a chemical weapon... It's a so unpleased sensation that I now react so badly when a professional is talking to me about it. I've so much suffered by this. How a so small pill can do so much harm? The sensation can't even be described. It literally just erased my mind when I take it at times.  Don't try this!,0,20
Seroquel,"I used this medication at the peak of my mania induced paranoid psychotic episode and it helped calm it immediately. However, I am extremely sensitive to medication, so while taking only 25mg of this I became so tired that I couldn't possibly stay awake. Even though I took it at night, it became dangerous because I could no longer walk or talk properly, I even considered peeing in the bed because I couldn't even walk to the bathroom..lol. Although it completely knocked me out for 8+ hours and I had a fantastic sleep, when I woke up I was still tired.. which eventually made me depressed. I ended up stopping this medication because I couldn't get the dose up to where it needed to be to control my bipolar symptoms (any higher than 25mg and I'd start drooling). I guess I'm just very sensitive.",4,15
Seroquel,Amazing. This stops my body from producing too much energy. and makes me sleepy. Alot of people don't know schizophrenia is just extreme mania. when your brain produces too much dopamine &amp; you can't sleep. This medication saved my life :) I recommend taking it with prozac &amp; lamictal.,10,8
Seroquel,"3 years ago I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt &amp; diagnosed with rapid-cycling bipolar. I was put on a low dose of seroquel until I could get in to see the psychiatrist a month later. It definitely levelled out my mood and made me feel much more stable within days. Even after switching meds 3 times since, I still use seroquel as a supplementary medication and I have no desire to get off of it",9,9
Seroquel,"I was put on this med years ago and taken off. I asked him why I stopped taking it because of weight gain, I don't feel that was the only reason. I have had problems with anxiety and depression for a long time, but it got extremely worse. The anxiety was so bad that I couldn't eat, gave me worse flashbacks from my PTSD which was caused by trauma throughout my life (domestic abuse and rape). I got headaches, eye pain, palpitations, my hypothyroidism was all off, stomachs pain, worse depression to the point I lost weight which I am already thin. I could go on, but the Dr didn't take into consideration that I suffer from epilepsy, got vertigo, seizures increased. I ended up yesterday in a crisis center because I couldn't stop crying, and had racing thoughts which I forgot to mention. And the flashbacks of my life was one after another. Just was not a good choice of medication for me, especially with physical issues.",1,13
Seroquel,"I was prescribed Seroquel for treatment resistant depression. I only took it for about 2 weeks. For every night I wasn't able to sleep my doc upped my dose. Which was most nights. In my opinion, it was upped too quickly. It literally made me feel like I was going crazy. I'm aware that is a very subjective feeling, but I can't put it in words how bad it made me feel. I would still recommend it only if titrated very slowly.",2,9
Seroquel,"works well. It  knocked me out, sleep great through the night.. was having a hard time sleeping with other insomniac medications, &amp; by far this is the best so far. I only started taking it so I'm not sure, what the side effects will be.( I'm taking it for bi polar)",9,5
Seroquel,This has helped me immensely in combo with lexapro to treat anxiety and depression,0,9
Seroquel,"I'm surprised to see so many positive reviews for seroquel for depression and panic/anxiety. That is why I was prescribed it 2x a day and I didn't take it very long. Everyone is different, I'm glad it works for others, for me I was extremely tired 24/7, had to force myself to get up and stay up and do anything, I felt like I was out of it like it wasn't even to help me mentally and emotionally but like I took a street drug. I was so tired and forcing myself to stay up. I couldn't do anything luckily I didn't have a job at the time. This drug did not help me. Everyones different though, I'm sure it has helped others. To me its like seroquel=sleep.",1,14
Seroquel,"the reason I'm rating this drug 10/10 is that it does not stab you in the back , and it does not ask for increased doses , it works all the time , and kicks in fast , and makes you feel euphoric combined with sleepiness. If stayed awake more than 30 minutes after taking it , you will feel hungry , so if you are worried about gaining weight just take it and sleep.  Find your correct dose that works well , and remember good sleep equals good mood. If you feel sleepy the next day , thats if ' drink some coffee + 1 cup of water.  And remember to do 20 minutes of exercise every day just not before going to sleep and you will feel batter 100%",10,40
Seroquel,"This drug has changed my life. I'm on 300 mg and find it helps me sleep and stops me from becoming stupidly manic. I haven't gained any weight but I go to the gym and walk every day, so I'm very active. My only complaint is it takes me quite a while to wake up in the mornings. I'm also on 300 mg of Lamictal.",9,10
Seroquel,It does help with sleeping and my brain was so calm BUT I was only on 25 mg and I gained 15 pounds in 3 months. I was constantly hungry but even if I only ate salad it would just keep me at the same weight. It was the gross cellulite chunky fat! My metabolism and thyroid was changed. I went off Seroquel to stop my body from changing so much.,3,11
Seroquel,"I was on numerous different bipolar medications but this one was the worst! This medicine landed me in the hospital. I had pain in right waist when I urinated. My creatinine levels were high. And picked up a LOT of weight. I wonder if some of these reviews weren't written by the company itself. It seems there are lots more people struggling with these meds. I weaned off it but now it seems I have bad withdrawals, blood pressure problems, headaches, fainting, dizziness, severe insomnia, heart palpitations, red spots on my skin, my insides feels like they are shaky! I would never ever recommend this",2,23
Seroquel,"Seroquel saved my life. With it, I can sleep deeply, I can restrain myself from impulsive behavior, it calms my anxiety, and it stops my irritability. I am a rapid cycle bipolar 2. I've noticed I have a 3 day gap of not taking it before my mania comes back. The only side effects that I've experienced is sweating/dry mouth (so stay hydrated) and seroquel munchies. Right before bed as it hits me I get the munchies. If I eat right before I take it, I don't have such an intense craving for food. Rate 8/10.",8,20
Seroquel,This stuff is terrible! I have been on it for a very long time and had a lot of side effects like weight gain but the worst one was the dry mouth. I would drink 4 bottles of water every night and eat hard candy and spend most of my time in the bathroom.  I also wanted to eat everything in sight. My doctor finally took me off this stuff and I'm on another drug like it but without all the side effects. I'm also feeling a lot better mentally.,1,16
Seroquel,"I usually don't post on these sites but I had to with seroquel. First off, if you are on this drug, you have to give up drugs and alcohol. It does suck but I still party and go out and have fun with my friends, just sober fun. But learning how to dance your butt off without the help of alcohol is actually pretty liberating.  I just want everyone to know that without going completely sober on this drug you get 1/2 the benefits of it. I drank half a drink the other night and was fatigued for 1 and a half days and was late for work. Imagine if I had two drinks every night I went out! I would be sleeping all the time!  For everyone with Bi Polar, we know that taking care of ourselves and sleep is very important. We got this guys&lt;3",9,22
Seroquel,"OKAY SO, I was put on this medication to help manage my bipolar disorder. This medication would either COMPLETELY knock me out, or I would be able to fight it and stay awake throughout the night snacking ALL NIGHT long. it made me so hungry, and I gained 40lbs on it. My doctor NOW wants to put me on Ziprasidone which is similar to this medication, and I am very hesitant.",5,6
Seroquel,"Made my mood a thousand times worse, only helps with putting me to sleep",4,5
Seroquel,"Very effective. I feel human again. Sometimes you don't realize how far gone you are until you're better. No side effects other than weight gain which can be managed with a proper diet. I feel 100%. I'm also on Lithium, buspar, lexapro, and the Seroquel is 200mg. Seroquel really feels like it made the difference or topped it off.",10,7
Seroquel,"I have Bipolar 2 , depression, anxiety  and so started taking seroquel in 2005. It has helped my racing thoughts, some of my nightmares, and fears, and it has helped me sleep. I gained a lot of weight on it. It has helped me to get better with my mental health issues. I think it's helped me have a better life. I'm grateful to all the people who made seroquel a medicine that's approved for people to use . Because it helps me feel a lot better. I take also citalopram for depressions. And Ativan for anxiety. I also take depakote.",0,9
Seroquel,I have been on 11 meds in 5 years.  MDD re diagnosed as Biplar1 three years ago.  Seroquel works for me.  Started on 25 mg q.d. But after psychotic break out am up to 400mg.  Plus 900mg Lithium.  I think were getting close to right cocktail including Adderall and atavin when required.  No weight gain but have had eating binges.  Makes me sleepy but Im ok by 10:00 am with sheer guts and. Coffee.  I am thankful for these medicines.,9,7
Seroquel,"I had side effects beginning Seroquel which subsided after 6 weeks, I grew to appreciate this drug it did wonders for my racing thoughts, plus sleep. BUT now need to come off it after many years omg- even tapering its horrible, I'm off it now and Im suffering withdrawals. So extreme lethargic, depressed, fluey, had 2 weeks of random vomiting plus still had  nausea and can hardly look at food. I used to call Seroquel my friend and smile but now my light headed ness is back. I wish I had energy and could eat well. 2 weeks this could last or more. Just putting this out there, I was a fan and still am I guess of this drug, but coming off is hard. I hardly ever get side effects and have gone off quickly with some, but this - this is hard, this is",8,12
Seroquel,"I was in and out of the psych ward for psychosis (diagnosed bipolar I with mania induced psychosis) for years until I finally committed to taking my meds and was put on seroquel 200 and lithium 900 nightly. I slowly weaned down the seroquel and have been at 25 mg for the past year in addition to the lithium. I have had zero episodes and have had a cool, stable mood since then. Seroquel works great for insomnia and the regular sleep has helped keep my mania non-existent. On a low dose the weight gain is manageable with proper diet and exercise and there are little to no side effects (besides the serious munchies.)",9,13
Seroquel,"Six months without a bipolar cycle.  I want to socialize again, date, have friends around, and I'm always in a decent mood.  Amazing medicine.  I take 300 mg of quetiapine with 1200 mg lithium and 200 mg lamictal.  My cocktail works!",10,18
Seroquel,I try to avoid going on these forums because they always give me anxiety about the new medication I am trying out. I have let this forum make me think that side affects were happening to me that really weren't in the past.  Seroquel is amazing. I have Bi Polar and Seroquel was not out when I was first diagnosed. I started on it May of 2016 and I have had to increase my dose 100mg since then and it has changed my life. Seroquel has given me the ability to start to live my life more the way I want to live it. I wanted to  post that here to not discourage someone who is starting out on it.  My psychiatrist heard about this from one of the top Bi Polar doctors in the world speak at Harvard. This drug is wonderful and so helpful.,10,27
Seroquel,Seroquel was prescribed for sleep disorder and it works just fine without any hangover the next morning,8,16
Seroquel,"I have mainly been given this medication for insomnia, and for several years it worked incredibly to help me sleep every night, the withdrawals are rough when I don't have it, and my insomnia get's really bad as well. I think it helped my anxiety depression some too. All of a sudden at 200mg it stopped working! Was very bummed out, but luckily doctor has found a replacement.",10,16
Seroquel,"I first took Seroquel about five years ago. I liked it because it didn't have the same side effects, such as feeling extremely anxious, as other anti psychotic medications have.  The problem that I had with it was that it gave me a huge appetite.  The medication alone caused me to gain weight.  Needless to say I no longer take it.",6,13
Seroquel,Hello! I have bipolar 1 with psychotic features and I have been taking seroquel instant release for almost four years. Currently I take 300 mg in the morning and 600 mg at night. Seroquel has helped my depression like other but at the same time has kept my mania and psychotic episodes at bay. Don't know where I would be without this drug!,10,22
Seroquel,"At one point, I was on regular seroquel as needed and seroquel XR daily. During this time, I gained a lot of weight that I just could not take off. I was prescribed the seroquel as needed, 25 mgs up to 3 times a day.  Later on, I was going through something else and seroquel had just gone generic. My psychiatrist put me back on the 25 mg pill as needed. I rarely used it and this time I didn't gain any weight from it, which I was relieved about. I know they say that the lower doses are supposed to make you really tired, but that didn't seem to have any effect on me.",8,8
Seroquel,Ambfly made me gain 100lbs in 8mos. I got off of it and started to loose 5lbs a night. My bad episodes got worse. I wish. I had the right information about this drug. If had known about the drug beforehand I would never have taken it,1,18
Seroquel,"So vivid in detail, from some,  but, give this medication time. This drug had me feeling some wacked out, like on a boat sensation. Just light headed and motion sickness. I was told six weeks so instead of stopping it, which I dearly wanted to - I didn't. And to this day approx four years I thank myself, I didn't.. yes its heavy handed. But now I have nearly no racing thoughts, which drove me to suicidal tendancies, my mind never stopped it was like a TV on in the back ground. Next, sleep, sleep, peaceful sleep,  I did crave sugar BUT NO WEIGHT GAIN. This drug is just broadly so good. This drug and a couple others balanced me.  The racing thoughts Seroquel number one, but Ritalin was also something I am grateful for.",10,37
Seroquel,"Only lasted 2 weeks at the lowest dose, stopped because the side effects were so intolerable.  Took in the evening, but still had trouble staying awake during the day, and felt like a total zombie when I did.  May have given this a couple more weeks to see if it would have worn off had I not gained 15 lbs. as well (with no appetite change - I wasn't awake long enough to eat more!). I was already 35lbs overweight from meds as it was, &amp; when I med chunks me up, it doesn't stop.   Only reason it gets 2 stars is that it kicked my chronic insomnia's butt.",1,19
Seroquel,"For years I struggled with finding the right medication to help treat my bipolar disorder.  Olanzapine basically turned me into Sleeping Beauty. I take 200mg of Seroquel, three times a day.  Keeps me nice and level",9,16
Seroquel,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 5 years ago. I was so stressed about work, even though I liked my job and wasn't stressed about it for years before. Had continuous trouble sleeping more than 4 hours a night sometimes less. I went off work for two months due to stress, anxiety and depression. My doctor prescribed 25 mg of seroquel and 20 mg of cipralex for depression. I take both at night an hour before going to bed. I saw a psychiatrist for about two months during the time I was off work. I didn't get off the couch basically all day for about a month. Started to sleep better and feel a bit better after a few weeks. I sleep perfectly now and haven't had any real problems last five years.",10,24
Seroquel,"Very drowsy for the first week of taking it, but once your body gets used to it, it is a great mood stabilizer. I've been on it 6 years and it calms the edginess and irritability with bipolar. Also makes you sleep like a rock. My weight only changed when lithium was added to my meds. No significant weight gain for me. If I go a few days without it, I notice I'm on edge constantly.",8,37
Seroquel,I took this medication on top of my regular antidepressants to help with my mood as well as insomnia. This was the worst medication I could have possibly used. I have a history of anorexia and binge eating disorder and Seroquel caused me to gain 10 pounds in a month which sent me into a total depressive episode.,1,16
Seroquel,I was having extreme depression and hypomania and they could not find the correct drug for me and this was the miracle drug for me it was the key. It works very well for me and I would recommend it. I take Seroquel at night because it does make me a little sleepy.,10,31
Seroquel,"Been suffering with moderate/major depression with periods of extreme anxiety and daily thoughts of specific suicidal thoughts for 7 months. Suffered really rough initial side effects with Lexapro and endured this medication for 4 months up to 30mg. Felt worse then ever at this dosage and so I sought help from a private practice. He immediately told me to lower my dosage to 20mg of Lexapro (to eventally taper off completely) and put me on 300mg Seroquel, 200mg night and 100mg mornings. The day after, I woke up with new hope and a sense of calmness. I no longer felt suicidal. Thus the conclusion is that I'm probably Bipolar Type 2, meaning antidepressants is not the right for me. Seroquel always makes me sleep every night, all night! :)",9,26
Seroquel,"I was recently diagnosed with type 2 BP in July of 2016. I was on Lamictal at first and it was a nightmare, It kept me from being sad but I would still get very angry. Seroquel was next and I was too scared to take it at first, but once I started having a LOT of heated arguments and stress I finally decided to take it. So far so good, I only take 25mg because is chills me out and eases my anxiety. I don't get sad and I don't get overly mad or excited. First few days I am tired on the meds but after a few days I am able to manage my life. I wish I would have went to a Dr years ago to get treated because since I was 13 my moods have been up and down. Now I'm as chill as a cucumber.",8,37
Seroquel,My Dr told me basically nothing else has worked so what do u want him to do. The seroquel seemed to at first but I gained weight quickly and people are always asking if I'm expecting because I look maybe 5 months pregnant. I have paranoia problems as well with anxiety. I have suicidal thoughts throughout the day but I don't share that with my Dr because I don't want to get put in a hospital so I keep that to myself. I'm extremely depressed and it doesn't help me sleep. I can't sleep because of the thoughts going crazy in my head. So I have to take ambien.  I'm sick of all these medications. I also take wellbutrin for depression and Xanax for anxiety. the Xanax helps but when I try to pull back from using it my body jerks. I know I need help,1,26
Seroquel,This drug saved my life.  I had my first manic episode recently and the doctor put me on 200mg and 50mg Xr at bedtime.  I take Vraylar too.  I sleep well and my bipolar tendencies (rage and mania) are pretty much cured. It took two months before I was not fatigued the next day. I have no weight issues from this drug. Thank God for this drug and the doctor who prescribed it.,9,26
Seroquel,"I was diagnosed with bipolar, PTSD and depression. I was put on lithium and seroquel about 5 months ago.  Lithium makes it so I don't feel .....anything. And seriously I take around 6pm and the next morning I feel like a zombie. Half the time I can't even get out of bed to go to work. All I want to do All day is sleep. I've told my doctor but he keeps telling me to give it some more time....... I have kids I have to take care of, but I feel so tired and lazy on seroquel. Only upside is it does help me sleep throughout then night instead of being awake depressing about my life. Lithium, not sure what it does to me but tries to block my emotional feelings which is good and bad at the same time. I still feel sadness though. Everyday.",4,18
Seroquel,"I've been on Seroquel more years then I know.I have always been on the magical 200mg. I'm only on 50mg now, because of weight gain. I really did not want to be on this, and tried to go off..The headaches, and misery are just awful trying to come off this drug. So, back on Seroquel... along with Lamictal, Tegretol and Topomax. I have Bipolar 1, another name I've been told is Classic Bipolar. Seroquel helps with sleep for sure. Don't like the heaviness on the chest, if it's too high a dose. Also, getting up to eat like 10 minutes after taking it. AND  feeling zombie next day. I've noticed if My meds aren't taken before midnight, forget the next day. Next day is gone..Sleeping all day. And If I don't snack with these meds,my heart feels weird.",0,33
Seroquel,"Where do I begin? Seroquel, personally I think it is a great medication for the right person. I've taken seroquel on and off 3 different times, I am currently back on it and will most likely stay on it. I take 800mg before bed time and sleep like a baby. I do have a few side effects from this medicine which include dry mouth, constipation and indigestion. I take seroquel for Borderline personality disorder (BPD), I am also on 300mg lithium and 300mg 3x a day of gabapentin. Seroquel helps control my mania and impulsive behavior, it does not make me a zombie and I have great concentration. What I don't understand is this drug being prescribed to people for sleep issues, sure you sleep like a baby but those are the people with all these terrible side effects and horror stories.",10,27
Seroquel,"My experience with this drug has been generally positive. It does tone down my hypomania, and is amazing at helping me sleep (it used to take me up to 3.5 hours lying in the dark to fall asleep...now it's closer to between 1-2 hours). However, it does give some weird side effects. It gives me intensely vivid dreams. I normally dream very little, but this gives me very strange dreams every night that I can very clearly remember on waking up. These dreams even frequently (3/4 times a week) cause me to wake up in the middle of the night! Would not recommend if you already have frequent nightmares or night terrors, as seroquel may make those much worse. Ineffective for depression.",7,33
Seroquel,"I've been on this for about 8 months so far. I take 300mg at bed time. It helps with sleep, but I do feel a bit tired during the day. This has really reduced my mania. I used to argue with people until I was literally foaming at the mouth, but now I lose interest in arguments within 5 or 10 minutes. Twitter and news used to upset me and I'd get ampted up about stories, but that's gone away mostly. Now I can react to things that used to make me furious with a laugh or just a short discussion with someone. Seroquel's not perfect, but the weirdness and intensity I used to experience has gone. It also helps greatly with my IBSd. I haven't had any weight gain, but my diet is low-fat and limited. Seroquel is MUCH better than TCAs btw. Good luck!",8,34
Seroquel,"Hi all! I'm diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar type 1. After my most recent manic episode I crashed into the worst depression and extreme anxiety I've ever experienced. I was tried on the usual antipsychotics and had dangerous side effects from all of them except Seroquel. For years and years I've had extreme insomnia. I was started on Seroquel (300mg) for sleep about 6 months and it was immediately effective. I love being able to sleep, but I'm sleeping 10  hours. I'd like to try to cut back a little and see if I can get to 8-9 hrs/night. My psychiatrist tells me I'm not just taking it for sleep, but for the bipolar itself. I'm still not back to my usual self due to lack of interest in anything. Hopefully I'll soon be better!",8,23
Seroquel,"Caused excessive weight gain (60+lbs) very quickly (despite me eating LESS), caused a weird decrease in cognitive ability, higher blood pressure (I already have hypertension, thanks), elevated blood sugar levels and probably other things I'm forgetting... I've been put on this against my will repeatedly because it's a Medicaid favored drug in my state, but it DOES NOT WORK FOR ME. I still have Medicaid but go to a private pay shrink because he listens.",1,23
Seroquel,"I have been on this medication for about a week now. I am a type 1 diabetic. My sugars are extremely on the high side. It was like overnight it raised my sugars terrible. It has the complete opposite affect, my mind races. I pace , no sleep for me. So I think I need to be done with this. The not taking it verses the side effects. And I don't need this. So diabetics beware.",1,18
Seroquel,"I was prescribed this drug  at crisis preparation and recovery services in Tempe, Arizona. I was misdiagnosed by her as bi polar . While on this medication, alongside with lexapro and klonopin - I gained weight fast and almost suffocated in my sleep. Be careful with this medication, and make sure you see a doctor before considering it - not a louzy nurse practitioner. Although I almost died from the drug, I know that the drug can be used well if the provider knows what they are doing. The NP was not listening to my concerns which should of been red flags,and she was not educated on the subject of medicine enough to prescribe/diagnose. She is now under investigation by the state board and may not be working anymore.",7,19
Seroquel,"A word of caution.  I've noticed how positive these reviews tend to be.  You should look-up the withdrawal effects when coming of this drug.  I've been on and off medication for the last 20 years. When I came of efexor 15 years ago I couldn't walk for three days.  But that was nothing compared to seroquel.  And it takes 90 days for the withdrawal effects to begin to wear off.  Seriously, before taking this drug you need to do some research.  I would STRONGLY advise you to find another drug.",3,50
Seroquel,"I've been taking this for a few weeks and I think I've already gained 10 pounds because I am hungry 100% of the time. I've had insomnia for all 20 years of my life and have yet to find a medication that makes me sleep till this one, and on the 50 mg dose. That would be amazing if it did not make me sleep for the rest of the day too. It shuts me down to the point where it is harder than normal to breathe. I've been staying with it in hopes that I would improve but all I've noticed is that I am more irritated by even the smallest things.",2,33
Seroquel,"Love love love this drug. It has normalized my sleep, though the initial morning grogginess was hard to deal with. However, this side effect went away after the first month or two. I'm at 300mg and it has normalized my moods and has mostly gotten rid of my anxiety. The only downside is that it causes some pretty extreme munchies, which does lead to some weight gain. May also have contributed to my pre-diabetic condition.",10,27
Seroquel,"I am into week 2 of taking Seroquel for Bipolar disorder.  The main side effects that I am noticing are the feeling about 20 minutes after taking it (makes me feel the same way Trazadone did when I took it for insomnia), and the cloudiness the next day.  I have had several situations where something will come up, and I'll recall a conversation or physical activity that I truly think happened, but I cannot determine if I dreamed it or if it really happened.  But, I am already noticing a major difference in the way I feel and am able to concentrate and interact while at work, and even with family (in a good way).  Since it's only been 2 weeks, of course I am going to give it a little more time.",7,25
Seroquel,"After being on this medication for several months, I finally reached a dosage (600mg) that helped. I needed this to calm down my manic state. This being said, I gained close to 20lbs. As a 18 year old girl, this affected my confidence greatly. I was on a vegan diet for 7 months prior to being on this medication, and stayed on the diet while taking it. My weight was stable around 125 for all those months, however upon starting I went up to 145. Not to mention how absolutely exhausted this medication made me. I highly suggest trying to find another medication.",4,28
Seroquel,"I felt more emotionally stable on this, meaning when I would have usually gotten to a certain point, the medication stopped it before it could escalate. For the first few months I was thankful for not completely crashing and burning every couple of weeks (I was in a particularly stressful situation in the period of time I was taking this so my hopelessness was exasperated), significant reduction in hallucinations and paranoid delusions, not being able to cry, sleeping consistently and having no memory of my dreams. The reasons as to why I stopped taking it were degenerated eyesight (my eyesight had been perfect prior to meds), severely effected long and short term memory and zero motivation in all areas of life. I didn't feel like myself.",6,32
Seroquel,Very horrible experience on this medication that I took years a go. Side effects were not pleasant.,2,14
Seroquel,"I am currently on 50mg of Seroquel in addition to other meds. It has certainly made a huge positive difference in my paranoid thinking and obsessive-compulsive spartanism. It has leveled out my wild swings between anxiety and depression somewhat. It works great on my insomnia too. It causes me constipation and aggravates my essential tremor, but its benefits are well worth the price. I have not yet experienced the increase in appetite it's known for.",9,27
Seroquel,"Seroquel XR definitely helped me with my moods and rapid cycling. But.... gave it away because I was forever hungry. I lost all internal compass on whether or not I required food. Which is scary for me because I've always been normal weight and relied upon internal hunger cues to direct my eating. These cues were lost on seroquel. I wanted to eat all the time! I put myself on a strict diet yet the weight still kept creeping on. In my opinion, seroquel lowers the metabolism. Such that you'd have to restrict your calorie intake quite seriously. I'm going to try Latuda instead as it's a weight neutral preparation.",6,21
Seroquel,It didn't work and made me gain 70+ pounds. Conning off was AWFUL!,1,24
Seroquel,"when I was first put on this medication in the emergency room, I was coming off heroin and my mood swings was horrific, and my anxiety was off the charts, they put me on 200 mg. immediately and was to take it 3 times a day. I was diagnosed as bipolar, ptsd severe anxiety disorder, hearing voices to kill myself, sleep disorder, among a few others. I have loved this medicine since day one almost 4 years ago. I have ended up 150 lbs. over weight, and diabetic. however one may see this, I call this my miracle pill. I wish I had been put on it as a teenager. I have told my psych don't ever try to take this away from me, I get paranoid at thinking about it. I may be fat and diabetic, but I have a good life and great family.",10,64
Seroquel,This medication was a life saver after being admitted in the hospital for being manic an very agaitated was titrated from 50mg to 250mg a day in it has cured my agitation 75% of my mood 50% of my deppression since most antidepressants make me manic I would recommend to anyone who has tried multiple medicines I can finally sleep feel relaxed in not stay angry for hours.,9,42
Seroquel,"I am a 42 yr. old woman with ADHD along with Bipolar Depression also coming off 8 yrs. of taking pain medications every day ( norco's as well as Percocet's) I was getting between both 300 a month.. I've been off the pain meds for 4 mth now so far so good.. But after the fog cleared from the pain meds all my other diagnoses come out full blast,. So I was taking a 2mg Xanax, 350mg soma, along with 300mg trazadone at night and still couldn't sleep. Thanks to my new doctor I'm on 1mg Xanax along with 100mg Seroquel at night and within a hour I'm asleep and I mean good sleep (no dreams getting up thru the night etc.,) so fingers crossed it stays that's way!!!",9,32
Seroquel,"I'm at the two-week point. And while it's still a bit painful to get out of bed, once I do I no longer feel stoned. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Days one through five were as follows: 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg.  Then it was a matter of getting my body acclimated to 400 mg, which I thought would never happen.  If you are able to take vacation/sick days/medical leave, I do suggest it. I did not. Either way, just know it does get better within a matter of weeks.",8,29
Seroquel,"Seroquel has been very helpful with sleep, and I also noticed some mood stabilization in combination with Lamictal and sometimes Klonopin.  Sometimes it is overly sedating, but taking it a couple of hours before normally going to sleep is important for me so that I don't feel drowsy the next day.  I did not notice any weight gain on it.  My doctor started me on 50 mg, which was good for sedation, but no major difference in mood.  100 mg does make a difference in lower my anxiety and some mood stabilization with my other medications, but sometimes she recommends me to take 200 mg to reduce mania from flaring up when it starts.  Overall, this med has been useful for Bipolar 1 for me.",8,39
Seroquel,"I have been on serequel for 3 years. It is a blessing. I went through my whole life sleep walking until my cousin was diagnosed bipolar. I took one of his pills becausehe ccomplained it made him sleep and finally with 300 mg. I am sleeping. He no longer takes it. I told my friend about it she is on it, but has a small dosage. I have a high tolerance to all drugs so it works for me. Just added lamotrine... Because I want to rise earlier in the morning. But if my sleep is ddisturbed I will stick with it. As iI can never go back to miserable ssickening insomnia. Pray for me.",0,17
Seroquel,"This was the worst I wouldn't give this to my dog. I was given this to treat Bipolar II when I was 22. It screwed with my sugar system, kept me near comatose and gave me tics that thankfully went away when I stopped taking it.  I would never take this again.",1,27
Seroquel,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II when I was 15 years old and have used only cannabis since then to deal with it, but after years of cannabis abuse my symptoms started to become uncontrollable, I needed to smoke 2-3 grams of weed a day just to stay physically calm, and even then I had a lot of internal anxiety and no motivation. I could never quit smoking because if I did I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, couldn't sit still, and couldn't feel any joy. I would always relapse if I quit. I started Seroquel a week ago, and haven't had any weed since: I can eat normally, sleep 6-7 hours a night, and feel relatively happy. Plus I have literally no side effects as far as I can tell. I haven't felt this good in years; It's all uphill from here!",9,60
Seroquel,"Pleased with this medication. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 two years ago at age 48. Started on lamotrigine (300 mg) and buproprion  XL (150 mg) taken in the morning, which worked well, but didn't calm the incessant negative and depressing thoughts I was still battling. Seroquel was added recently. I take 300 mg at bedtime. Great sleep medication! This is the best, most effective medicine I've ever used if I need to get to sleep early in order to wake up early in the morning for work. I exercise on my elliptical on average 5 days a week, and haven't experienced any weight gain since taking Seroquel, gratefully. I think weight gain would be less of an issue if more bipolar people committed to exercising on a regular basis.",9,35
Seroquel,Been on sroquel for one month. Have gained 9 lbs. otherwise good drug.,8,15
Seroquel,"I have started to take 200 mg in July 2015. I have gained weight to much , nearly 20 kg. I have taken 100 mg in December 2015 and now I have been taking 50 mg. I want to quit Seroquel. Because I feel like zombie . I sleep very well but I can't get up early and I often go to work too late. During the day I feel tired and asleep. For mind and brain is good but damages of Seroquel is more than benefits of it , I think. It does addiction . I want to quit it or I want to take 25 mg any more.",3,24
Seroquel,"Been in therapy with a Counselling Psychologist for just over 3 years. Diagnosis from Consultant Psychiatrist - Complex-PTSD, Bipolar Type 2 and Fibromyalgia.  Been on Sertraline 200mg for 2 years. Ate Diazepam 2.5mg like smarties after a relationship with an Anti Social Personality Disordered Man. Been taking Quetiapine since December '15 and slowly moved up to 125mg to increase to 200mg. Was taking 7.5mg Mertazipine for sleep though have now removed it due to increase of Quetiapine and weight gain. Overall I'm feeling much calmer, more rational, less reactive and more confident talking to people. After intrusive thoughts, cognitive dissonance, depression, anxiety, insomnia, crying, dissacociation, nightmares etc I'm happy!",6,30
Seroquel,The only good side was that it helped me sleep good. But couldn't even get up in the morning I was so drowsy still and felt hung over bad Also I was very lethargic. Like numb and I felt numb. Like crap Almost like seriously depressed without depression state of mind Horrible.,1,24
Seroquel,"Weight gain, lethargic 300 dosage at bed time, any more you'll have heads turning in public. Reclusion is a major problem do to zombie affects, messed up part is my roommates had to tell me cuz I didn't even notice. I have not been able to get a job. I tried college and it didn't work. My short term memory is short, can't even remember what I ate for dinner three days ago. I do sleep though. All you can do is push on and forget gl",3,19
Seroquel,"My liver has always looked fine on ultrasounds.  Since I've been taking Seroquel (4 years)  my liver is enlarged, fatty and dense. However, I have been on various anti depressive meds for 35 years and the liver has to process this every day. It also made me drowsy. Don't know if Seroquel made my liver this way or just all the years on meds. I am currently coming off Seroquel and onto Lamictal and Rexulti. Fingers crossed! Good luck to you all, it's a very tough condition to live with!",6,12
Seroquel,"Hmm about this medication...I literally do not reccomend it at all! As someone with Bipolar2 I was put on Seroquel for my rapid unstable moods, I was on it for quite some time and I noticed the rapid weight gain not just that but I was literally sleeping all the time! When I was awake I felt like a zombie. Quite frankly it's a nightmare! Thank god I went off it.",1,27
Seroquel,"I have been medically treating my Bipolar Disorder for 11 years. Finding the right medication and the proper doses is tremendous work. You may find that seroquel is not helping you but that may not be true, you may not have  found the right dose and inital side effects do subside. I take 900mg lithium/400mg seroquel /400mg lamotragine. Up until 2013 I was in/out of serious episodes that would last for months and destroy my life. I was taking 150mg of seroquel and my doc was hesitant to increase my dose. This increase of dose saved me. I am no longer controlled by this disease, rarely have episodes. I do hate seroquel for sedation/panic attacks at night, lucid nightmare, weight gain. BUT I have my life back and the negatives are so worth it!",8,29
Seroquel,Made me a complete zombie. Threw them out.,1,16
Seroquel,"Although my doctor prescribed it mainly for Bipolar Depression, he will temporarily increase the dose in response to emerging manic symptoms especially racing thoughts, agitation, extreme irritability and dilusions.     Positive - Significantly (80-90%) calms my thoughts. Helps me fall and stay asleep.  Keeps my depression in check. I am now compliant with all of my medications and trust my doctor. Negative - higher doses blunt my affect. I must take my dosage at bedtime because of tremendous sedation which is when the drug saturation is highest in my blood and brain. If I must get up during the night, for example bathroom, I'm disoriented and dizzy. I could never take it during the day. Weight gain from munchies. Sex-related problems",8,33
Seroquel,"Hey all, I am writing both as a user and a person seeking additional information on Seroquel XR. I have been on it for about three months. I have found that it eliminated the manic phase of my diagnosis, as well as anxiety. However, tapering back and forth due to side effects has made it difficult to make consistent observations and I have suffered depression and even suicidality as a result. What have others experienced on this topic? I understand bipolar disorder is a multifaceted illness and therefore should be treated from both angles. Are most of you on more than one medication in conjunction with seroquel? I understand I have also had a difficult time taking it as prescribed and this may have hindered my results. Thank you.",5,16
Seroquel,"I spent months on this medication and all it ever did for me was make me drowsy, all I ever did was sleep, not worth the toxicity to your liver",3,14
Seroquel,"Made me feel like a zombie. I slept too much, gained 20lbs, had restless leg syndrome and congestion at night, increased depression ,  I  had a breakdown of laughing and crying at same time. I lost of reality.",2,30
Seroquel,I have had a  negative experience.I was mad at my self because i went against my better judgment. I knew that this one was a weight gaining pill. I kept telling my doctor that I was gaining weight from this pill he  insisted that it had nothing to do with seriqul xr he continued to say its what I was eating. I told him last week on the phone he said what have you been eating I went on a fast normally before seriqul  I would just lose the extra weight when I went on a diet.  This time a week went by it got even worse So I am very happy that I just stopped taking it.  It is not worth it. I had a doc for 10 years prior to this one and I had never been diagnosed with bi polar -  he calls it a mood disorder. I know I have it and I am open to something new,1,14
Seroquel,"Seroquel, 50mg nightly in addition to Lithium (2 x 200mg) and Cipramil (20mg) a dream combo for me. Stops the racing thoughts and knocks me out cold for 8 hours / night. Slight weight gain of maybe 2-3 kilos but hardly noticeable. I'll take the extra weight over hypomania and insomnia any dat.",8,30
Seroquel,"I have had severe depression and anxiety for a long time. Adding to that, I was sexually assaulted and now also have PTSD. Long story short, I became addicted to opiates and am now in recovery. Being in recovery, I embarked on a journey to get my mental health under control. I was diagnosed with Bi Polar 2 and PTSD. I take Seroquel at night with Lamictal, and Lithium twice daily. The Seroquel is a must for me. After five years of flashbacks, panic attacks, and night terrors over my rape, I can finally get a full night of sleep. I have asthma and it doesn't bother it, and I'm on 100mg per night. I saw one reviewer say do not take seroquel if you have asthma. The truth is EVERYONE is different. Seroquel works great for me.",9,34
Seroquel,"I tried taking Seroquel when I was a teenager. Everytime I took it it would knock me out &amp; I would sleep the whole day away. Needless to say, I wasn't on it for very long.",1,11
Seroquel,I was on this med in 2010 for a year. The dose went from 25mg up to 400mg. The first few weeks were very difficult. It knocked me out cold and I had such a blocked nose I could hardly breathe. I toughed it out and my depression lifted. I stopped taking it because of really bad blocked nose. I have just had a major depressive episode (2015) with insomnia. I was prescribed 100mg. It worked within 24 hours. I was able to sleep for 9 hours and feel refreshed and energized. The depression and anxiety have improved dramatically. This time I'll stay on Seroquel.,10,42
Seroquel,I almost passed out on 20mg.'s. My pulse was a dangerously low 40 b.p.m.. This is a very dangerous drug that has been linked to sudden deaths when combined with at least 12 other medications.,1,24
Seroquel,"I have a child on Seroquel.  We've tried Abilify, Risperdal, and Geodon to no avail.  Seroquel seems to keep her psychotic symptoms at a whisper instead of shouting in her head.  My husband has also used Seroquel for his schizoaffective disorder.  He switched to Risperdal because the Seroquel was sedating when ingesting over 50mg and he needed doses during the day. Our daughter is on an average of 500mg a day with no sedating effects whatsoever and we're wondering if she just does not do well on this class of drug since 600mg a day is the highest she can safely go for her age.  Nothing seems to keep her psychotic symptoms completely in check, particularly her paranoia.",5,10
Seroquel,I am on 600 mg a day 2x300. It is being used to help with depressive episodes of bipolar which I get more than the highs. It seems to of helped stop the very very lows but I still feel low with little energy or motivation. My appetite seems about the same although I have put on weight but that's down to me not working now. Sleepwise I struggle to get to sleep but once I'm asleep I sleep for about 8 hours.,6,15
Seroquel,My Dr started me out at 200 mg at bedtime and 100 mg in the morning.  I have found sleep comes much more naturally. Esp after the 200 dose at bedtime.  And the 100mg in the morning keeps me balanced throughout the day.I am happy with my results for my Major depression.,8,16
Seroquel,Turned me into a dribbling zombie. Everyone thought I was drunk. Horrible.,1,21
Seroquel,"I am dx'd with bipolar II plus other psych diagnoses and have tried multiple meds since 2004 and all of them caused such horrible side effects that I couldn't take them. Now in 2016 I am willing to try again. I fought my Dr for many years and she insisted that If I would only listen to her that I would feel much better and not have to suffer with my rollercoaster emotions. The down is so bad now that I finally couldn't stand myself any longer so I  told her I'm willing to try Seroquel. I took it for a month only to find out that it causes VERY low libido. I know that sanity is more important than a libido, but come on!!! Isn't there an RX that works like Seroquel without the low libido effect? Help!!! otherwise this medicine is perfect.",8,23
Seroquel,I'm not sure how I feel about this drug helping with my bipolar. I'm on lamictal for that and was put on seroquel to help with it until I was on a high enough dosage of that and truly did not feel it made any difference. I have stayed on a low dose of seroquel simply because I LOVE the sedative effects. If there was an option on here for the reason we were taking it was insomnia I would have put that. I never realized how awful I was sleeping until this medicine. 50mg a night and I get an amazing nights sleep. No more waking up to every little sound despite sleeping with a noise maker. It's amazing.,6,23
Seroquel,"I was put on Seroquel for severe anxiety and suspected bipolar.  Let me begin with this.  Do not EVER TAKE THIS IF YOU HAVE ASTHMA.  You know that horrible drying effect that many antihistamines have resulting in asthma attacks?  This is much worse.  I started out with an 8th of a tablet (12.5mg).  This gave me a calm,  sleepy feeling that would put me to sleep for bed and would last until roughly 5pm the next day.  But when I upped the dose to 37.2mg I had a really bad asthma attack, heart pounding and my ears rang which lasted 2 weeks after I discontinued the med.  Not a pleasant experience for someone with severe anxiety.  Be very cautious.  Up the dosage more slowly than the MD recommends. I was to start 50mg/night",3,12
Seroquel,"Misdiagnosed as bipolar when it was GAD. Weaned myself off after severe blood pressure and white blood cell drops.  Dr. refused to help me stop this drug and refused to change diagnosis. I weaned myself off - it took almost 3 mos. it's been over a year and my sleep pattern has been destroyed. New doctor has me on Trazadone - 250mg, which I took in the past. Now the Trazadone only keeps me asleep 3-4 hours. White blood cell count and blood pressure have normalized.",1,13
Seroquel,"Seroquel is amazing for me, I take 100mg in morning and 300 at night",10,15
Seroquel,I have taken a low dose of Seroquel (100mg) for 9 months. Over this time  the full on cravings and my weight  have slowly crept up on me. I worry if  they keep going like this that I may end up with diabetes. I have put on 12kgs extra since I started on March 5th 2015.  I also have no feeling down there during sex- just feels like pressure or a massage- I have no enjoyment.  I am also on Lithium and Lovan. Neither of these medications have caused these problems in the past.  My boyfriend says I have improved since being on this drug.  I think I will with the help of my doctor take myself off this drug.,6,10
Seroquel,"Where do I even start? Been fighting my crazy mood and bipolar disorder since I was an adolescent.  Was prescribed this years back, and slowly I saw my life start to tangle up.  Mood problems got worse, could not feel much remorse or feelings, just dampened emotions that got harder to control.   I strongly believe this medicine harmed my mental health during one of the times the brain develops significantly.  Been off for exactly a year and still recovering.  Finally I can sleep through the night after about 10 months, but still dealing and slowly on the way back from a miserable journey of anxiety, insomnia, and instability. Mood should arguably be stabilized, not muted and worsened by this medication. Be safe",1,31
Seroquel,"Seroquel helped with my panic attacks and break downs, but it made me feel lifeless (which I prefer versus crying). However I experienced ever side effect listed and even ended up in the ER! My heart was beating uncontrollably and sharp pains, I thought I was having a heart attack. I had to get monitored for 6 hours. Also I lost strength in moving limbs. It works but too many side effects.",3,16
Seroquel,"I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder 10 years ago (recently found out it is actually PTSD/c-PTSD) and I was started on 1200mg of serquel. I was a zombie!  I didn't want to do anything but sleep. I was so tired all day. One day after taking my medication and then sleeping 10 hours, I then got in my car and was driving somewhere and feel asleep at the wheel. I total my car but luckily I wasn't hurt and no one else was involved. I lost my job. The best part though was the 110 pound weight gain I had in less then a year of taking this poison.  I've been off of the crap for about 3 years now but still can't drop the weight it caused me to gain.  Please be careful if considering taking this drug it almost ruined my life.",1,29
Seroquel,"I was on Seroquel from November of 2014 to September of 2015. This medicine, was terrible. By the end of me being on it I was up to 400mg. Before I started taking this medicine I was losing weight, and bam all the weight I lost came back. I was sleeping all the time, I didn't have the energy to do the things I loved. My mood swings were getting worse. I hated myself on it. it was awful.",4,21
Seroquel,l had immediate results when first taking seroquel l felt alot calmer and mood improved. Since then my symptoms worsened and l have found no benefit at all,7,14
Seroquel,Seroquel is great. Been taking it for seven years. I take 200mg at night for bipolar. It does take time to get used to it. I does cause me to get hungry 30 minute's after taking in it. Just eat a healthy snack. At first I did gain a couple pounds. Searching on line did not help. Everyone's complains how much you need to eat. It's self control. I make sure to exercise everyday. And trust me it's no easy. There's day I have no energy. But I tell my self I have 3 little girl's and have to make sure I do not get fat and unhealthy. I have bad mood swings with out it. It caused me to make it miserable for my wife and kids and coworkers. Driving was a mission everyday.,10,44
Seroquel,"My mom was prescribed Seroquel in 2010 for dementia ! I talked to my pharmacist. Tom, he showed me the FDA's warning; Seroquel had been given the highest warning Black Boxed  Mom had Dementia, was 75 yrs old, and weighed 76lbs, she died in October, '11",2,21
Seroquel,"I've been taking 100mg for over a month and had quite the reverse of increased appetite or weight gain, although this could be due to the low dose. But also I feel my manic behaviour is not necessarily under full control whilst the tablet also makes it near impossible for me to get up before 7am on consecutive days. All in all though I do feel more balanced, productive and a better sense of self purpose and an ability to plan realistically on this drug. Although at this stage I am keeping a close eye on feelings of paranoia creeping in. It can be hard to tolerate the side effects of this drug though.",7,10
Seroquel,"This was the first anti-psychotic I was put on, I was pushed into it by my psychiatrist at the time. I was on a low dose, 150mg. I took it for four months before taking myself off it due to extreme tiredness and horrific weight gain...I gained over 2.5 stones in the time I was on it, despite managing my food intake very carefully and exercising rigorously. A couple of years later I wound up being prescribed Seroquel again, this time at 300mg. Same as last time it really knocked me out and once again I gained weight. This med did nothing for my mood, but I kept being told to 'give the medication time to work.' After 6 months I came off it again. Since weaning off the med I haven't slept properly, and that was almost 3 months ago.",2,19
Seroquel,Worst medication ever! I took a small dose of 50 mg at bedtime and it gave me the WORST sugar cravings and made me eat uncontrollably!! I took seroquel for 9 months and gained 40 pounds. Do not take this medication it destroyed my health!,1,26
Seroquel,"Of all medications I have taken for mental illnesses, Seroquel has been the most effective. It started working almost immediately. At first 25mg nightly, then 50mg, to 75mg, to 100mg only at bed time due to the drowsiness that accompanies it. I now take 150mg at bed and 25mg with breakfast and 25mg at lunch time which is keeping anxiety at bay. It required an increase monthly for me until now. The biggest benefit was treatment of insomnia, which in turn helped me manage my days better. It hasn't been effective in preventing or even reducing the effects of mania which is why it didn't get a full 10/10 from me. The worse side effect has been the constant weight gain.",8,29
Seroquel,"I have been on Seroquel for over 5 years, with varying doses ranging from 50 mg/day to 400 mg/day, for treatment resistent depression initially and bipolar disorder II recently, and it's been a gift from God. It doesn't cause the terrible inner restlessness that older antipsychotics or newer ones like Geodon, Risperdal, and Latuda produce, and it's effective against bipolar depression. I would give it a 10, but the side effects can be hard to deal with (drowsiness, tachycardia, BP changes).",8,30
Seroquel,"It's a great  medication. It helps me out a lot, the only thing is the weight gain. I've gain 30 pounds being on seroquel, if only there's another medicine you can take with it so you don't gain the weight that would be great",10,27
Seroquel,"I've been diagnosed with bipolar 1(Runs in family)borderline personality, gen anxiety and epilepsy. I take 400 XR mg of serequal at night with 1mg lorazepam,60mg mirtazapine(SNRI), 10mg lexapro(SSRI) in the morn, 1000mg of depakote in morn and 1300mg at night, 100mg of lamotrigine in morn and 200mg at night-before seroquel I still had the mania and depression although less intense due to my other med levels finally correct, but once on seroquel the length between phases has been much longer, and to a point even lessened the intensity of the highs and lows more , Between phases I've felt more life, calmness, happy and much more. I totally recommend this drug. It's only major side effect for me has been weight gain(a lot of)",9,18
Seroquel,"I sometimes hear negetive of Seroquel. At first i had bad giddiness and light head.  I wanted to stop but was recommented to stay on it and I did.  I changed to XR and i havent looked back. Its been three years,  if I hear a off handed remark at the chemist thats its not popular, i tell them i would not change, i tried Zyprexa but it wasnt good for me, i lasted not even a full foil. Seroquel isnt too bad on the weight, and a better diet or and exercise would help.  For me this is a great med, and i dont want to change, it helps with so much,  it has many uses.  The tiredness you can have wears off and as time goes by your body gets used to it.  It is tiring, but small price to pay. Im sticking with Seroquel. I am a positive vote.",0,35
Seroquel,"I am on 700mg every day, my dose is always increasing. It doesn't knock me out anymore. I took 700mg a couple hours ago and I'm still wide awake. Each time my dose goes up I'm stable for a week or two but then I start to go crazy again pretty quick.",5,14
Seroquel,"Seroquel helped my mental status but I couldn't take being tired all the time and the weight gain was ridiculous even with eating healthy and working out six days a week. To get off of it you have to taper so slow. When I dropped from 12.5mg to 0mg I went through terrible withdrawals way worse than stopping opiates. Throwing up, flu symptoms, I lived in bed and was close to wanting to just quit. I was worthless from day three of stopping to day nine. I woke up on day ten feeling back to my old self and so happy to be free of this stuff they call seroquel",4,22
Seroquel,"I have been on this medication for about a month now, tried pretty much all ssris for depression and over time found out i had bipolar 2. This medicine work fairly well, helps your memory, and keeps your moods at a fairly stable place. I'm on 300 mgs now and I was on 150mg, all in all pretty good medication.",8,29
Seroquel,I have been taking seroquil for 18 months and have gained about 30 lb.  I take 200mg at night and find I feel as if I am starving and eat crazy amounts sugary food that  I crave. I find that when I wake my eyes have a haze over them for a half hour or so. If I miss a dose I can not sleep no matter how much I try. I get a clenched jaw and grind my teeth when I miss a dose. I was in prison and sometimes was not given the opportunity to take it. Those nights and days were long. I will say that it helps slow the mind down and it is amazing to get to sleep. With that said after taking it I was ready for bed in about 20min whether I wanted to sleep then or not. When I tried stopping I did not sleep right for months.,4,24
Seroquel,"One of the best meds for bipolar. Low frequency of EPS and no prolactin elevation, however I have gained approx. 10-12 lbs in one year, but that's a small pay for mental stability. Recommend monitoring blood glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol.",10,33
Seroquel,I used to be in a rage all day long but now after taking 100 MG of Seroquel twice daily and 200 MG at night along with Depakote i'm doing great best medicine i have ever been on.,10,27
Seroquel,"started Seroquel at night combined with Effexor during the day for bipolar and it's changing my life and saving my marriage. Where I used to have one good day a week, I have one bad day a week. Upped from 50mgs to 100mgs because it's effectiveness wore off mid day and recently added topamax because I've been attempting to lose weight (I have not gained, but it's harder to lose).",8,30
Seroquel,"After trying the most of medication for my depression/ mixed state, seroquel finally worked out. Made racing thougts go away and my mood is finally back to normal again. Feel happy and relaxed. I also take 150 mg venlafaxine. Best medicine i ever tryed is seroquel. No weigh gain for me. This medicine is a lifesaver for me.",10,52
Seroquel,So I started on this two weeks ago may need to go a bit stronger as over time when I was younger just tried to mellow out on illegal drugs. Seraquil is the best thing I have tried I am 32 and just been diagnosed with bipolar. Doesn't make me sleepy makes me hungry a lil bit. But has changed my life stopped the agitation and horrible thoughts that run riot in my head. Just slows it done and I am able to see clearly. I am only on a mild dose but in saying this I'm glad I take one when I can feel my mania coming on.,8,34
Seroquel,I have been on Seroquel for 2 years.  It really is a miracle.  It has helped with my mood swings and problems sleeping.  The only issue has been the weight gain.  I've probably put on 35 lbs and I've never had problem with weight gain.  The benefits of this medication make up for the weight gain.,9,55
Seroquel,"I've been on Seroquel for a couple months and I'm surprised at how good it works and how I have minimal side effects. I take 100mg-300mg at night and before my naps, just depending on how tired I already am without the medicine. Like most people, if you don't get ample sleep (8-10 hours), you usually wake up feeling tired &amp; groggy. It usually wears off within a couple hours though. I noticed when I take it my eyes become super red like I just finished smoking weed. I have experienced a little chest pain in my lower rib cage but it's tolerable. Other than that, I sleep like a baby; I have the vivid dreams which in my opinion is neither negative or positive. But it's helped in stabilizing my mood &amp; controlling my swings.",9,39
Seroquel,"I have been taking Seraquel for 10 years of varying dosage until finding the right balance of this medication.  It cured my insomnia and dampened the racingthoughts. Very happy with it for those reasons.  However. I feel very dizzy and tired around an hour after taking 350mg at night.  It levels out the mood swings.  Curbs  feelings of elation and empathy. Which is quite a price  to pay for steady moods. To conclude, Seraquel has had a very positive influence in the treatment of Bipolar Disorder. I think of it as preventative medication that quietens the mind. (Hence Quetiapine - it's pharmaceutical name).",7,29
Seroquel,"I lived with severe mood swings and major depression since I was 7 years old and I started taking Seroquel at 27. It changed my life for the better. It was as if someone had turned on the lights. I was able to identify negative and delusional thoughts and I developed massive insights into my mental health. I've gained 40kg in 7 years though and I'm now trialling alterntives. I had a severe allergic reaction to Saphris, but it did everything that Seroquel did and more. I'm now looking into Zeldox or Latuda.",9,21
Seroquel,"Been on Seroquel XR for 8 years. Can't believe I wasn't on this medicine when I was working , maybe I would not of been alcoholic for 40 years.",9,62
Seroquel,"Only on week 1 of this med, but I CANNOT believe the change in my mood. I am taking this to treat bipolar 2, anxiety and poor sleep quality. I take 50mg at night and sleep like a baby. Make sure to get 8-10 hours of sleep/night and you won't feel drowsy the next morning. It's eliminated my anxiety entirely and I feel completely stabilized. I haven't had any trouble with weight gain; in fact, I've already lost a few lbs, due to the fact that I no longer feel emotionally-driven to binge eat. No side effects as far as I can tell. An ABSOLUTE MIRACLE DRUG. Just praying the results hold up.",10,78
Seroquel,"At first, it was horrible. I felt like I was dying every time I would take it before bed, I felt as if I were to fall asleep I'd never wake up. This lasted 2 weeks maybe a month.... My body eventually adjusted to it, the voices went away. Slowly, but surely. I was also in a serious state of depression, and it takes some time but now after a little over a year of taking it, being bipolar and having countless manic and depressive episodes, Seroquel has saved my life. I've never felt like myself like I do right now in such a long time. The only dumbs down is you have to seriously monitor your weight on this thing, the pounds just pile up if you don't watch your weight carefully..",9,83
Seroquel,I love Seroquel but not the XR type. Helps you to sleep well at night and wake up feeling great. Gives you major munchies at night and woke up with Reeses Pieces all over the bed.  Does help with a lot on highs and lows. So for me it's worth a little weight gain.  Overall this medicine has changed my life.,8,100
Seroquel,"Seroquel has worked wonders for me.  I have been diagnosed with Bipolar 2, and after 7 months on Seroquel, I feel like a whole new person.  I had been severely depressed and was self harming before getting on Seroquel, and now I have never been so happy before!  The only problem is the weight gain - I have gained about 20 pounds since I started taking this medicine.  But this side effect is worth it to have my depression and anxiety gone!",9,80
Seroquel,"When I first went on this medication 300mg I did not like it at all. I had side effects of a type of floating- my head wasn't attached to my body- I'd be disorientated, only for a short time, but frequently at first. I don't really remember any other side effect.  I wanted to stop taking this. I was 300 SR then went to normal Seroquel.  Being on standard Seroquel helped.  I asked to change off Seroquel and was told its a good medicine and just give it time- 6 weeks. Wow, I didn't like that idea.  I did give it time,  I was tried of a day, so went back to 150mg- over time I've been on 200mg also and now 300mg.  I am so grateful to myself for hanging in there.  I choose to be on Seroquel,  I sleep a deep sleep, for me, I am happy. Very happy.",9,54
Seroquel,"Got diagnosed with bipolar disorder three months ago, and started on Seroquel 50 mg at night. It has helped me a lot, and I feel like a totally different person (in a good way - I've suffered for 10 years!). At first I just thought I was in a normal phase (not manic or depressive) - but the depressions usually sneaks up on me after a few weeks when I've felt normal before. Not had any side-effects, other than restless legs syndrome, but I've had that before, so it wasn't a biggie. This side-effect has also almost disappeared after a few months. Was so scared of weight gain, but I watched what I eat, and work out a lot, instead I've gotten skinnier and healthier. Thumbs up! I got my life back!",10,113
Seroquel,"I've been taking Seroquel for 7 years, after 20 years of delusional thoughts, mania, and large amounts of depression. It worked within two weeks and I noticed that when I woke up each day that my delusional thoughts were getting easier to identify and let go of. It changed my life. Since taking Seroquel, I have been able to learn how to drive, work in permanent jobs, save money, travel overseas, socialise, have a successful relationship and reconnect with the real me. I have also worked on my cognitive and emotional development and continue to attend counselling. I have gained 30kgs, but this has probably come about due to the combination of Seroquel, inactivity, diet and Sleep Apnea (of which I have only just been diagnosed).",9,75
Seroquel,"When I first took Seroquel, I had the side effects of a type of motion sickness, as my head would whirl about, and I never knew if I was whirling or the surroundings were.  I didn't want to stay on it, but was advised to give it longer. And to change from XR to regular.  I did,  and after about 6 weeks (from memory) I adjusted to it.  Yes, I was so tired, went to cut a 300mg into halves, then to 200mg's, now to 300 mg again.  Seroquel works for me, I've been on it for approx 18mnths or so.  I sleep, my mind doesn't race or think or roam.  I get a deep sleep.  I was advised to get up early and it will wear off- yes, that happens. But it's not easy.",9,60
Seroquel,This medicine turned me into a zombified eating machine.  I put on 30 pounds in one month.  It was also extremely sedating.,3,69
Seroquel,"I was prescribed 50mg of Seroquel at bedtime to help sleep. It works wonders for that, it didn't help much with my anxiety. I also take 1,000mg of Depakote per day and 20mg of Dexedrine ER for ADHD. The Depakote is no longer effective enough and my doctor is thinking about switching me to Lithium.",9,37
Seroquel,"Seroquel helped my paranoia and really kept me mentally stable, but I also was tired all the time, sometimes sleeping for 15 hours a day. I also gained 30 pounds within three months of being on Seroquel. I wouldn't recommend this medicine for anyone who does not wish to rapidly gain weight.",6,47
Seroquel,"Somewhat hit or miss on mania, racing thoughts and the like. Pretty effective as a sleep aid though.  Currently taking 300mg as needed as it was mainly prescribed for sleep. It is as effective as benzodiazepines in that regard, without the benzo withdrawal. It does leave me feeling gritty and nasty the next morning though, but it's better than insomnia.",8,43
Seroquel,Seroquel has worked wonderful for me so far! Levels out my ups and downs. No racing thoughts. Doesn't make me aggressive. Helps with my post traumatic stress disorder also!,8,93
Seroquel,When first diagnosed another medication was prescribed.  I then researched Seroquel.  Being an insomniac I asked my PVC if I could try it. It made life so much easier.  I began to control my agitation with others. I used to fly off the handle and what I call my crazy would come out. If looks could kill I would be guilty of numerous killings. I am able to be in situations that are less than desirable without offending anyone.  It was a challenge being around others who were not as intelligent and immature whereas now I recognize how I should interact with them. My true personality is seen rather than the perception that followed me for the majority of my life.,10,118
Seroquel,Helps you stable and calm,10,56
Seroquel,"I was on Seroquel for a year. I was fat, no energy, restless leg syndrome and elevated glucose. Seroquel has too many serious side effects.",2,90
Seroquel,"Took for bipolar. Good side effects: more or less consistently put me to sleep every night. Bad side effects: gained roughly 20 lbs 6 months in, had a difficult time getting up every day, needed more sleep than usual. It helped for awhile, but it mostly made my episodes less severe, did not effectively stop or prevent them.",7,76
Seroquel,"Prescribed 600mg for bipolar 1, first three weeks nasty but stick with it these side effects disappear. Taken alongside lithium and I have never felt so well in over 20 years, awesome.",9,68
Seroquel,"Seroquel is amazing for me, gave me good nights sleep, calms me down. I take 800 mg along with Tegretol 800 mg.",10,40
Seroquel,"Seroquel gave me my life back, calms me down and helps me think clearly during the day, and helps me sleep well during the night. Makes your mouth a bit dry and makes you hungry often but definitely worth it.",9,84
Seroquel,"I was off meds for awhile and thought I was fine - nope!  Had a manic episode.  I take 100 to 150mg of Seroquel at night.  Before this, I took Geodon and lost weight, but I had uncontrollable muscle movements, I didn't want to switch but my family was embarrassed by my non stop hand movements.  I switched to Seroquel and feel a million times better.  I sleep great (used to not sleep for days).  BUT, I have gained 40 lbs.  I wake up the next morning and see what I ate the night before and get so irritated with myself.  It makes me want to eat everything bad for me.  If I don't eat, it's like an itch I can't scratch. I don't feel foggy, but well rested...then again, I sleep till 8 or 9am. To me, it's worth the weight gain to feel stable.",9,81
Seroquel,I take 400 mg Seroquel at bedtime. I sleep a lot better but as far as my bipolar symptoms I see no real difference.,7,28
Seroquel,"I take Seroquel for bipolar, I had side effects when first taking it such as couldn't wake in the morning and sluggish, it took me a couple of months to get used to it, now I take it at about 10.30pm asleep within 20 mins and up at about 8.30 am, well rested, it has been great for my mania, which can last weeks at a time. I feel so normal again, I take 100mg a night with 600mg of Tegrotol you just have to give it time to do it's thing, the side effects go away. I have no weight gain at all on Tegrotol, it's the opposite, I'm losing weight.",9,54
Seroquel,"This is my 2nd time on seroquel and now that I actually know two shits about mental disorder, I really do like seroquel. I've always had a terrible time falling and staying asleep which it helps with greatly, and my ridiculous bipolar tendencies it puts to rest. I recommend seroquel if it works for you. I've never had a single negative side effect from it but some people do. Every brain is different :)",10,125
Seroquel,"I have just started Quetiapine (Seroquel) going form 25mg to 75mg now. I was previously using lithium and have gradually reduced it to 250mg, now I do not take it and have replaced with seroquel. I am concerned about the side effects at higher doses and I would like to know if anyone has gone from using lithium to seroquel as a modd stabilsier. I am doing this as I am trying to get pregnant and my doctor has told me that seroquel is a good substitute up to the 2nd trimester of a pregnancy where I would re-introduce lithium.",6,23
Seroquel,"I have been a bipolar as of 26 years. After my first and huge depression, I have not missed lithium not even for a day. I have had a really good acceptance to Seroquel, but not to Seroquel XR. The difference is huge, and XR plays with your sleep patterns and more. The insatiable hunger is so, so, true as is the weight gain. I just eat less and less and less and as a person who has had an amazing metabolism, still am 105lbs. After 3 children, my teen weight, I am now at 115lbs and I hate it. But I have no desire to stop Seroquel.",9,48
Seroquel,"I've been taking Seroquel for about a year and I can honestly say I don't ever want to live without it.  No other medicine had any effect on controlling my extreme mood swings and delusional/psychotic thinking. The sleepiness (which I now find very helpful) and morning fog were bothersome, but I've gladly adapted my schedule to allow 8-9 hrs sleep nightly.",10,81
Seroquel,It worked well for sleep but I could not remember eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I woke up with it all over my pillow and cheeks weird.. I felt hung over in the morning. Also was taking Geodon and Effexor. I don't take anything now. It's been 3 years. I'm doing good.,10,56
Seroquel,I too gained masses of weight taking Seroquel but lost it all (35lb) in 6 months by healthy eating &amp; being AWARE of the pitfalls. Seroquel does not make you gain weight. Seroquel makes you crazy HUNGRY craving all the bad stuff  - salt/sugar/fried food for me. The secret is to ANTICIPATE your munchies. Prepare a large but healthy snack in advance or save half your evening meal and have it at bedtime just before you take your meds. This really worked for me. Taking my meds on a full stomach took the cravings away.,8,152
Seroquel,"I suffer from mainly depression and anxiety.  I have had a few bouts of hypomania.  This was recommended to me to help anxiety and mood swings.  Within an hour of taking this medicine I was always somewhat buzzed and not in a good way.  Like you have to lie down and sleep or you will become extremely irritable.  The sleep was great on it, however you wake up in a fog for hours.  Usually until dinner time for me.  It really flattens you out so you don't feel much but emotionless and tired.  I took anywhere from 50 to 200 mg and the result was the same.  I am off now and trying safer meds.  Seroquel wasn't for me, glad it helps millions though!",5,61
Seroquel,"I was diagnosed bipolar about 15 years ago and have been on and off many medications.  I now have insomnia and Seroquel is the only medication I have found that will help me sleep (besides Geodon which gave me involuntary muscle spasms) I take 100mg a night. It does make me sleep a lot, which I really like. I usually sleep from 11pm to 8:30 or 9am.  Thankfully I don't have to be up early for any reason.  I feel so stable and happy and rested on it.  The reason I rated it a 9, instead of 10...major weight gain.  30lbs and it hasn't stopped.  I did recently try to switch to Latuda because of weight gain and I was miserable with no sleep.  I wish Geodon had worked because I actually lost weight on that.",9,40
Seroquel,"This medicine worked at first, but after taking it for a few (2) weeks, I developed anxiety &amp; panic attacks. I've had panic attacks in the past but not like these. I wasn't afraid of anything specific; it was like a constant fear. Also, my heart would race so bad. I am being weaned off this &amp; switching to Zyprexa.",1,46
Seroquel,Seroquel 100mg saved my life. For 9 months I did not sleep because of an anxiety disorder.  I tried to kill myself three times.  Finally i was given Seroquel and 130mg trazadone. I have been sleeping well and not depressed for ten years. It has saved my life I am so grateful. Did put on 50lbs better that than being dead. Very grateful.,10,59
Seroquel,"I have tried just about every medicine there is to treat bipolar disorder, and Seroquel hands-down is the best one for me in terms of stability. However, the weight gain has been a problem. I gained 40 pounds on Seroquel. The good news is I've lost 16 pounds of that in 3 1/2 months. It's been hard work, but I am confident I can meet my goal of losing 48 more pounds over the next year.",9,49
Seroquel,"I have bipolar, obsessive compulsive disorder, severe anxiety, panic attacks and I cannot shut my mind off without Seroquel. I take 800mg at bedtime and cannot sleep without it.",10,57
Seroquel,"I have had Bipolar one for 8 years now. I use 50 mg of Seroquel, with 100 mg Lamictal, and 900 mg of Trileptal.  Seroquel is great for sleep, which is critical for me. I also use good sleep hygiene with the Seroquel to make sure I get my 8 hours every single night. I am managing my bipolar very well, and for this I am very thankful to these medicines.",0,34
Seroquel,Seroquel is fantastic.  I've been taking it for bipolar and inability to sleep. The only problem I've had is severe restless leg syndrome.  That side effect is knocked out by 2 mg of Requip.,10,36
Seroquel,"Works well, it has helped me out a lot.",9,22
Seroquel,"I have Bipolar I Disorder, and was prescribed Seroquel for insomnia and anxiety.  At only 25mg, it helps me sleep like a baby.  I get 8 hours of the most restful sleep I have ever had. It also helps with the racing thoughts and screaming voices in my head.  I cannot thank God enough for bringing this medication into my life.",9,121
Seroquel,I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 14 years old I am now 34 years old. I have been many different medications for my bipolar. Seroquel has been a wonderful medication. I take 1000mg at bedtime. I have been on it for almost 16 years. It works well for me.,10,73
Seroquel,You can be very angry and go off on someone and then you take this medicine and then you think that you never went off on that person.,10,53
Seroquel,"I just started taking Seroquel(50mg) for now at bed time, and will eventually increase the dose to 150mg when told to by my doctor. So far, I have experienced serious trouble waking up the next morning, but my doctor says this will go away as I continue to take it. As a teenager, I can honestly say it has helped so far, and that I highly recommend it to others who have struggled as I have.",7,46
Seroquel,"I had great success at doses of 200-400mg. Anything above that and I black out an hour after taking it. I found out later I had been writing belligerent texts, yelling at my children, and verbally abusing my wife. Im going to ask for 300mg since it helped my insomnia, and made me content and happy the next day.  All without the horrible side effects listed above.  I have tried Geodon, it gave me severe tachycardia, and yet made me too tired to function. A horrible inescapable feeling as the tachycardia made sleep impossible. Zyprexa just made me fat and gave me restless legs so bad I couldn't sleep. Seroquel is best by far, but have your loved ones monitor you.",8,53
Seroquel,"I was prescribed 200-700mg for bipolar with psychotic features. At 200-400mg I slept well and woke up happy and felt content. Some symptoms remained, thus the increase to 700mg. At that level I had nightly blackouts where I would write belligerent texts to loved ones at night, and have no memory of it. I was horrified to learn of it later. I've tried Geodon and Zyprexa with bad results like drooling somnolence and tachycardia. Next doctor visit I will ask to be put on 300 Seroquel. I had good results at that level, and wish to return to that. Looking forward to it. I'm not on any anti-psychotic currently and I feel anxious.",8,32
Seroquel,"Slight improvement in mood, yet still witness episodes of bipolarity/depression, sometimes lasting more than 24 hrs in duration (previously these episodes could last a week or more) not so down and out all the time, negative effect on sexual 'drive', no real urge to even engage with the opposite sex, let alone participate in sexual activity",5,35
Seroquel,"Took for bipolar disorder (for the depression). In small doses, this caused me to be too sleepy to function. When I took a large dose at night however, it knocked me out and I was good the next day. This really did help with the depression and mood swings. However, it caused significant weight gain. I had to stop taking this when a job had ended and I no longer had insurance. I fought insomnia for around 6 months, but after that time was finally able to sleep again and the weight came out. I would recommend this for someone who really needs it, but not until other medicines have been tried first with no success.",7,49
Seroquel,I have found Seroquel to be very helpful in my life. I was on high antidepressant medicines but gave those up. The Seroquel helps me lead a normal life by allowing me to sleep and calm down after long working hours in a high demand job. I take 100mg before dinner which helps my appetite also. I would not take Seroquel during the day as I feel it would inhibit my ability to communicate at work.  From what I've read some interpolate the effects of the medicines in differing ways but I can honestly say it has saved me from a very dark place.  Expensive but worth the cost.,10,48
Seroquel,I took Seroquel for a year and a half. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I can say for the most part the medicine did help me. I was taking 50mgs because I have kids. It helped me along with therapy to deal with my depression. I had to stop.,8,21
Seroquel,I was prescribed this for sleep and my doctor told me it has multiple uses and can be used for Bi Polar as well. Unfortunately this medication causes auditory hallucinations I am a 24 year old male and I will have to have a talk with my doctor about this.,2,33
Seroquel,"I have bipolar problems and I'm taking 500mg Seroquel prolong once a day. It really has helped me on my mood swings. It's been five years now and I'm on methadone treatment too. I don't have any problems, I sleep pretty good now and I'm more stable.",8,21
Seroquel,Was prescribed this for voices and insomnia but is making sleep life and awake life a complete blur!,1,30
Seroquel,Love Seroquel. Changed my life.,10,46
Seroquel,This one is good for me.,10,27
Seroquel,"They started me on 50mg twice during the day and 100mg at night and at first it worked miracles.  Eliminated my panic attacks, I slept regularly again for the first time in ages.  But over time the effects came back and as I'm typing this I'm even having a panic attack.  And now I am up to 200mg twice during the day and 400mg at night.",7,24
Seroquel,Seroquel has been a medication which has helped me overcome many difficulties in life.,8,24
Seroquel,Seroquel makes me feel like I'm on a level playing field again.  I don't feel like my thinking's distorted and I don't cry uncontrollably like I have all of my life.  I have gained weight but I'm fixing to start taking Topamax to counteract that.  If the Topamax doesn't work I will still continue to take Seroquel.  I rather gain weight and be able to cope with life 100% better than I did before.,10,53
Seroquel,"After later years of my adolescence and early adulthood I was finally diagnosed (bipolar) and prescribed Seroquel along with lithium. Not only did I finally feel a sense of peace within myself I found that I no longer engaged in the reckless activity that I seemed to have no control over. This behaviour which caused so much grief and upset, nearly caused the breakdown between my family and which I nearly destroyed myself.  It does not get rid of my depression completely but they are not as bad and I find I can cope where as in the past I couldn't. I find that it's best to take it before bed as it makes me very drowsy which I find a good thing because in the past I found it very difficult to sleep. Hope this helps.",10,56
Seroquel,Makes me feel extreme fatigue and cravings for sugar are too much. Not really sure its working for me.,3,21
Seroquel,"I was diagnosed with BiPolar Disorder 1 about 8 months ago. My doctor put me on Seroquel 100mg. I do have to take it at night due to the drowsiness it causes. It has made a dramatic change in the racing thoughts and negative self-image I felt. I've also had a marked change in my insomnia. I was misdiagnosed for a number of years, and couldn't understand why the other meds didn't make a difference. I wake up feeling rested. I did have some vivid dreams when I first began taking it. I also get the munchies, but they have subsided considerably in the last month or two, and have dropped almost 20 pounds. This is magical as far as I'm concerned! As well as the Seroquel, I also take 20 mg of Lexapro and 600 mg of Neurontin every night. Thanks!!",9,53
Seroquel,"I was on seroquel for only a few weeks, but that was more than enough. I had hallucinations and gained a significant amount of weight in that time. It did help me sleep at night and helped with my racing thoughts, but that's about it.",3,22
Seroquel,"I am having Seroquel blues. Just recently my normal dosage of 400mg went 200mg more and that 200 I must take during the day. I am so frustrated trying to find out how long does it take for the body to get used to taking the medication during the day. I always feel like I am in slow motion and unable to be patient with others, having irritability and have to take naps during the day to overcome the drowsiness. I know this medicine is important because it helps with the mania, paranoia, and suicidal ideation.",8,24
Seroquel,I had a bad reaction to an anti-inflammatory misdiagnosed as bipolar.  This medicine causes psychosis in an individual wrongly prescribed it.,1,18
Seroquel,"This medicine is great for sleep and helping anxiety, but if you have responsibilities, work, school, kids, ANYTHING, then be prepared. I am only on 100mg and although I feel calmer and not so irritable, I just feel sort of dozed and no motivation to do anything, not even simple things like taking a shower or making something to eat.  I woke up this morning needing to go to the bathroom and it seemed like an overwhelming task and I was stumbling around like when you are drunk.  If you don't have to work or answer to anyone then it's fine because you can just space out and not have such negative emotions and feel better.",3,72
Seroquel,Seroquel has been a very helpful sleep aid.,9,13
Seroquel,I was put on Seroquel 300mg it worked great but after a few months started having severe constipation and bloating around the time I took it. Now on on another medicine to see if this resolves. Pray it does.,5,10
Seroquel,"Seroquel helps both manic and depressive symptoms, however is much better when combined with other mood stabilizing medications. Good for providing sleep, but it can be too sedating until you get used to it (just take it consistently and stick with it). Slight raise in appetite for carbs but nothing a healthy diet and exercise can't counteract which is what you should be doing if you have a serious mental illness anyway. A good first medicine to try, because it's a mood stabilizer (for both types of episodes), anti-psychotic, sleep medication, and anxiolytic! It's great for controlling anxiety and making you feel calmer, and means you don't have to take Valium or sleeping pills which can be addictive - whereas Seroquel is NOT addictive.",9,49
Seroquel,"This is an update of my use of Seroquel. I have been on 800 mg./day for over a year now. My doctor had to keep increasing the dose due to stubborn anxiety/depression. My moods have calmed down a lot, not so many highs and lows. I do still see a therapist which helps with coping with life stresses and behavioral difficulties. I sleep a lot, between 8-10 hours nightly. I still take a small amount of Ambien just to help shut down the racing thoughts in my mind. I am having a hard time with my weight. I want to eat the wrong things all the time. I'm 15lbs. heavier now then I was before taking Seroquel, but the Wellbutrin I was on made me not want to eat ever again so I was way under weight, 125lbs. at 58' tall.",7,13
Seroquel,"I used to seek out and attempt to prolong manic highs, to the point where I was nearly oblivious to anything outside of the experience of the moment, and I was able to put off duties and worries comfortably in my own psychosis. The antidepressants I had been taking prior (sertraline, Wellbutrin) seemed to exacerbate my manic highs. Seroquel has taken the edge off of the manic episodes, and allowed me to deal with quitting other medicines. It is highly sedating, however I would say it has a very minimal effect on cognition. I was far more concerned with my thought processing while under the influence of 2 anti-depressants and Vyvanse for suspected ADD.",8,17
Seroquel,"Since I started therapy a year ago my bipolar 1 disorder has evened out, but I sometimes have manic, depressed, or both episodes. Also it has caused disturbances in my speech, and uncontrolled movements in my face, arms and legs. The benefits outweigh the risks though and I am satisfied with the way it has helped stabilize my moods.",8,13
Seroquel,"I've taken these pills since I was 19 and I'm 24 now. First I had to take 600 mg and I managed to low them to 450 mg. I wish I could leave them, but I have learnt  I need them.So far they have helped me a lot. I do wish I could fight anxiety, weird feelings on my legs while I sleep and the hunger I experience 24/7. But it's a love/hate relationship between this medicine and I. I hate it but I don't think I can ever quit it. Sad for me good for the pharmacies.",0,18
Seroquel,"I don't mind Seroquel, other medicines made my stomach sick, but Seroquel helps. Didn't like weight gain, so I'm dieting. It's better than Geodon.",7,9
Seroquel,"I have been taking Seroquel (400 mg) for 8 years at bedtime for my bipolar II disorder - it works very well in calming the racing thoughts, the insomnia, the manic episodes and the overwhelming depression. However, it has caused some weight gain (20 lbs) and it does cause my heart to pound very hard about an hour and a half after I take it. Therefore my doctor has recently switched me to Geodon but I am still taking the Seroquel at 200 mg every other night because I was having withdrawal from stopping suddenly. Hopefully I will lose the weight I have gained on the Seroquel and will not experience the heart pounding side effect. Other than that, I highly recommend Seroquel. I give it an 8/10.",8,14
Seroquel,"Was taking it for Bipolar, am also suffering from insomnia and this helped both very much!",8,18
Seroquel,"I've had bad reactions to every mood stabilizer I've tried, but this was truly the scariest. I had to withdraw from college because I was sleeping constantly, crying for 8 hours at a time, and hallucinating. I eventually became suicidal and landed myself in the hospital for 2 weeks. I know that everyone reacts differently and finding the bipolar cocktail is a painful trial and error process, but if you have this experience, I wanted you to know you are not alone.",2,49
Seroquel,"At age 19 I have been taking Seroquel for more than a decade, as I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder extremely young. Seroquel is not a quick fix for an incurable syndrome that those diagnosed will continue to have to live with for the rest of their lives. Seroquel did not fix my sleep problems completely, although it did at first. Now I have to take extra sleep medication to quell my continually racing thoughts. I am still moody and I still do have meltdowns, but the frequency has decreased drastically. What Seroquel and other antipsychotics allow you to do is function in daily life to the best degree possible. I'm not saying everyone with manic depression should take it, because bipolar disorder is a different experience for everyone.",10,24
Seroquel,"I have been taking Seroquel 200mg for over a year for Bipolar Disorder. After years of taking antidepressants I couldn't figure out why they weren't working.  I was having really bad manic episodes that would last days to weeks, in which I was staying up for days at a time, spending money I didn't have and extreme OCD.  My anxiety and mood swings were spinning out of control and I was failing as a mother.  I started therapy and Seroquel and noticed an immediate difference in my manic episodes and insomnia.  I gained weight at first but have since lost it over the course of the year.  I am taking Aderrall during the day and I am back in college, working as a full time accountant and am able to relax at night with my family.",10,31
Seroquel,"I have been on Seroquel  (along with a myriad of other psychiatric medication) for 10 years at a dose of 600mg at night. For a while I would get so sedated that while sleeping I would stop breathing and jump awake feeling like I was drowning. While the medicine has been very helpful, I am starting to titrate it down in the hope of losing the 15kg that I put on when I started it. I now find it impossible to sleep without it so I'm coming off it very slowly hoping that my other medicines will keep my mood balanced. Overall a really good medication.",8,12
Seroquel,"BEST medication for Bipolar I Disorder!  I have had psychotic episodes my entire life, up for weeks, voices, could never sleep, screaming at night!  This medication was my savior.  Initially I gained weight.  I was eating carbs like crazy.  But after my moods stabilized I started enjoying life and the weight started coming off.  There are many different medicines out there.  If one doesn't work, don't give up.  Try something else, work with your doctor to adjust the dosage.  I am up to 600mg at night.  I wish I would have found this years ago!",10,26
Seroquel,"At the time I began taking Seroquel 4 years ago, my depressions were so severe that I attempted suicide and almost dropped out of college. Although my bipolar symptoms improved quickly, I dealt with extreme side effects (mostly a constant foggy and emotion-less feeling) until I reduced the dose from 600 to 300mg. Although my cholesterol has risen and life-threatening side effects of Seroquel have been discovered, I continue to take the medicine as I am completely unable to sleep without it and I can't imagine going back to the way I was 4 years ago.",9,18
Seroquel,"Seroquel only helped at the start and only with sleep. It has now been 10 years and it is making me a walking ZOMBIE. I have had major weight gain, I was a mere 120 when I started taking this medicine, I now weigh over 200 pounds. It is a nightmare for me. I still constantly eat. I can not stop.",1,24
Seroquel,"Good medicine but caused tachycardia, high blood pressure and panic attacks 2 hours after taking 300mg XR.",5,10
Seroquel,"I was having a blast with a manic episode, then the deepest depressive episode set in, and Seroquel is the only medicine that stopped it.",10,25
Seroquel,I was becoming very paranoid for no reason at all and in fact I felt I was justified!  This takes all that away and helps me sleep at night too.,10,20
Seroquel,"This medicine works like a miracle. It keep me very stable, I haven't got major mood swings anymore. With Seroquel I feel very stable and happy. I also take Depakote.",10,14
Seroquel,"I had been on Depakote for years for my bipolar disorder. But it did not help my depression. Antidepressants seemed to cause hypomania. After starting on Seroquel, I am sleeping better and my mood is more stable. I am less likely to have rapid cycling, and my episodes of either depression or hypomania are more likely to be short-lived.",0,22
Seroquel,"Seroquel is an amazing medicine if you have received a proper diagnosis. Since about age 6, I have suffered with painfully debilitating depression. Most days I could barely pretend to engage and talk to people. I would just sit in my room and cry for hours almost everyday. I also experienced horrible paranoia involving the belief that someone was watching me. My parents were very opposed to any medical treatment for my condition so I just suffered though multiple suicide attempts, self injury, and other serious emotional issues until the age 21. I finally gathered the courage to seek treatment for my condition.  After years of absolute hell on earth my life is back together, thanks to Seroquel.",9,38
Seroquel,"So far so good. I have been on Remeron (30 mg) for 3 years.  It stopped being effective almost a year ago. Since then I have tried many other things. Finally my doctor suggested Seroquel (100 mg at bedtime), in addition to the Remeron. I noticed the difference almost immediately -- within 24 hours. Severe depression symptoms have eased off and also less anxiety. Unlike others, I have had no grogginess with it so far. So, while its early in the game, Seroquel looks to be good so far. Will post update as my treatment time continues.",7,14
Seroquel,"I changed to Seroquel from Zyprexa because of uncontrollable appetite. I don't have this so much with Seroquel. I feel like myself now, experiencing emotions in a normal way as well as a better ability to think. Seroquel (as well as the Zyprexa) has allowed me to return to work full time after a long period of feeling I was walking around dead, waiting for the next trial medicine to work. These atypical antipsychotic medicines worked quickly - even in the lower initial doses I could feel a change. They gave me a life, to the point where I was able to have a relationship and now marry. My only problem is sweating, which is difficult here in the Tropics.",9,23
Seroquel,"I have been on Seroquel for several years. I am taking 400mg at bedtime to help with insomnia but mostly for bipolar. I have tried other medications to help me sleep like trazodone, Ambien, and Klonopin.  The Seroquel works but boy do I eat after taking this pill.  I'm tired of eating so heavy after taking this pill.",9,12
Seroquel,"I found this medication helpful with reducing hypomanic symptoms - mainly I took it to control episodes of violent rage which it did. It gave me tachycardia so I had to discontinue.  My PROBLEM with this medicine is that it has changed my body permanently (so far - it's been 3 yrs). I was one of those people who could eat whatever I wanted, exercise, not exercise - I never gained weight. Now I'm carrying an extra 10 kgs which I am NOT happy about. I can't get rid of it.",6,14
Seroquel,I started this medication and within a day of starting the full dose I was prescribed (300 mg) I passed out twice in about an hour and a half. I would NOT suggest this to anyone who has reacted to any other medication (I myself also experienced nasty side effects to Geodon).,1,11
Seroquel,I was given 25mg once a day in conjunction with Lamictal. I started hallucinating about a day in.  Stopped taking it 4 days later after severe hallucinations.,1,17
Seroquel,Seroquel has been a God send for me.  It stabilized my moods and stopped my extra thoughts or popcorn brain.  I take 600mg at bedtime and my psychiatrist has allowed me to take an additional 100mg if my mood gets ramped up.  I do get side effects from it like blurred vision and restless legs.   About an hour after taking Seroquel the restless legs subside and I am sleepy enough to get a good night's sleep.  I am prescribed benztropine (Cogentin) for the restless legs and it helps some.  After I take my medicine I do not drive until the next day as there is risk of an accident and getting a DUI.  I did have a rapid weight gain of about 40 pounds but I would rather be over weight and functioning and not hospitalized.,10,24
Seroquel,Taking for 2 years. Only side effect is dry mouth but this can be handled as long as you TAKE it with a full glass of water. I now sleep. Being bipolar I was up 4 days at a time. Seroquel gave me my life back. I hope it continues to work for me. Gained maybe few pounds. That's it.,0,29
Seroquel,"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 17 I'm  now 19. I was on Seroquel for about six months and it did improve my episodes to be a lot less frequent. It was a God send in that area, but the side effects were horrible. I gained about 55lbs in five months. I went from a size 4 to a size 12 in a very short amount of time, I became very depressed, I spoke with my doctor and stopped taking it, and I%u2019m doing fine. I have not had any episodes since June 2009 and the weight is coming off very easy. I just exercise three times a week. Overall I rate this medication with a 6 just because of the side effects.",6,11
Seroquel,"I've been diagnosed with bipolar type 1 for 7 months now and have been taking Seroquel along with another drug. I take 300mg twice a day of Seroquel and find it extremely wonderful. I find it keeps my manic and psychotic symptoms at bay, however they're not totally eradicated but minimal, and helps with my insomnia very much. For me I've only found that it made me drowsy for the first 2 weeks of taking it, some dizziness and it gives me dry mouth enough to be irritating but manageable. As for the eating I haven't noticed any real big change I've kept a stable weight and even lost some (healthily) when I do get munchies for sweets or otherwise I just have crackers or some fruits and veggies around and try to keep a balanced eating scheme.",10,20
Seroquel,"I just started Seroquel at 100mgs at night. Of course it makes me sleepy but it wears off if I wait a couple of hours. That's when I tend to eat. The only thing is I don't eat junk food but Bison which is low fat on a whole wheat bun. I too am in need of needing to lose weight. I am 205lbs right now and would like to get to 180 at the least. I don't have a lot to offer because only been taking it three days. I take 300mgs Lamictal, 300mgs Wellbutrin. The thing that gives me anxiety is the fact I look into the future and with no wife or parents.",0,15
Seroquel,"Was taking 175 mg of Seroquel to sleep - experimenting with dosage. Felt overtired and crusty. Weaned down to 100mg, then 75 at nighttime. Active adult male who works out regularly, eats well, but gets agitated. Any less than 75 mg mental mania slowly starts back-unpleasant. Would like to not take but the doctor wants me to substitute Lithium. No change with hair loss and diabetes as side effects.",8,12
Seroquel,"I have Bipolar type II and have been taking Seroquel for the past two years.  It has helped a great deal by stabilizing my moods and providing me with a good night's sleep every night, no matter what.  Each morning, I wake up feeling refreshed and in control of my day.  Used to take 300mg a day, but now I only need 100mg, or 150-200mg on bad days.  This was the only medicine that did not cause tremors or restless legs. I've been on Lamictal and Geodon which all caused tremors.  It got rid of the angry hypomanic episodes.  The 300mg caused only minimal weight gain (I gained more weight when I was on Lithium), and extra drowsiness in the mornings.",10,34
Seroquel,"I have been on numerous medicines both alone and in combinations.  Seroquel showed a nearly immediate efficacy (2nd day) for my bipolar condition, in combination with a mood stabilizer.",9,15
Seroquel,"I am a 49 yr old male - after a confusing and distressful life for myself and family at the age of 35yrs and a 3mth stay in hospital I was diagnosed as being bipolar. I have taken different medications over the last 14yrs (Seroquel, Tegretol, etc.) and after my most recent manic/depressive episode started taking Seroquel. I take 300mg at night and at present am quite stable with mood thoughts and sleep patterns though I do feel lethargic, drowsy and being on auto pilot  during the day and suffer aching limbs. This however is a small price to pay for actually feeling like a normal part of society for the 1st time in my life.",6,26
Seroquel,I am taking Zopiclone 7.5 and Seroquel 25mg so I can sleep at night. I also take Clonazepam 2mg daily and Effexor XR 75mg. I have lost about 10kgs and still not feeling normal per say. I have tried various other combos but this is better than what I have been on. Sleeping without nightmares and even though I get tired during the day at least I'm not awake half the night.,8,10
Seroquel,"This medication made me very aggresive, hostile and just plain angry.  This is after only taking it for a week and a half too.",1,25
Seroquel,"I've experienced a slight increase in blood pressure, but no other side effects.  I'm feeling more focused and energetic.",8,15
Seroquel,This is magic,10,21
Seroquel,"Seroquel worked for me during my rapid cycling last year and really chilled me out very quickly. Only bad thing to say about it is I found the level of sedation far too much, and it left me incredibly plastic the next day. Was a bit like a walking zombie, although it got me through the dangerous bit. Also meant as I have great trouble sleeping it helped that side out too, so all in all was very good for me. Came off all medicines 9 months ago. Now only on zopiclone for sleeping. So hopefully no matter how good it is, wont be back on it!",6,72
Seroquel,A wonderful drug! I can sleep at night now. It also stopped my mood swings which were rapid cycling. I feel really good on it! Would highly recommend it!,9,23
Seroquel,"It help me a lot and I can feel happy in myself for once in my life, being Bipolar and 24yrs. I take 600mg twice a day and it helps me when I sleep and throughout the day. I'm not moody any more.",10,20
Seroquel,"I am 53 years old and was put on this drug just over a year ago. I was diagnosed with severe bipolar disorder 13 years ago, I new something was wrong with me when I was 17 but bipolar was not really to known back then. This drug is by far the best thing I have taken ever. Don't worry about the weight gain after a year it will go away, it is a small price to pay for sanity. Everyone will get the munchies from this I eat grapes at night they do the trick have some in a bowl by your bedside this will help keep the weight gain down. Stay away from ice cream and eat yogurt with preserves in it or just fruit when you get the munchies 1 hour after taking it. I also take temazepam at night 100mg.",9,79
Seroquel,"I have been depressed most of my life. I have tried several medicines over the years, even tried not taking medicines. Racing thoughts of suicide, worthlessness, irritability, crying spells led me back to taking medicines. I started taking Seroquel about a month ago and take 25mg at night. It has helped me sleep and I have not experienced any side effects, yet. I have noticed feeling better during the day, not as many inappropriate thoughts as before, hardly any crying spells. I'm looking forward to enjoying life again, right now I take one day at a time and can make it through the workday - mostly happily.",0,64
Seroquel,"I have been on Seroquel 300mg for over 5 years. I suffer from bipolar disorder, with this you don't sleep. Also am a recovering drug addict, due to pain from back surgery. If I didn't have this medicine I don't think I could live.  This drug is taken with other medicines.",10,27
Seroquel,As a bipolar teen this is the only drug that has helped me to have a regular sleep pattern.,9,17
Seroquel,"I have been taking 150mg XR Seroquel for a year now. It is fantastic for knocking me out and taking all those racing thoughts and wild thinking away at night. I have very odd and random dreams but I don't mind it. The only troubles I have is that I lack all motivation to do anything. I have been doing worse in school, and my relationship has been falling apart. I just let everything slide. It seems like I just am in my own world and that I could care less for the people around me.",0,62
Seroquel,"Expensive if you buy the extended release, ($160 for 50mg twice daily a month). Not to mention very sedating, and weight gain.",2,11
Seroquel,"I love this antipsychotic.  We tried them all and this is the only one that did not give me akathisia - I know another person like me and same thing with him as well.  I have taken 600mg since January and it is fabulous.  Definitely chills me out and calms me down.  Does not put me to sleep though.  That stopped a long time ago - I think you get used to it and the lower doses are more sedating.  I have done some reading though and it has to hit a certain dose (I think 400mg) to actually hit the dopamine receptors, anything lower and it only works on histamine and would not work as a antipsychotic.  I now take the XR version as I was taking the regular version twice a day for psychotic symptoms, I don't take this for sleep.  Very nice overall.",9,22
Seroquel,"Seroquel really snapped me out of a terrible manic episode. The self-injury, obsessive thoughts and sleeplessness stopped within two days of my first doses. Currently it is a regular part of my drug cocktail, at a maintenance dose of 50 mgs. It is the only drug that has truly been able to hold the mania at bay. I have had weight gain, but I will select weight gain over a living hell every single time. Seroquel makes me happy to be alive again.",9,39
Seroquel,"I was prescribed Seroquel after I got out of one of those psychiatric hospitals and after a terrible bout with Abilify (extremely jittery and restless). Unfortunately, Seroquel affected me in just the opposite way. I consistently went up in dose, peaking at 600 mg for 2 days, then dropping back down to 300 mg. I was on it for almost a month but I was living in my own little world. I was very muted. It may have stopped the manic episodes, but the depression became worse, almost landing me back in a hospital after I went cold turkey. The good thing though was that I slept so peacefully every night. No racing thoughts.",5,19
Seroquel,I've been using this drug for almost eight years and have absolutely no complaints except every year no matter what I do I put on a lot of weight.,6,21
Seroquel,Seroquel has helped me a lot in the crisis days. However I have gained a lot of weight and get drowsy easily. I would recommend it if you are really agitated and full of anxiety and have racing thoughts.,7,30
Seroquel,"I've been taking 150mg at night for years. I sleep for 8 hours when I take it. If I don't, I don't sleep 8 minutes. I am a forty year old male. I didn't take it last night and I've been up for 36 hours and I can't even think about going to sleep.",10,19
Seroquel,"This is a very powerful drug. Eventually I got up to 300mg a night, it made me relaxed and I sleep like a baby.",9,26
Seroquel,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar One about a year ago and originally took Abilify, until I realized it gave me severe anxiety.  My doctor changed me to Seroquel which I take before bed.  It did take a while to adjust to how sedating it was but it relieved me of my insomnia. However, I have been gaining weight steadily since beginning Seroquel with an insatiable urge to eat about an hour after I take my medication.  No matter what I do to lose weight - 15 pounds gained since Seroquel - I can not lose the weight.  I love the fact that it seems to work well with my body and cures my insomnia, but there's got to be something better for me that doesn't cause me to gain so much weight.",7,50
Seroquel,"I've been on Seroquel for 5 years. I hated it at first because I was only in 7th grade, weighed only 130lbs and was on 900mg. When I first took it I slept for three and a half days. Now it gives me this horrible urge to eat and I can't stop. A few years back it was lowered to 600mg (still a little to high for my liking) but it has helped with my bipolar and my impulses. It does actually help but avoid being on such a high dose.",5,28
Seroquel,I gained close to 40 pounds in 4 - 5 months and felt like a zombie. Went from 100 mg to 400 mg and felt worse with each increase. I have been off the medicine for at least 4 months now and I am still trying to lose weight. Have only lost 8 pounds.,1,31
Seroquel,"A word to the wise: A psychiatrist prescribed a small dosage of Seroquel (at bedtime) for me (25 MG) to promote sleep. After a short period of time, I noticed an overwhelming craving for sugar--pastry, candy, milkshakes, etc. During proceeding visits to my family physician, I learned that my sugar levels were rising steadily, something uncommon in my previous medical history. Eventually this rise in blood levels developed into diabetes. Once this cause and effect was established, I ceased taking Seroquel. I no longer have an insatiable appetite for sweets.",0,75
Seroquel,I have been taking seroquel for three years and it has changed my life for the good. When I first started taking it I was tired but after about a week I balanced out.,9,32
Seroquel,She is a new and exciting person.  After 60 days on Seroquel it's like having our daughter returned to us.  New and improved...Happy and Engaged in Life.   Thank You So Much.,10,74
Seroquel,This medication brought me out of a long manic episode very quickly (which was a huge relief) but I couldn't bare the tiredness and lack of tolerance I had because I was so tired. I felt quite grumpy most days. The sugar cravings were wild and I lost all restraint with cakes and sweets. I guess I'm just one of the very few people it doesn't agree with.,5,54
Seroquel,"I use it along with other medicines to treat my severe Bipolar Disorder. It helps me sleep and keeps the thoughts associated with this disorder in check. I'm not constantly thinking bad, self destructive thoughts when I'm taking it. The only bad thing about it is the grogginess and the always hungry feeling.",8,44
Seroquel,"Seroquel is extra effective for me. It really helps my sleeping, bipolar disorder, hallucinations and my ADHD. Thank you Seroquel.",9,43
Seroquel,I am Bipolar II and cycle on hypo-manic to manic. I am on 250mg x 2 night and 1 x morning.  I was placed on 200mg x 2 Lamictal and reduced my seroquel to 75mg at the night. It seems I have been able to focus more and be motivated and lost 45lbs in the process that I had built up over 3 years. I place this down to sugar cravings from my morning dose. No major side effects in me.,8,32
Seroquel,Seroquel has helped me better than any other medicines for sleep and some of my bipolar problems. I highly recommend it.,10,50
Seroquel,"I was recently perscribed Seroquel, and I can tell the difference already with my bipolar. However it made me so drowsy and lethargic that I can only take it at night. It has helped me think more clearly and has lessened my manic and depressive episodes to where I feel almost normal again.",8,51
Seroquel,I have been on 400mg of seroquel for 6 months. It helped me sleep and also took away my voices that I was hearing. It works great but I feel drowsy.,7,40
Seroquel,"In the hospital, I received treatment for a significant manic episode with psychosis. I was on Geodon but it had stopped working so I switched to Seroquel. At low doses it was ineffective, however now I'm taking 600mg at night it has worked well. At this dose, after a couple of days I felt like myself again. I've noticed some drowsiness but in my experience with antipsychotics it will fade as I become acclimated to it. However, I am extremely hungry all of the time. Hopefully this will go away.",9,63
Seroquel,"After a year of insomnia, I can finally sleep.",10,58
Seroquel,"It worked very well, but it caused excessive drowsiness and also made me gain a lot of weight in a short period of time.  I took it for almost a year before I switched to something else.",4,66
Seroquel,"i recently started taking seroquel.  for years I had racing thoughts, inability to sleep (sometimes as little as 3-4 hours for days), my mood was that of a ticking time bomb.  My family did not know when I would have a mood swing.  Worse than that, neither did I!  I find that with seroquel I am able to think rationally and act appropriately.  Without it, I have had a LOT of trouble with impulsive behavior that has caused an immense amount of grief and struggle for my family.",8,174
Seroquel,I have been on Seroquel for 4 months now. I have terrible insomnia and racing thoughts because of my bipolar disorder. This drug worked wonders for me and now I can finally sleep at night without my mind racing for hours.,7,94
Seroquel,"For many years I have been impulsive and that impulsiveness has led to a lot of serious problems in my life. (Some of which were legal) Seroquel has installed a buffer between the impulsive thought and the words/actions that come as a result. I am now able to fully analyze a thought process and decide whether or not to act on it. I have noticed a profound change in all areas of my life including my musical abilities. My family and I are now benefiting from a more calm, and appropriate person.",10,146
Seroquel,My son has recently been taking just Seroguel - they took him off all his others and is doing much better.  He's only 14 so he doesn't say much the family has noticed quite an improvement.,8,62
Seroquel,"It took me down from a manic episode relatively quickly, but after the mania stopped, I just felt sedated all the time.   I don't love seroquel, but it has its benefits.",5,74
Seroquel,It helped me to calm my racing thoughts and get to sleep and stay asleep.,10,99
Seroquel,I have felt 100 % better since taking Seroquel. It quiets the racing thoughts &amp; has eliminated most of the depressive moods.Thanks,10,86
Seroquel,"Seroquel has been very effective in clearing up my thinking. It has also helped me sleep better. I am bipolar and had a lot of irrational thinking, but Seroquel has cleared a lot of that up. I was in a terribly blue depression but Seroquel helped bring me out of that.",0,145
Seroquel,"After suffering all of my life with depression and then later in life (20-33) with severe anxiety, insomnia, and a general feeling of restlessness to the point I thought I was going to crawl the walls, I was prescribed Seroquel. I quickly found out I had to take my dose at bedtime due to being so sleepy when I took it during the day. Seroquel has been the ONLY medicine that has worked for me to ease the symptoms of my Bipolar Disorder 1. A Big Thanks to Seroquel for making life easier for me!",0,219
Lamictal,"I did quite well on lamictal  for my Bipolar on  150mg. Upon reaching 200mg, I had unbearable anxiety, constant panic attacks, headaches, horrible nausea, and vomiting. I would recommend easing up gradually and staying at a lower dose if possible.",7,8
Lamictal,"It worked well but over the course of a 1.5 years, I had hair loss on my head and even body hair was not growing back. My tests came back indicating minor hyperthyroidism and I had constant constipation/gas. I gained a lot of weight too which is weird. It turned out the lamictal was causing problems with my biotin/vitamin b intake. After talking to my psych and stopping lamictal and taking biotin supplements, I could finally pass stool easily and slowly my hair grew back... though I sort of missed my leg and underarm hair not growing. My weight and tsh level went back to normal after a few months too. Overall, it worked but the side effects weren't good for me. So again, it helped me a lot, but",6,5
Lamictal,"Excellent drug for treatment of bipolar depression. When used in combination with venlafaxine , these drugs changed my life",10,12
Lamictal,"I was on 200 mg lamotrigine for about a half a year and did not like the way it made me feel. After voicing my concern that I felt flat lined, indifferent to everything, and lacked confidence, my doctor did not listen. I weaned myself off because it was too distressing for me and all this started to worsen my social anxiety. I know this is not the case for everyone, but if you have had the same struggles, then this may not be the drug for you.  Also, a more serious and medical side effect I had was heart palpitations, specifically tachycardia.",2,8
Lamictal,I was on buspar for anxiety and wellbutrin for depression. After getting on lamictal I was able to stop the buspar. I feel like this medication is good for anxiety and mood swings. I just overall feel better. I do have a history of peti mall seizures but was on no medications.,10,7
Lamictal,"Lamictal has completely changed my life. I take it in conjunction with a low dose of abilify, and the combination has kept me from having manic/depressive for about a year straight now, something I never thought possible. At first I was just on abilify a pretty high dose and while it kept me free from hypomania, it didnt really do much for the depression. Lamictal, on the other hand, has worked wonders in that respect. Very little side effects I wake up nauseous but it fades after about an hour, and its definitely worth it. Other than that, no weight gain, and I believe it may have actually increased my previously nonexistent sex drive. The best part of lamictal is that I dont feel flat or subdued. Im still having the normal ups and downs of life, but for the first time, I feel pretty confident that theyre not bipolar related. Its really been a miracle drug for me.",10,52
Lamictal,"Worest drug ever, made me very ill. Lost tremendous amounts of weight, and didn't help my depression or mania.",1,8
Lamictal,"My highs aren't as high, my lows aren't as low, and for the first time in my life I actually have the motivation to accomplish things. Really the only way I can tell if I am manic or depressed is by the amount of sleep I can get. I am so grateful for this drug. I'm on 200mg once a day, with very few side effects. I have wacky dreams and dry mouth, but that's about it-- I've just gotten accustomed to drinking more water, lol.",10,36
Lamictal,"When I started taking it I had the worst side effects (dizziness, diarrhea, blured vision, nausea). Some days, I couldn't go to class. I started with 25mg and went all the way to 150mg. But it is really working. I've been taking it for 4 months and I never been this stable in my life. I feel good, better than ever.  I underestimated the illness, but medication is the key. Therapy helps a lot too.",10,41
Lamictal,"I have been taking lamictal for about 3 years now, it has helped me tremendously. I initially started taking it for anxiety, as a mood stabilizer. It was an interesting prescription for anxiety, but it acted as a mood stabilizer for me. This was really helpful at the time because I was experiencing extreme, crippling, paralyzing anxiety. I was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder and has found this to help with some symptoms as well. Unfortunately it does not help me reduce feelings of mania. I do experience most side effects of this drug, but very mildly and manageable. I was able to function normally again after beginning this journey on lamictal.",10,21
Lamictal,I just started Lamictal a few days ago and am already seeing a huge difference in my mood. Im actually happy and productive. It does cause a bit of insomnia but other than that I havent noticed any side effects.,9,21
Lamictal,"Absolutely horrible,              Worked okay for the first few days. Then I went into completely hypomanic episodes and extreme anger every couple of days - week after over and over. Drove me to the end of my own wits and my families. Did not work for me.",1,16
Lamictal,"Ok, so I've been on several different antidepressants and antipsychotics to no avail. When my Doctor suggested lamictal I thought ok, here we go again..... well I just want to say I've been on 25mg for 2 weeks and just upped the dose to 50mg 2 days ago. I honestly feel so much better. She said it could take weeks, but it literally took about 5 days to notice a difference. My racing thoughts and deep depression are getting better daily. It's such a relief. I finally have some hope. I don't want to die every second of the day. The only other Medication I take is Ativan as needed. Don't give up! I can't believe this is actually working!!!",7,73
Lamictal,I have been on Lamictal 200 mg for six weeks now after a slow titration. Added to 300 mg Seroquel and 30 mg Cymbalta. Unfortunately I haven't noticed any improvement. I was recently diagnosed with rapid cycling BP II although I have never experienced hypomania. My mood swings from normal to deep anxiety/depression within each day. Wake up every morning with paralyzing anxiety/depression. My mood improves in the afternoon and in the evenings I usually feel fine - only to wake up feeling miserable the next day. This has been my pattern now for 18 months and I am beyond exhausted. I am meeting my psychiatrist this week to discuss my diagnosis and switching meds.,1,17
Lamictal,"I've struggled with bipolar ii since I was a teenager, unfortunately it was misdiagnosed as depression until I was in my 60's. As you can imagine I've been prescribed everything available beginning first with what were called tricyclics which were medications like Mellaril (thioridazine) Elavil (amitriptyline) to the SSRI's such as Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro Celexa and several others. I took other types of medications for depression or anxiety too many to mention all with varying and limited levels of success some were helpful for a time others not at all that was until I was diagnosed bipolar ii and prescribed lamictal. This medication along with psychotherapy has had a profound effect on my life I have to say I've never felt better",10,58
Lamictal,So thankful  for this medication,10,20
Lamictal,"I am an extremely sensitive person and my depression is easily triggered. I have BPD, PTSD, MDD, and ADD(inattentive). I do not have Bipolar Disorder, but this medication has helped me tremendously with mood swings. I used to have a mental breakdown almost every day from intrusive thoughts. I am feeling much better now. I am taking a low dose of only 25 mg. I request to start on the lowest dose possible of any medication and work my way up. I notice a lot of people are leaving negative reviews because of side effects. I have had no negative side effects and I do not plan to increase my dosage. Remember that the higher the dose you take of any medication, the greater the risk is for side effects. I would recommend giving this medication a chance!",10,59
Lamictal,"I've struggled undiagnosed with Bipolar2 for years- many times having it labeled and treated as depression (Prozac, Wellbutrin, etc, all of which helped the depression but made me manic).  The one time I was told it could be bipolar 2 at age 25, the diagnosis scared me (the idea of being on medication for the rest of my life did too) so I decided to go off of all meds and handle it on my own 7 years later, after multiple tumultuous relationships, tons of $ spent shopping, and some extreme bouts of both depression and hypomania I finally started on this medication Lamictal.  I have been on it for about 6 weeks and am up to 100mg and I finally know what normal feels like.. and it's not racing thoughts 24/7 or snapping on loved ones at the drop of a hat.   Almost no side effects.",9,65
Lamictal,"Was hospitalized for a first-time manic episode with psychotic features last year (age 25). Went through Seroquel and Abilify before finding Lamictal. Initially, it seemed to smooth out my mood swings so that I could greet the day and take care of myself without issue (I remember joking THIS is how non-mentally ill people feel?). However, I began experiencing significant short-term memory impairment and realized that my mood stabilization also felt like mood flattening. I stopped being a self-starter and just felt no interest in setting any goals. My cognitive issues and lack of drive led to my losing my job. It's now causing turbulence in my relationship for the same reason: I never seem to want to do ANYTHING except maybe watch TV/movies at home. Hearing my boyfriend voice the same concerns as HR before my firing tells me that this medication may be wrong for me. Time to talk to the doctor. I want to feel like myself again, more than I do now.",6,21
Lamictal,Totally useless for my Depression,1,10
Lamictal,"I have taken many different medications and this is the best and cleanest mood stabilizer. I was on 200mg. I do recommend it to people who are manic and unstable. It will help you get back on your feet and function in life. You will likely notice your mood is flatlined, but if your life is in the dumps then having a flatlined emotion is worth it.  You will not get upset over things that made you upset in the past. Disclaimer: It gave me some short term memory loss, and pounding headaches with hazy vision if I did not take the medicine at the same time everyday. Be careful with alcohol because the hangovers are extreme on this medication.",8,52
Lamictal,"I have struggled with bipolar depression almost since 13 years old. I'm 26 now and just 5 years ago I got diagnosed and treated  I switched doctors and medications many times during these five years, finally the combination that worked for me is Lithium 800mg  Lamictal 200mg Prozac 20mg  Chlorpromazine 100 for sleep I know it's a lot but because I fall on the depressed side more than manic.",0,20
Lamictal,"Ive been on this medicine for a month... I thought it was making me feel better, but its not.  Every night I have to run to the bathroom because of diarrhea, not to mention stomach cramps and nausea in the day. Which at first I thought was because of stress.... but then I did some research as I tend to be sensitive to a lot of medications. This stuff isnt working for me, needless to say I am to call my psych doctor ASAP.  Lashing out at my husband over stupid stuff isnt fun.... I feel like rubbish and I feel like everythings my fault. I seriously dont wanna be here, and I really dont wanna end up in the psych ward before I can see the doctor because I cant ever get the right medicine...",1,21
Lamictal,"I had been empty, depressed doesnt justify the way I was living my life. No matter how hard I tried, what medication I took. I couldnt  mom , House a MESS, relationships failing, Job on the line, alcohol being my go to. I started lamictal about 2 months ago and havent had one day where I felt like I couldnt make it through. I got a promotion, my laundry is done at all times, dishes washed, cooking dinner on the regular, I can get out of bed on Sundays which was a routine for years.  Lamictal was my miracle for bipolar depression. Easy to say without it, I dont know if I would be here. Now I WANT to be here, I want to succeed, self develop. Started reading self help books, listening to motivational podcasts. If you feel like there is nothing that will help you  I highly recommend taking a chance on lamictal. After all, when you have bipolar depression, what do you really have to lose?? DO IT.",10,95
Lamictal,"Cant imagine life without Lamictal, but dont know whether or not thats a good thing.",9,32
Lamictal,I was prescribed Lamictal over six months ago to balance out my extreme mood swings. It has taken a while but I am a lot calmer and don't get depressive or anger outbursts nearly as much. It's not a permanent solution but has definitely been helpful for me to be able to function and process my emotions properly,9,33
Lamictal,Lamictal seemed ok for my bipolar at first but once I started taking therapeutic levels I developed a horrible scaly rash that took a long time to go away,2,18
Lamictal,This med  Lamictal is fantastic for bipolar.  I have tried several SSRI  drugs and venlafaxine.  They would work for a while then quit.  Also tried seroquel and zyprexa.  I still have seraquel 50 mg twice a day with lamotrigine 150 twice a day.  That helps the best I have ever had.  I recommend this medicine.,10,27
Lamictal,It was rough with nausea for over 2 month  on Lamictal when I first was adjusting to the medicine &amp; the right dosage but now - almost 8 months in.. I feel the best Ive felt in a long time with bipolar! I have lost weight.. around 10 pounds which has never been easy for me to do but Im thinking its only because Im more stable &amp; level headed. I also deal with PTSD from childhood abuse &amp; early adult years. I take prozasin at night for it to curb nightmares. I did notice I began dreaming more often when I started taking the Lamictal &amp; nightmares... taking prozasin at night has done wonders.,10,27
Lamictal,Absolutely horrible experience. At only 25mg I experienced extreme nausea and vomiting. Only at 50mg it sent me into a mixed state. Couldnt reach 100 mg. It has worked for so many people. It just wasnt for me.,1,16
Lamictal,"Lamictal changed my life ! Ive tried many bipolar meds as a teen - trileptal, seroquel , trazadone etc ... none worked and I developed terrible acne and side effects. So I went off bipolar meds and took only Zoloft for almost 10 years . Fast forward - one day I realized I couldnt get out of bed and needed help. I was insistent on trying a medication that wouldnt make me gain weight so I read a lot of reviews on here and decided to try Lamictal. It absolutely changed my life - the ONLY bipolar medication that has worked for me. It is like night and day - looking back at my precious behavior is baffling to me now.  Now no blow ups, I can function normally, no weight gain. I noticed a difference literally the day of taking it (Im very sensitive to medicine and in tune with my body ). Again - this medication changed my life . Thank you Lamictal !!",10,60
Lamictal,"If you have Bipolar Disorder type II, please learn as much as you can about this condition from professional, reputable sources so you can make informed decisions about treatment and management options. This is a treatable, manageable illness, take hope in that.   After 20+ years struggling to cure myself naturally &amp; being miserable, dangerously depressed &amp; dysfunctional, I finally decided to try psych medication.   I found a doctor who SPECIALISES in this disorder and is up to date with the latest research findings in this specific condition. If you don't like your current GP or Psych's attitude, find someone else! I started a combo of Lamictal (AM &amp; PM) &amp; Seroquel (Only PM - makes you drowsy). I kept a daily mood diary &amp; it took 3 months for my mood to fully stabilise. To help the bipolar depression, we added bupropion &amp; N-Acetyl Cysteine, a supplement (all based on clinical research!). For 5 years now, Ive had my life back.  Deciding to take this medication saved my life.",10,52
Lamictal,"So I have been in a really severe depressive state for the past 8 months. Feeling hopeless, anxious and destroyed. I was agitated and anxious the whole time. I was blaming myself for everything happening in my life. 6 weeks ago I decided to go see a psychiatrist because my social anxiety was worse than ever before. He diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and put me on Lamictal and abilify. I am now taking 125mg Lamictal and 15mg abilify. I honestly think that lamictal has calmed me down a bit. I am no longer agitated but still anxious. My social anxiety is still there and its getting worse. But I am slightly in peace with myself and no more blaming. The thing that concerns me the most is the social anxiety. I hope it fades away as I up my dosage.",7,18
Lamictal,"This was the first time I took a mood stabilizer. I have a rare case of my bipolar disorder coming on at around 1 so I knew nothing different for 35yrs. Now it's known bipolars need mood stabilizers then it was random antidepressants. My negative about the drug is it does effect your short term memory &amp; can dumb you down. My decision was to be dumb &amp; sane instead of smart &amp; out of control. I took the highest dose. After 4 yrs &amp; the birth of a child the medication became much less effective so I've had to change. I had forgotten how horrible I felt off meds until I had to change. Lemictal saved me, it helped me become a better person &amp; live in less pain. As with every medication for bipolar disorder you have to weigh pros &amp; cons. I would not recommend this medication for anyone working in an intellectual based job where memory &amp; use of math as such is involved. It can drastically lower your abilities. For me at the time it was more then worth it",7,33
Lamictal,This medication saved me from suicide.  I cannot Express how good it is.  I take 200mg a day for the past year.  Please if you feel like I did then ask your dr about It.,10,34
Lamictal,"My whole life I was depressed. I started using drugs at age 16. Which led to a 17 year battle with depression and addiction. It was like no matter where I was my mind would tell me I didn't belong. I've been taking this medicine for a year and a half. It is NOT a coincidence I got sober and haven't picked up a drug since. Its not a coincidence I'm a mom again, a friend and a daughter. This medicine allowed me to breath and swing with the flow of life optimistically. Its mild so its perfect. This medicine saved my life. Literally.",10,73
Lamictal,Lamictal  been the only medication that keeps me going. Not happily going but not giving up and I tried all of them including esketamine which just another drug used years before reinvented changed slightly and sold for billions.,8,5
Lamictal,"I love this drug Lamictal. After taking about 10 or so various antidepressants and antipsychotics over the past 3 years...Ive finally been prescribed Lamictal for my bipolar. After about 5 months on this drug, I feel like Im completely a different person. I take 150 mg daily alongside 100 mg of trazodone. Absolutely no side effects...and my favorite part? No weight gain!",0,36
Lamictal,I just started taking lamictial with  wellbutrin  for bipolar and it is the best choice I have made,10,28
Lamictal,"I 100% believe I would not be alive today without the Lamictal I take for bipolar. Before Lamictal, being alive was one of the hardest jobs Id ever been tasked with. Now, because of this drug, I feel like a normal part of society looking forward to living life. This drug showed me how important it is to take your mental health seriously.",10,50
Lamictal,I have taken many drugs for bipolar disorder in the past 20 years. Lamictal has been the absolutely best drug. I also had zero side affects on it.,10,24
Lamictal,this medication saved my life,10,25
Lamictal,Starting Lamictal with the smaller doses did not offer much alleviation until I was titrated up to about 75-100mg. It's been a wonderful experience so far with 100mg and I do believe it can be an extremely effective drug for Bipolar 2 patients! The only side effects I faced upon starting and a few days after titration include dizziness and mild insomnia.,9,20
Lamictal,"1st day taking Lamictal so I can only comment on 1st day side effects. Took it before bedtime, woke up at 2:30am with an anxiety attack. Couldn't go back to sleep. Continued having panic and fear, my mind was going 100 miles an hour. Finally fell asleep and had horrible, vivid nightmares. Woke up in the morning and felt out of it. Wasn't sure I was really awake or still dreaming. Then as the day progressed I felt better. For the 1st time in a VERY long time I feel calm. I don't feel edgy, I don't feel sad or extremely happy. I feel calm. I am still laughing and conversing with people. But not to the extent I was doing it before, I now have more control of my actions and words. I will not quit the medication. I am simply going to attempt to split the pill for a few days until I can get back to being able to take the dose without having anxiety. I look forward to taking this medication.",0,22
Lamictal,After struggling off and on with depression this medication Lamictal literally saved my life. I bounced from antidepressant to antidepressants praying something would work but nothing did. I had everything in my life so it was so frustrating. It felt like my soul had been sucked out of me. I no longer wanted to live. This disease cost me a marriage a son and a job. Life is so good now. I owe my life literally to Lamitcal. Please don't ever give up!!!!,10,70
Lamictal,I went my whole life undiagnosed with symptoms that started at 4 years old.  Ive suffered everyday. Within 3 days of taking Lamictal my mind was quiet and rational and my body felt as if a soothing balm had spread over my nerves.   Im able to focus and concentrate. My anxiety is gone. I could go on and on.  Everything is better. I could not be more grateful. Ive been on it now for 3 weeks at 50mg and life is good. I dont ever want to be without it.  If I get a rash Ill rock a rash because Im not going back!,10,48
Lamictal,"First I want to make sure that you are aware that Lamictal is the name brand and Lamotrigine is the generic brand. I suffer from Rapid Cycling major depressional bipolar disorder. It took me three years to find the right medication I'm highly sensitive to side effects. I tried two different manufacturers of lamotrigine and I had adverse side effects including panic attacks, severe anxiety, increase rage outbursts and many others. I requested to try the name brand of this medication Lamictal and my psychiatrist specifically indicated no substitutes on the prescription. Within two to three days I noticed a huge positive effect within two weeks I had a complete 360 degree change. Currently I have been on this medication for 2 months at 200 mg per day I've been told several times by people  who suffer with mental illnesses  that when it comes to mood stabilizers and antidepressants always go with the name brand.",10,29
Lamictal,"On Lamictal for bipolar and I developed cognitive problems, memory loss, hair loss, and other problems. Had many serious  depressive episodes and increase in anxiety while on it. Worsened sleep. Difficult withdrawal occurred when trying to get off it.",1,21
Lamictal,They didn't know at first what was wrong with me. Eventually after many different medications and mental breakdowns a very smart  Doc  thought I had  bipolar disorder and put me on 100 mg of lamictal and bam I'm way more stable. Thank goodness......it's cheap too,9,21
Lamictal,"So like most people, I started this on 25 mg/day then went to 50 mg/day. Ive been on 50 mg for a few months now and am feeling miserable. I am constantly on edge, irritable, moody, crying...I think I was better on just 25 mg/day but now I just dont know.",3,15
Lamictal,"Lamictal is an incredible medicine. It worked well for me as a mood stabilizer. However, it is theorized to block sodium channels and suppresses the release of glutamate and aspartate.  Meaning although it can help with mood,  it might raise systolic blood pressure in certain individuals . Unfortunately it raised my blood pressure so I had to wean off of it. I started off at 100mg as a sample dose; I was on it for about 6 months and noticed my blood pressure gradually got higher the longer I was on the medication. After weaning off of the medication, I returned back to normal .",10,7
Lamictal,"So I've been on 100mg of Lamictal for almost 2 weeks now, and I feel like my mood is more stable however I don't feel very excited in my day to day life. I dread going out and doing things and I just feel flat and bland. Has this happened to anyone else? I've been trying my best to get better but I can't seem to enjoy myself or my life.",3,34
Lamictal,"I became manic over the course of a couple of months of just 100 mg of this medication. I was on the verge of psychosis and started to have hallucinations. I did have a lot of stress in my life, but after 8 days of being totally off of it, I am feeling more sane and like I can function again without total confusion.  Scariest thing I've been through with my mental health yet. It felt like an acid trip combined with mania. I read a medical journal report online that it is possible to have a hypomanic switch on a low dose.  I think anything that works somehow directly on serotonin is not for me anymore.  **I took this drug at 400 mg. Many years ago and it did nothing to lift my depression and now this. Wonder if it interacted badly with a low dose of Ativan that I was taking for acute stress disorder over time. Still, feel better off of it. I still may try 25 mg. just for depression if I start falling into one again. Other bad side effects physically as well.",1,9
Lamictal,"I had an awful manic episode late in college. Was on a host of different medicines afterwards for 6 months. They were all awful and my body's reaction to lithium was like I had the plague. I was prescribed Lamictal, 100mg. 6 years later and many up and downs in life I have been stable all the way. I like this medicine because I feel no side effects. I take it and I live my normal life. What more could you ask from your medicine? Hope it works out for others as well as it has for me",10,52
Lamictal,"I have been on Lamictal for about nine months now. It is literally the THE BEST BIPOLAR MEDICATION I have come across. Right before going on Lamictal I was on the Abilify injection and although it kept me stable, it gave me a horrible side effect called Tardive Dyskinesia which for me showed up as uncontrollable mouth movements. My doctor recommended Lamictal after telling him my concern with the Tardive Dyskinesia. He first kept me on the Abilify and started on low dosages of Lamictal so that I can slowly ease into the new drug. If I remember correctly, he started me on 10mg, 25mg, 50mg, 100mg then finally 200mg which is what I am on now. I believe I have been on 200mg since about February of 2019. I dont  feel any weight gain, which I was very afraid of, although I dont think it is one of the side effects of the drug. Please please consider this drug for stabilizing your mood for bipolar, you wont regret it! :)",10,58
Lamictal,"Im 27 &amp; have been on Lamictal for about nine months now. It is literally the THE BEST BIPOLAR MEDICATION I have come across. Right before going on Lamictal I was on the Abilify injection and although it kept me stable, it gave me a horrible side effect called Tardive Dyskinesia which for me showed up as uncontrollable mouth movements. I work as a hostess at a restaurant and customers will make comments such as  Are you tired? You are yawning!  Or  Are you chewing gum?  and it significantly affected my self-esteem.

Lamictal,"I have Bipolar II and Lamictal  saved me. I was untreated until I was 40 years old and now I feel like a totally new person, open to people and situations that I would have been closed off to before. I was highly volatile, angry, and irrationally irritated all of the time,  depressed, or hypomanic and nonsensical. I am none of those things any more. I am grateful for this drug because I think I wouldn't have made it much longer without it. I wish I had listened to the doctors years ago and tried this. My entire adult life until now has been clouded by this disability, but I am happy to have the chance to try again now.",10,68
Lamictal,"Lamictal has by far has been the very best medication in my entire life.  It synced my brain and made my depression lifted 100%.  I feel happy, organized, interested in life again!",10,36
Lamictal,"Lamictal has been great for my bipolar disorder! Only 10 days on the medication and Im slowly increasing the dosage. Within less than 2 weeks I began feeling better, more stable. No more sudden emotional outbursts, overreacting over small matters, getting angry and going off on the people I love. I feel like Im going back to my old self, and its definitely significantly improved the quality of all my relationships. Im so thankful for this medication.",10,47
Lamictal,"I don't wanna ever be without lamictal again. I've tried a lot psych meds over the years but they either didn't work or had unbearable side effects. SSRIs should NOT be used for bipolar I or 2...many docs still don't know this. Lamictal controlled my moods and relieved depression with NO side effects. Nothing is a cure so you have to want to get better and work at it also. I love it, no one is the same, but please try it because it changed my life.",10,38
Lamictal,"As the reviews below say, I feel as if this medicine has changed my life. I suffer from CPTSD, Bipolar, Depression and Anxiety after being placed in a foster home at 7 years old and being separated from my birth parents. I still feel a little anger at times but NOTHING like before, I use to think the whole count to three thing was garbage but this medication allows me to do that and make RATIONAL decisions. I recommend this medicine for anyone who believes they're bipolar or depressed. The only CON reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is because I am constantly hungry where I am always thinking about my next meal which is very different but this just might be a personal thing. Good luck and good health!",9,38
Lamictal,"I tried Lamictal several years ago for mood swings without having received a proper diagnosis, and experienced extreme rage. I was also in an unhealthy relationship at the time and was taking about 100mg lamictal. Since seeing a psychiatrist, I have been officially diagnosed as Bipolar Type 2, and have come to realize that I am extremely sensitive to medications (and everything else on the planet). I have been taking 25mg (pediatric dose) of Lamictal for about a month now with extreme improvement in moods. Similar to another review - you don't really notice how wonderful Lamictal works until you are put in a situation that would cause you to be anxious or react negatively. It has improved my overall view of myself, I haven't cycled, and I'm dealing with stressful situations in a much healthier way. I also have not had any side effects from this medication so far! Highly recommend.",10,46
Lamictal,"I was prescribed this for Bipolar II and was told it would control my mania. It worsened my mania terribly. My personality changed, I acted like a crazy person and gained a lot of weight. I'm weaned off now and feeling better than I have in years. Be aware that the NICE guidelines say this medicine does not control mania.",1,14
Lamictal,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar ll and I climbed from 25mg of Lamictal to 100mg. Lamictal changed my life around. I was more patient, able to think twice before reacting negatively in situations, I felt happier overall, the anxiety I've had when driving was gone.  My life wasn't grey anymore, I was no longer angry for no reason, I didn't snap at the smallest things anymore. The biggest thing for me - I could FEEL emotion &amp; no longer was numb. It saved my relationship. I didn't have the listed side effects except for one. Unfortunately, I experienced the rare rash, the Lamictal Rash and had to stop it immediately :( Good luck to you! :) -Allison",10,34
Lamictal,All I can say is blown away at how well Lamictal works for my Bipolar Disorder. Took a full two months to take effect but I feel way better now. Wasted 11 years struggling on SSRI until I was correctly diagnosed. I never take the time to write reviews but felt this is good enough to take the time to share.,9,51
Lamictal,Been on Lamictal for about 2 months now for Bipolar and I love it. I was always diagnosed with depression and anxiety until recently. Since being diagnosed properly and taking lamictal I feel great. I no longer feel like a zombie and blah all the time. Lamictal really helped me get my life together. I have motivation and enjoy my life now. Love this med!!!,10,34
Lamictal,"I am autistic, not bipolar, but was prescribed Lamictal  (400mg) really worked for my major meltdowns. It has decreased my issues by 80-90%. My family can definitely tell when I forget to take it because I turn into a hot emotional mess! I wish I would have had this as a kid because it would have saved me a lot of unnecessary stress and anxiety. The ONLY drawback is that the pill tastes absolutely horrible. If I get a taste of it on my tongue, it makes me want to vomit. Sometimes it just wont go down with my other pills so Im left struggling to swallow it.",9,42
Lamictal,"I have been on Lamictal 200mg for 11 years!  This is in a combination with many other medications for Bipolar II! I always research my medications myself &amp; ask for what I feel is right for me! So far, so good!",10,36
Lamictal,Lamictal is fantastic for my bipolar. I have been taking it for 20+ years. No side effects. Started at 100 mg up to 300mg now.  Doesnt upset my stomach. I love it. Twice a day keeps the anger away.,10,32
Lamictal,"I've been taking Lamotrigine (the generic Lamictal) for just short of one month. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder recently after years of thinking I had depression and anxiety. Lamictal has worked miracles for me! I can't believe this is how neurotypical people feel day to day. I've been missing out my whole life and wish I took it sooner! I'm productive, I sleep normally, and I experience little to no anxiety or intense moods. Only downfall is I have had some vivid dreams and nightmares but they're definitely not as bad as my mood swings. Not even 100 percent sure they're from the Lamictal. Only reason why I gave it a 9/10 is because I haven't been on it for too long yet (25 MG twice daily)",9,46
Lamictal,"This drug genuinely saved my life. I'm 25 and have exhibited depressive symptoms for the past 10 years, which is way too long to wait to get properly treated. It took getting on Effexor and experiencing mixed-states/rapid-cycling/suicidal thoughts before I was correctly diagnosed with Bipolar II. I started feeling positive effects on  100 mg Lamictal. I have been stable on 200 mg for a year now, and the only side effects I experienced were fatigue and mildly fragmented sleep the week after increasing dosage. One of Lamictal's bonus effects for me was tamping down my anxiety and panic to almost nothing - this and lifting my omnipresent depression have truly been a life-changer. No side effects now and I am the most happy, productive, and fulfilled I have been in a decade!",10,72
Lamictal,I had tried every kind of medication for my bipolar condition and this was the only one that worked well.  I had no bad side effects I took this for1 0 years I highly recommend,10,38
Lamictal,"Lamictal is the best drug Ive ever taken. I had severe low moods for 5 years and they were totally gone at 300 mg.  It took 3 years for me to even hit a depressive low, and that was because of a real life event. I am still eccentric and exercize like a maniac. The drug is not great alone for mania and anxiety. No hair loss, no mental dulling, does not make you tired, ZERO sexual side effects. Take only for bipolar depression, not for problems associated with extreme highs. If you are lucky enough to take this without the extreme side effects that some experience during titration, you are taking the most effective drugs to manage low mood swings. Rarely does a drug have such positive reviews. (Taken for 4 years)",10,53
Lamictal,Has anyone experienced confusion and difficulty with words while on lamictal?? Just started taking it on the 17th of January. I'm very scared of psych meds.,0,38
Lamictal,Be Very Careful! I was given this medication for Bipolar with small increases in dosage because I'm very sensitive to medications. However I did experience a very negative side effect attacking my nervous system. One day as I was typing on my computer after taking this medication my legs felt funny at first and then went numb which landed me on the floor nearly helpless. The only part of my body I could feel were my upper part of body from elbows up! Using my elbows to drag myself to a phone for help. PLEASE be careful when starting this medication! Due to my severe reaction to this medication I filed a report with F D A.,1,29
Lamictal,"I am not bipolar. My doctor prescribed it to me as an extra antidepressant. I never noticed a difference from the beginning to the end, but I started having very very disturbing nightmares. I had one nearly every night. I am not exaggerating. I know its not a known symptom, but I swear it was the Lamictal. I took a two week break from it and the dreams stopped. Once I started it again, the dreams returned. I feel a lot better now that I am no longer taking it.",1,24
Lamictal,"Ten years on antidepressants. Numerous breakdowns with family,  jobs, courses, my wallet and the bottle. Spent the last 2 years going to work only to come home to sleep. Lost my two children. House and car a tip. Drove literally everyone away. Slowly came to the realisation that the world may be better without me. I got diagnosed with bipolar/ bpd rapid cycling and now on day 3 of lamactil. Weaning off effexor. My house is clean, I can prioritize things, I seem to be clawing my way out of that dark space in my mind. I'm motivated to leave the house and am hopeful about cleaning up my financial messes. If I had been diagnosed earlier I might still have my children. This medication is saving my life.",10,92
Lamictal,I have been on Lamotrigine for a month now and so far it has changed my life around. With bipolar 2 I suffered a depressive state for over a month and quit my job because it got so bad. I am taking 100mg right now and I have not experienced any adverse side effects except for sleeping longer than usual with vivid dreams. A couple side effects I would consider positive is that I am not constantly hungry anymore and libido has improved so  lovey dovey with my husband all the time. It has also helped reduce my urge of drinking alcohol. This is the best medicine I have ever been on after doctors were treating me with SSRIs for the past 10 years until a new doctor diagnosed me with bipolar 2. A+++ for Lamotrigine.,10,73
Lamictal,"I was on this medicine for only a month, but I couldn't take it any longer. I had a constant sore throat and nasal congestion, brain fog and more but most difficult to me was how deeply depressed I felt on this medicine and it didn't lift till I quit taking it. I was always crying and I'm not a crier. I had no positive benefits unfortunately. I had high hopes lamictal would help with the low side of bipolar while my lithium helps keep the mania away.",2,24
Lamictal,"Causes an obscene amount of hair loss. Many other people have experienced the same problem. Have tried every vitamin and supplement to stop it but nothing has worked. Really improves my mood, but detrimental to the hair on my head. When I stop taking it, my hair grows back rapidly but my mood plummets. Wish someone would come out with an improved version that does not cause hair loss. Its a big problem.",3,39
Lamictal,I've taken this med on and off since it was approved for BP. It's like day and night when on or off it. Every time I start taking it again I always think why did I ever stop this. I've taken so many drugs over the last 30 years and this is the only one that works.,10,45
Lamictal,"I have only been on lamictal for just under 2 weeks so I can't say I've given up on it yet, but so far this med has done nothing noticeable to help me at all. In fact, every day when I take my 50 mg, exactly 1 hour after I've ingested the pills I feel painfully depressed and lethargic. Also my vision is blurry, I have little clusters of zits all over my face when I usually have pretty good skin. Disappointing but I'm not giving up yet. If it weren't for my lithium, I would have to quit the lamictal because of the severe depression I feel.",3,15
Lamictal,"My bipolar disorder type II was untreated for my whole adult life, and I am now 40 and am treated. I can say without a doubt that this drug has changed my life. I used to be angry at everyone, constantly agitated, hypo-manic and productive or hypomanic and destructive, or, most of the time, severely depressed and full of self-doubt. My life is entirely different, I go through most days feeling absolutely fine in my mind and body. When I don't feel great, I am able to check in on myself and take note of my symptoms, which then dissipate as soon as I comprehend them. My therapist says my pre-frontal lobes have come back and I have my higher functioning back againit's been years since I felt this in touch with my thoughts and desires. Take a note of this: it didn't work hardly at all until I got up to the 200mg dose. In fact, I was almost as bad or worse until then with my cycling, but at 200mg it was like magic.",10,62
Lamictal,"I have been prescribed Lamictal since 2013, and it changed my life. I was incorrectly diagnosed with depression at 18, (I'm 34 now) and the patterns of my mania and lows wasn't recognized till I was 30. After a Psychiatric assessment, I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder, and was prescribed Lamictal, and I feel great. No side effects that really stand out, haven't had major highs or lows, and I feel like I took control back over my life.",9,45
Lamictal,"this drug made me a zombie, numbed my passion, my energy, my empathy, and what makes me myself.  I'll take living a partially-psychotic existence over a dulled/lifeless one.",1,34
Lamictal,Gave me crippling depression pretty much instantly. Would not recommend.,1,20
Lamictal,"I have been taking this drug off and on for BP1 since 2004.  I do not think it has pulled me out of a major depression alone.  However, I do think I have been less depressed during those years I took it.   I took it alone consistently from 2004-2011 and only had about two depressions which were partially circumstantial and were moderate.   I did not become suicidal in either one.  After I went off it in 2011 on the advice of an anti-psychiatry psychiatrist I had suicidal thoughts on several occasions and became moderately depressed at least once a year.  I lacked insight at the time but in retrospect I was missing the protection Lamictal has given me.  I take it with Lithium now and it is a good combo.",7,21
Lamictal,"I put myself into inpatient psych voluntarily. I was so  depressed that I actually heard a man talking out of my sealing fan and next to my table that evening there was a couple talking to each other. Crazy right? I committed myself the next day . Finely after nine months with the VA I had a psychiatrist that talked to me and cared.  He put me on this med to quiet my mind and what blessing. I have had no side affects and tomorrow I increase my dose. I would have sat in yoga practice all day and evening to have this stilled mind. Now I know what other vets go through. Good luck to everyone on their journey, blessings.",10,33
Lamictal,Not so much sharing as a question.  I was recently told I am bipolar 2 and was given lamictal and have been taking it for only a week but absolutely hate how I am feeling.  I feel nonhuman. I can't stay awake. I feel helpless or hopeless not really sure which. Please tell me this gets better or am I beyond help. Do I just live with the ups and downs that I've been living with for almost all of my 48 years...,0,12
Lamictal,Very effective as mood stabilizer I take 200 mg in the morning and 200 mg before bed. Had no side effects. I take it with 1 mg of rivotril klonopin before bed. No depression no mania. For anyone with bipolar disorder try it. Its worth it. Lamictal is much better than zyprexa because zyprexa has many side effects.,9,21
Lamictal,"I was prescribed Lamictal for cyclothymia disorder. Although I have only been on Lamictal for 3 months (200mg), I have noticed a significant change in my sleeping habits. I went from being hypomanic and only sleeping 2-4 hrs a night, to sleeping a normal 8. Lamictal has made me a morning person, something I never thought was possible. It has dampened my depressive episodes considerably, as I no longer have hypersomnia with intense despair. The only side effect I experienced was moderate headaches within the first few weeks. I was skeptical and afraid to try this drug but so far I am very glad that I did.",7,25
Lamictal,"Recently diagnosed with Bi-Polar Disorder II after many years of battling against depression. Used to self-medicate with cannabis regularly but the strength of it induced psychosis, so have been 6 months without it. The  first five months off it were dreadful; hopelessness, poor diet, no exercise, spending all time in bed, not interacting with the world and a downward spiral of self-pity. My Doctor prescribed Lamictal and I was doubtful of its effectiveness. However, I noticed a stabilization in mood after just 3 days of taking 25 mg per day. And after a week, the improvements have increased so that I no longer feel hopelessness with no future. In fact, I feel normal, very normal. My diet has improved and my self-care - washing, cleanliness, etc - has returned. The drug really works and has greatly improved my self confidence and made everything so much easier. I would recommend it anyone suffering depression as it really does work.",9,51
Lamictal,"After my diagnosis, the first trial of medication I was prescribed was Lamictal, and shortly after, Seroquel. Being 18 at the time, I didn't take it seriously enough at the time, so I didn't take my medication as I was supposed to. I went through 8 trials since that time (9 years). Antipsychotics made me gain TONS of weight, so I took myself off all the ones I had been given trials of. Antidepressants made the condition noticeably much, much worse (I don't recommend them for Bipolarpatients). In 2016, I began to take my Bipolar seriously, and 2 years later, I have never been in a better place. It doesn't help every aspect of BP1, but the duration of time between episodes are so much longer, as well as the severity of the mania or depression being much less intense. No negative side effects, either. Regardless of the episodes I inevitably get, this medication saved my life.",9,20
Lamictal,"I have taken Lamictal for well over 10 years for Bipolar Disorder, it's been very effective and helping me keep my moods level, I also take Xanax for anxiety and I also take it if I feel like my moods are starting to fluctuate. I started taking Lamictal when it was a branded medication, I now have been on the generic (Lamotrigine) and it works just as well, I like the Teva generic form of it. It's a diamond shape for the 200mg. I take 200mg 2 times per day for my Bipolar disorder. I hope it keeps working this well for many years. I haven't had any side effects except for cotton mouth, but I try to keep myself as hydrated as possible.",0,29
Lamictal,"I was taking lithium and seroquel to treat bipolar disorder. Lithium seemed to help my  depressive moods  but when Lamictal was added into the mix, it helped even out my manic moods. It works WONDERS for my anxiety!!!! I am so much more calm, levelheaded, and less aggressive on this medication. I would recommend this medication to ANYONE with bipolar (I actually did reccommend to a friend). Seriously a lifesaver!",10,27
Lamictal,"It's been so great and a life-saver for me! Since beginning the medication in 2004, I haven't had any mania. At 100mg once a daily, I don't have any side-effects other than the usual cotton mouth. I tried generic and had one negative side-effect after another, so I switched to name brand and have been fine. Generic and name brand are NOT the same thing.",10,19
Lamictal,"Lamictal has been an extremely effective medication for my bipolar. I took 150mg for 5 years but recently increased to 200mg and found that I benefited from the increase. My moods are even more balanced. Wish I had discovered the need for a slightly higher dose sooner. In addition to lamictal I take 150mg of Wellbutrin daily with an occasional break to prevent a hypocrite manic episode. Also take Seroquel for sleep for some other bipolar symptoms. Lastly, Klonopin for general / social anxiety.",10,15
Lamictal,"After being formally diagnosed with Bipolar II, I tried Saphris, Abilify and Olanzapine before a different Doctor prescribed Lamictal. It is the gold standard in treating BP depression and was instantly effective for me. My depression diminished, my mood elevated, I had little to no side effect; but my hypomania did not seem to be affected. Years later I tried to wean myself off to start a Lithium/Lexapro combo and I immediately crashed. I will definitely stay on lamictal long term to treat Bipolar depression.",10,25
Lamictal,"I have been on lamictal for almost a year, along with a daily dose of wellbutrin  150 XL that I have been with for three years.  Petite and sensitive to medication, I have done well on 50mg lamictal daily. This medication has brought so much RELIEF! Excellent addition to the wellbutrin.  I deal mostly with depression, but also have been very mood sensitive and can be easily sent over the edge. This medication brings me peace and well being.  Having to deal with emotional instability is very stressful and burdensome (for me and those I love).  That burden is lifted, as the range of emotions that I have are much more manageable.  Less worrying if I am going to have an outburst, which means less shame to deal with.  No major symptoms other than very brief, occasional, and mild nausea after I eat.  Overall it has made a huge improvement to my quality of life.  If you are in need of a stabilizer I hope it works for you!",8,30
Lamictal,"Lifesaver! After life long depression and countless other antidepressants, lamictal has allowed me to live a depression free life! Don't have a clue why its so expensive? That is a shame",9,21
Lamictal,"My PDoc prescribed it to me, but I refused to accept that I had mild bipolar (type 2). However, my SSRI  (Cipralex) was only numbing and sometime energizing me for no reason and eventually... led to inevitable depression dips .  I stuck it out for almost 1.5 months on Lamictal only 25 mg's, and trust me, I feel a world of a difference. My life has changed. I feel like I can focus. Although there is MILD emotional numbing, almost stoic, I am able to be present with people and calmly socialize. It is easier to process emotions, which used to be overwhelming before. It allowed my mindfulness and self acceptance practise to skyrocket.  Anyone planning on using this. Titrate slowly!!!!! My symptoms were too much handle when I shot up to 50MG's. I might be different, but please be patient with the drug and move slowly.",9,32
Lamictal,"I have generalized anxiety disorder along with OCD, depression, PTSD &amp; weird/strong/angry mood swings. I am not bipolar but this medication keeps me under control. It helps my anxiety more than anything, I do get random freak out moments where I'll simply just want to go crazy on someone or something. So although I don't know exactly what this medication is helping me with, it's helping me overall be a better person with less (but still rare) mood swings. I'd recommend this med to anyone with any anxiety disorder, etc!",8,23
Lamictal,"I miss me. I'm on 25 mg with Wellbutrin 100, which is a long term drug for me. I'm supposed to increase the lamictal to 50 mg tomorrow and I'm terrified. Yes my moods are more stable. I don't rage at stupid telemarketers, but neither do I find any interest in anything I used to enjoy... no TV, no reading, no online games... I just pace wishing I could feel the joy and passion that I used to gave. So obviously, it works, just too much so for me.",4,11
Lamictal,"I was extremely edgy, Irritable, Depressed, constant thoughts of suicide and extreme fatigue. I was diagnosed with Depression, anxiety and Bi-polar disorder II. I started with 25Mg at night before sleep. Before taking Lamatical my dreams were insane I was constantly running from a person in all my dreams. It would cause distress waking up scared. As soon as I started it my dreams were no longer me running from anything rather just normal things I struggle with in my daily life family friends or issues Im having. I havent had a running dream since! 2 years later I take 300Mg. I am nowhere near perfect but my brain is no longer foggy. I dont cry for no reason at all like I used too. Im just happy I made the decision to seek help. Make sure to keep a positive mind set even with set backs life is a struggle but it takes a clear mind to see the big picture! Last but not least keep your faith",10,37
Lamictal,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 disorder last year. For one year I felt like a guinea pig, taking different medications, increasing &amp; decreasing them. I felt like I would never feel better. My doctor started me on Lamictal after a really bad episode &amp; it worked within two weeks. I am on Lamictal 50 mg a day &amp; zoloft 100mg a day. I feel like a new person. I do not cycle all of the time now &amp; only cry when its actually something sad to cry about &amp; not all of the time. My anxiety is next to nothing anymore. This medication has been a life saver for me. I am so thankful that my doctor placed me on it even though I was ready to give up.",9,25
Lamictal,"On it for 5 years. Mild bipolar (moody). My significant other can tell when I dont take this even a few days. It is a magic drug. I met 3 other women who I found out were on it for bipolar and said this is the one pill they cannot go without. I have been on 100mg for 5 years and it still works the same. Magic! No weight gain. No side effects at all! Just smooth sailing. My drs described it as such,  here is you without lamictal. *holds one palm high and the other low* lamictal will keep you right in the middle. No more ups and downs.  And its done exactly that. I dont think Ill ever go without this med, and there is no reason not to. It works for me, and for tons of others. Miracle drug.",10,30
Lamictal,"I have been treated for what I thought was depression with anxiety since my twenties.  At 60, I finally received a dx on the bipolar spectrum.  Depakote is a dream, but I still had depressive symptoms (strong tendency to isolate). Because of headache, I have had to increase the dose of Lamictal extremely slowly (5mg to start, increasing by 5mg every 2-3 weeks as headaches abate), but it has made me more comfortable doing socially challenging things I want to do. Surprisingly, it also seems to be improving my circadian rhythm so I have been able to get to bed earlier.",9,22
Lamictal,I spent a lot of time getting to a therapeutic dose of this medicine and it never helped me. I felt flat. I was always dizzy to the point I couldn't drive or walk even sometimes. I was never diagnosed bipolar. Anxiety and depression but Dr said this could help me. It was definitely a waste of time and took weeks to come off also.,0,6
Lamictal,"Took this medication for a 2 months. Lamictal did help with depression but it also gave me bad anxiety and anger. When so would get angry, usually for little to no reason at all. It also worsened my vision. As soon as I stopped this med, my vision came back to normal (as close to normal as it was before Lamictal). It also made me really itchy, but that went away once I stopped it too. All of the side effects were very gradual, so I had no idea that they were because of the Lamictal and didnt realize that until after I stopped it and they went away.",2,9
Lamictal,Been on Lamictal for 13+ years and it has been a life saver! I take 600 mg every day along with Seroquel and Wellbutrin and my life is as  normal  as possible.,10,24
Lamictal,Lamictal every morning has completely defeated my depression! Some itching when I first started it but that went away after a few weeks. Also on Seroquel XR at night to control mania. Never been this stable in my life!,9,21
Lamictal,"I was diagnosed Bipolar Disorder I when I was 18 years old, now 25. Since then, I have tried countless medications that have either caused side effects I couldn't handle, or just didn't seem to work for me. I had tried Lamictal early on after I received my diagnosis, but I was a typical teenager refusing to admit I had a problem. Tried multiple antipsychotics, antidepressants (made me extremely manic), and Lamictal has been the only one that has consistently worked. It doesn't cure all, but it does space out my episodes of mania, which are my most common, and depression, and lessens the severity and length. Ideally, I should pair this with an antipsychotic, but until then, Lamictal has made me a better person. So grateful I found Lamictal.",9,21
Lamictal,"I was wrongly diagnosed with major depression, and spent 10 years cycling through various antidepressants that made my symptoms worse before I was prescribed this. Within days I noticed a major difference. I no longer felt chronically fatigued, and could do more than 1-2 big things per day (errands, cleaning, etc...), and was actually excited about being alive. It felt like I had spent years in a fog, but now I'm feeling genuine emotions, and have control over my moods and behavior, which were putting my life and relationships at risk. I'm like a completely different person, and finally feel stable and in control. I'm at the highest dose (300mg) and I am SO happy I found this drug; it's helped make life worth living again.",10,35
Lamictal,"Brought me back to earth from flying around solo in my own world. I can now see how my behavior affects my environment, and I can better control my actions.  Rapid cycling has turned into once a month during full moons. My dishes get washed instead of just thrown away.  Only side effect is vision problems when dose is too high, corrected when lowered. Best medication I have ever taken.",9,23
Lamictal,"I too got the rash, but I stopped it and it went away. Then I started it again but started with a very small dose and worked my way up slowly and never had a problem.",8,19
Lamictal,"This medicine was fantastic - it allowed me to live my life without mood swings and I finally felt like a normal person. I was able to go about my daily routine without getting severely depressed or getting angry at people. Unfortunately this medicine had a very bad side effect for me that made it so I could no longer take it - my private parts were constantly itchy. I went to doctors and they could not tell me anything because they were just as confused as I was, I did not have any infections or anything like that. I traced back the timeline and thought that this medicine was causing it so I decided to stop taking it and sure enough my itchiness went away. This is a great medication but if you have this side effect you are not alone!",8,13
Lamictal,"Lamictal has helped with the extreme highs; now they are at a normal level. But that being said, it has only helped the lows a little bit. The lows are still pretty low, so I wish Lamictal helped a little more with that. But I don't experience any (noticeable) side effects, so that's great. I would definitely recommend this!",8,9
Lamictal,"This was the absolute wrong drug for me. Not sure why my doc put me on this as I don't have a mood disorder I have depression and anxiety. But I got weird side effects like breathlessness, difficulty swallowing and a feeling of not being able to clear my throat - super phlegmy and I can't get it out which actually increased my anxiety. Once I put two and two together I immediately stopped taking those pills. Not the right med for depression and anxiety.",1,10
Lamictal,I was prescribed Lamictil and I did get Steven Johnson disease (a rare and sometimes fatal skin reaction)  and was very ill. Luckily I was treated quickly and am on other medication. Just be aware of the symptom of  Steven Johnson disease and go to ER immediately.,0,18
Lamictal,I was just prescribed this but am freaking out about the chance of getting Steven Johnsons. Has anyone experienced this and did it go away after you stopped taking it? Will I have to worry about this the entire time Im on the medication?,0,13
Lamictal,"I've only been taking this for two weeks but I feel a major difference. I am normally super irritable and moody, I feel like this medication has helped me gain the self control to think before I speak. I also feel like it's relieved me of anxiety, when a situation happens I feel so chill. I also am no longer suffering from extreme depression fatigue, I never had energy to help out around the house and I am able to do dishes, laundry etc.",10,46
Lamictal,This medication made me head into a bad downer and I was  agitated. When I titrated up to 50mg twice a day I had several agitated and had suicidal episodes which were worse than anything I've had in my life. When I discontinued it I started becoming manic. I then ended up in the hospital. I'm going back to only using Rexulti after this at a higher dose.,1,5
Lamictal,"I have struggled with severe anxiety and major depression for 30 years. I have been on MANY different anxiety meds and anti depressants. The only 2 meds that helped slightly were  Paxil and Ativan for panic/anxiety. I was diagnosed with Bipolar about 5 years ago and once again tried other meds. I heard about Lamictal helping other people, so my doctor said we could try it. It has been a LIFESAVER!! I still take Paxil and Ativan, but after the first few days of taking Lamictal, it helped tremendously with my mood swings. But most important, it improved my anxiety by at least 75% if not more. It has been a Godsend for me. I take 100mg a day. Thanks.",10,42
Lamictal,"I was diagnosed Bipolar II back in January after an episode at work. My psychiatrist prescribed lamictal 25mg. I slowly titrated up and am now at 100mg. I was nervous to take it after reading some scary reviews, but it's been a lifesaver for me! I'm finally feeling normal. I have a lot more stability with my moods. It's even made my moods less intense and not as long lasting. It's also somehow helped me with anxiety. Finally my moods aren't effecting my work or relationships. And I've had zero side effects. I love lamictal so so much.",10,40
Lamictal,"I felt compelled to compose this review as I have been through 33 years of HELL. Like many of you I was labelled as just depressed or anxious - nothing worked, CBT went over my head, SSRIs were ineffective etc. I went on second line SNRI treatment and all hell broke loose! Cycling within minutes literally wanting to tear my own limbs off from frustration then the next minute obsessing over meaningless rubbish. I had had enough of the NHS and my job was on hold having been off a considerable amount of time. I decided to get a private psychiatrist and it was the best money I ever spent. I fit the bipolar 2 spectrum to a millimetre of its criteria - now I knew that I wasn't insane. Lamictal has saved me from suicide literally!",10,80
Lamictal,"This is NOT an advertisement: Lamictal changed my life -for the better.  After 7 days, it seemed like a miracle, I slowly began to become focused and feel at peace. Lamictal erased all suicidal thoughts. This is really how I experienced it. It speaks for itself. I never acquired any side effects at all. My short and long term memory is increased. My learning capabilities are in fact better now then ever before. I only wish that I had received the meds years earlier. I made a lot of wrong decisions and choices before it, and still have to live with a lot of  the damaging consequences, of which I am still trying to make amends. Without Lamictal, I wouldn't be alive today, and that is the truth",10,74
Lamictal,"I'm taking Lamictal for bipolar type 2. I have been mentally ill for years and only started getting help recently. I've tried Prozac, Wellbutrin, zoloft within the last year and none worked. I started taking Lamictal about 4 months ago and have been on the dose of 300mg a day for about 2 1/2 months. It has made me feel much more stable, not perfect But much more stable. My stable mood is depressed, so I still am adding an anti-depressant to my list of medications. I'm 25 years old.",8,35
Lamictal,"The way lamictal works faster or slow is due to your metabolism. I could go up doses very fast without having the rash but wow I suffered so much while going through this process. It does get worse before it gets better. Once you get to the therapeutic dose then things start to improve. Now; some of us have vivid dreams. Scary sometimes but you get used to them. Also it took me at least 5 months until I got its full benefit. And it may cause you insomnia, need some ambien for that. Ambien stopped working after 5 months. And so when I tried melatonin it worked pretty well. Melatonin didn't work in the first months on this Drug. Only worked after the 5 months and then after few 2 months I didn't need it anymore. I was sleeping well without it.",10,37
Lamictal,"I've been living with extreme anxiety, quick temp and agitate easily to the point of isolating myself. At 64, my podcast found my fix and diagnosed me as bipolar. I feel like a new person!",10,21
Lamictal,"I don't know where I'd be without it! I've been on it since 2004 and take name-brand only because generic versions of meds and I don't get along. Anyway I haven't had one negative side effect from it in all these years, and will continue to take it as long as I possibly can.  It was within a month of initial use that I saw marked improvement.  When I took the generic (Lamotrigine), I experienced the opposite: It did absolutely NOTHING, so I had to get pre-authorization from my Part D provider through Medicare to be able to take name brand but it's been well worth it.",0,37
Lamictal,"I started Lamictal at 25 mg and was instructed to titrate up to 100 mg.  As soon as I got to 50mg, I got the rash. I was told to go back down to 25 instead of stopping completely. 2 weeks later I had a stiff neck, sore throat, burning eyes, mouth sores, red purple rash came back worse than before.  I was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. The most painful thing I've ever been through! I am still recovering after being discharged from the hospital a week ago.",1,31
Lamictal,"Lamictal had done wonders for me. It took a while for me to get up to a therapeutic dose, but it's helped with my bipolar depression so much, with no side effects. My only complaint is that you have to build up the doses, starting with 25 mg, and going up from there. I'm currently on 200 mg and still going up!",9,28
Lamictal,I have been on so many drugs I lost count and cannot remember all the names. Lamictal has really improved my life. My mood swings have diminished and my depressive episodes have nearly gone away. I have a couple of year now and they don't last nearly as long. I also don't get suicidal anymore. So much gratitude for this medication. I'm on 100 mg right now and when I had my last depressive episode my doctor wanted me to increase my dose but it has a tendency to make me feel out of it and unable to experience any range of emotion really. I just try to make it through the depressive episodes instead.,8,26
Lamictal,"I change to lactimal due to being manic bipolar. This medication changed my life. I am able to feel like myself with stability. I was taking Lithium it made me sick, depressed, drowsy. It calmed my racing thoughts. Not feeling manic all the time. Or depressed like I use to be.",0,19
Lamictal,I had gone through a wide variety of SSRI's before my doctor recommended these. This medication has seriously changed my life and I feel like I have more control about how certain things make me feel.  I am Bipolar 2 taking 200mg and I don't ever want to get back to the state I was in before. Having tried around 5 different types of medication I have finally found the one.,9,42
Lamictal,I still have minor anxiety and depression...but wow my life got changed,8,29
Lamictal,"I have Bipolar II and lamotrigine saved my life. I have taken 200mg for approximately 5 years. In combination with therapy my mood swings have diminished by &gt;95%. My quality of life has skyrocketed. My life truly is broken into 2 segments - before lamotrigine and after lamotrigine. My memory is certainly a bit worse, but I notice no other side effects. The memory impairment is not substantial enough to warrant stopping the medication.",10,33
Lamictal,"I'm bipolar II and this med works very well. The depression still comes and goes and I do feel kinda crappy somewhat often, but it is definitely not horrible and incapacitating like it was before. Also Lamictal has reduced my hypomania probably by half, and makes it barely noticeable unless I am trying to sleep. A huge plus is that I've had ZERO side effects of any kind (other than temporary ones when increasing doses), which is very rare for antidepressants and anti-mania drugs.

Lamictal,"I started on Lamictal after having manic episodes on Zoloft as well as Wellbutrin. I was a heavy cigarette and marijuana smoker. In the first couple weeks of starting Lamictal, I was able to quit smoking weed and cigarettes!! I didn't have insomnia as I previously did when trying to quit marijuana. My mood was much improve. I had been suicidal before and I started exercising again on Lamictal. I developed an unknown rash about 2 years into Lamictal and stopped immediately. The rash disappeared. It looked like 8 mosquito bites all over my legs. I was forced to try Abilify which made me gain over 40 pounds and take naps during the day. Today, I have started back on Lamictal and am back on track with exercising and enjoying life.",10,49
Lamictal,"I have bipolar 2, BPD, anxiety, and PTSD from past trauma. I have taken many drugs over the years, including  SSRI's and lithium carbonate. No medication has help with my anxiety, depression, and mood swings anywhere near as effectively as Lamictal. Within 2 weeks I felt like myself again. I felt like a weight had been lifted. My appetite and sleep patterns also became more normalised. I am on 100mg twice a day. And have been for about 6 months. I was ready to give up on medications, then I was but on Lamictal. It was like night and day. It's hard to describe, honestly. But I feel much for content and happier in general. The only side effect I can remember is when I missed a dose, I got very aggravated and moody. Much love!",9,53
Lamictal,"I've been on this medication for 1 year or even 2 years with 300 mg. I still have extreme mood swings and it doesn't help at all, I want lithium or other bipolar medicine - this doesn't work at all for me.  I'm really scared to gain weight while on some other medication because I already gained 20 kg from an antipsychotic medicine before but I can live with this. My bipolar illness gets worse and worse I still have a good medicine base tho. It's not as extreme as a couple of years ago but I'm only 19 years old so I'm looking forward trying something else.",4,11
Lamictal,"I just started lamictal, after tapering off of topamax. Topamax did nothing for me. I have disorder 2 in which I am more manic. I've been on it 3 weeks and so far I have been episode free, which is good for me considering I am a rapid cycler. I've done a lot of research on lamictal and it appears to meet my needs the most. And it's weight neutral. (Topamax never made me lose wight either). Also it doesn't halt your emotions like say lithium, where you are neither nor sad you're just emotionless. I hate that. Lamictal was a great choice for me so far so good!",8,27
Lamictal,In 3 days of use I had itchy scalp within 2 weeks I had to be taken off due to itchy rash on neck and face as it was getting worse. It has been 2 weeks on new medication and I am still having the breakout.,1,14
Lamictal,"Lamictal has been a game changer for me. I have been through the complete bipolar medication gauntlet. I now take 300 mg a day along with 200mg  wellbutin, 20 mg of Adderall and hydroxyzine to sleep. I was able to stop taking Xanax because of this awesome drug!! I have had this same regimen for a year and a half. Before this I was about to give up all hope on medicines. Please keep in mind  no medicine will never fix your Bipolar Disorder. As far as side effects I have had significant hair loss. I think that started with other medicines though. I have also had EXTREMELY intense dreams. That's something I'm still getting use to.",9,23
Lamictal,I have bipolar 1 disoder. I am on abilify (currently getting off) and Lamictal. Lamictal has helped me level a lot alot. Been a good medicine for me only side effect I noticed is I started yawning alot after taking it.,9,18
Lamictal,"After many trials and error, I found that 200mg at bedtime is the best for me. I ran out of refills about 4 months ago and had to go without for another month before I could see a Dr. I know that's not safe but I had no choice. My family as well as myself could notice the difference in my mood swings within a week!",8,16
Lamictal,"Lamictal has been a life saver. Started when I was 18, after 4 years of unsuccessful treatment plus 2-3 years of emotional instability not treated. Started lamictal and I finally felt like the person I was always supposed to grow up to be. I do get the morning woozies when I increase the dose for worsening symptoms, but I have been more or less in remission. Very minimal side effects, and generally effective as stand alone maintenance drug.",9,36
Lamictal,"This drug gave me brain damage and I almost failed out of college.  I was a ballerina, but after this medication I couldn't keep balance anymore and couldn't dance.  This drug actually ruined my life and it has taking several years for me to recover from the damage it caused me mentally and physically.",0,43
Lamictal,I don't think this works.,4,7
Lamictal,"I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar, but my psychiatrist put me on this over a year ago for a mood disorder. She built me up to 200 mgs and about a year ago moved me to 150 mgs in the morning and another 150 mgs at night. It's not a miracle pill and I still feel down sometimes and happy at others, but overall I don't get super down like I used to. In conjunction with the other psychiatric medicine I am on, it helps to keep me stable and helps me deal with a very serious disease that I came down with about 3 years ago that has completely turned my world upside down.",9,25
Lamictal,"So, I feel like this did help stabilize me a little bit (with depressive states), but I ended up getting acne and redness all over my face. I also had my eyes feel all weird and twitchy. Overall, It was not super effective for me because I still had horrible anxiety and panic attacks and I could not titrate high enough to get effective coverage from the medication without weird side effects. I was only on 75mg maximum, mind you.",5,21
Lamictal,"I've been on Lamictal for around 4-5 months. After my bipolar depression returned and wasn't being kept under control by my Seroquel and Prozac I did some research and saw Lamictal had decent reviews. My doctor started me on the medication and within a week I began to feel more energized, and happier. That was at 100 mg. I now believe the depression is coming back and I have been upped to 200 mg, along with 40mg of Prozac. The drug has done great things for me so far.",9,36
Lamictal,"Lamictal handles most of my symptoms, but I continue to deal with money issues and relationships.",9,30
Lamictal,This drug has been a lifesaver so far.  Especially considering the other less-than-ideal medication options for bipolar disorder.,10,22
Lamictal,"It really does work amazingly! I am bipolar II. was originally diagnosed as having major depressive disorder, but my depression did fluctuate in intensity quite a bit, so my psychiatrist thought Lamictal could work and that I could bipolar. So I started Lamictal (ironically right before I started the Lamictal I started having hypomania and was then properly diagnosed as bipolar II) For weeks it really did not help much - and then I reached the full dose of 200mg. I've been on this dose for a month and have felt completely normal or virtually normal most of the time! The medication isn't perfect though, as the depression ocassionally comes on rather hard, but even when it does it is temporary and NOWHERE near as bad as it was before.",9,40
Lamictal,"I've recently started taking lamictal (50 mg) about three days ago for bipolar disorder along with lithium (600 mg) which was originally 900 mg but I found it to be too sedating so my doc lowered it back to 600 and I can honestly say I feel a major difference I feel like my mood is stabilizing and I'm starting to feel happy again and simply normal not too high with unorganized thinking and behavior or a rushed mind with all kinds of racing thoughts or mixed and depressive episodes when I've just felt as if I was in a roller coaster ride with my mood going up and down, and the depressive phase when I didn't care about anything and didn't even want to move and felt hopeless to anyone suffering don't give up and give lamictal a try",0,43
Lamictal,Lamictal has changed my life. I'm a diagnosed bipolar 1 and have had friends and family notice massive changes in my personality. I never knew life could be so happy and easy.,10,46
Lamictal,"I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 recently at 34 years old. I'm also diagnosed with severe depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and PTSD.  After being on what seems every antidepressant in the world, finally, a combination of Lamictal, Wellbutrin, and Xanax has been a life saver.I was prescribed the Lamictal a couple months ago. I noticed that after a couple weeks the Lamictal started to wear off a little and the depression started to appear again. I was started on 25 mg and then upped to 50 mg. A few days ago I noticed the depression again. I'm going to ask my Dr. to up my dose again. Sorry for the long response lol. I just wanted to let anyone else know that I'm going through a similar experience.",9,43
Lamictal,I was diagnosed bipolar a year ago and started at 100 then 150 and now 200mg at night in conjunction with Cymbalta 30 mg. I have had no side effects and I really think this drug has saved my life.,9,46
Lamictal,"Lamictal saved my life. I have struggled my whole life with rapid cycling bipolar 2, with more frequent and longer lasting depressive episodes than manic. I was just recently diagnosed and never knew what was wrong with me- I've been dealing with this since as early I can remember , around age 10. I started seeing a counsellor and psychiatrist and this is the conclusion they came to. When I started going I was so close to ending my life, it was terrifying . I just thought it was normal. Then my psychiatrist started me on Lamictal and we worked up to 200 mg and I have never been this happy in my ENTIRE LIFE . I've been overweight forever and I'm now losing a lot of weight healthily, I'm so happy and confident and I'm finally making changes.",10,120
Lamictal,I was put on lamictal about 9 Years ago.. Tried everything else nothing worked.. I have bipolar..severe panic attacks and agoraphobia.. I was in horrible condition... Started at lowest dose and stayed at 300mg ...fine until about 8 months ago and got scerlitis of eye.. Went to eye doctor treated with steroids... But it just coming back... Finally realized it must be my medication.. Quit lamictal and it was gone.. When I saw my doctor I told her and she said yes that is a side affect and I could never take again.. OMG.. Best med ever for bipolar.. Some anxiety break thrus..but 1st time I ever really felt normal.. After this got another Dr put me on Paxil.. OMG.. What a nightmare.. I bottomed out.. Ground zero... Now on nothing for 3 weeks..,8,30
Lamictal,"Diagnosed with Bipolar twenty two years ago. Treated initially with lithium and Carbamazepine. I stopped taking everything and existed for years. Extremely bad depression last fall which left me a total shell without memory, emotion, feeling.  I am now starting on lamictal as it is time for me to live again rather than exist. Thank you all for your feedback. I am actually looking forward to starting this drug and will keep you updated x",5,39
Lamictal,"I am bipolar 2 and take 300mg per day. Has changed my life so much. Helped me kick my alcohol addiction and impulsiveness. The last two years have been great. No drug is perfect however, and the withdrawals can be bad. Make sure you take it every day. So I gave it an 8 because I feel great if I keep up with it. I take it right after I wake up because it helps wake me up and gives me energy. Also makes me very patient with myself, other people and just life in general throughout the day. At my current dosage I wouldn't hesitate to call it a smart drug for me because it lessons my impulsive tendencies and quickness to anger. If this doesn't work for you, don't fret, I study medicine, and there is usually always something available to help.",8,73
Lamictal,"I haven't found the perfect medication, but this is among the best so far. What is nice is that is also indicated for pain and helps my severe pain condition by reducing neuropathic pain.",9,43
Lamictal,I've been taking 200 mg. Lamictil for the last 2.5 months in combo with 60 mg. Cymbalta. I feel much less manic than before Lamictil but feel Cymbalta is too activating  &amp; makes me manic. Seeing my shrink soon to sort it out.,8,15
Lamictal,For me the side effects greatly outweighed the benefits since I didn't feel any benefits. This medicine might be effective for the treatment of something. However bi-polar/depression not so much. Not a whole lot of fun when you stop taking it either.,1,16
Lamictal,"I've used Lamictal for several years and I feel that it is a very effective drug with little to no side effects.  Moods are quite stable; although I still do get some depression.  Overall, I've been extremely stable for the past 3 years taking it with a combination of Lexapro for depression.",9,30
Lamictal,"This medication completely turned my life around. For 2 years I've been going through countless of antidepressant cocktails without much luck (one of them was Effexor and Mirtazapine which apparently is one of the most effective combos)  It was until a few months ago when I demanded being evaluated for bipolar disorder, and after a few tests they put me on Lamictal (in combination with Wellbutrin, Prozac and Mirtazapine) the first titration weeks was hell, my mood was all over the place. But early February everything did a 180 and now I'm finally able to live a normal adult life",10,36
Lamictal,"I was on 400 mgs for six years. In that time it messed with my testosterone. My doctor never said anything about it. Still suffered from manic depression, depression anxiety.",2,12
Lamictal,"I wanted to add to my review. Besides developing a very bad rash &amp; chest pains, sometimes Lamictal would give me heartburn &amp; indigestion too. It would last for hours &amp; I would be very nauseated. I never had heartburn or indigestion before, so I know it was the medicine that caused it. I'm so glad I don't take it anymore.",1,12
Lamictal,"I've had a few unpleasant side effects. I feel truly blessed with this medication. I had bipolar 2 and  other more common medications were not an option for my mood disorder.  It keeps me so much more stable. I took a lot of drugs before and was suicidal. I was able to get off drugs and stopped my suicidal urges. I had grown unfaithful with psychiatry.  I was sure that this medicine would not work like every other thing but it helped me so much.  There are so many positive effects. Prevents suicidal urges, lessen depression, relaxes my body, helped me take lower doses of Xanax, helps anxiety, helps sleep, Happy sometimes Cons - It effects my memory bad and I've lost a lot of hair. I'm a girl and my hair is really thinning out. :/",10,43
Lamictal,"Lamictal is a great medication. The titration takes quite a while, but it's worth it -- honestly. It isn't too effective at controlling the hypo or full blown mania -- as something like Geodon -- but it's a crown jewel for depression, especially treatment resistant depression. In terms of side effects there are few to none for most people. What I got was some mild dizziness and photosensitivity/blurred vision (a little irritating but nothing serious). In combo with Zoloft this was the power cocktail I was on for years.",9,32
Lamictal,"I started at 25 mg of Lamictal. After 2 weeks my doctor increased it to 50 mg. 2 weeks after increasing my med I noticed a minor skin rash on my chest one night. I overlooked it &amp; continued taking the Lamictal. When my doctor increased it to 100 mg that is when I started having a bad reaction. That night I broke out in a bad rash on my chest, stomach &amp; left arm (not my right arm). I also started having bad chest pains. I called my doctors office the next day &amp; the nurse told me to stop taking the Lamictal &amp; go to the hospital. I'm stubborn, so I refused to go. My chest pains had gone away &amp; the rash was clearing up, so I wasn't as worried about it as I was the night before. I decided to go to the EmergiCare instead &amp; I turned out to be OK",1,22
Lamictal,"I'm bipolar and I guess for a year or two I was trying to stabilize my mood with pain killers (I've had cervical spine surgery and lung surgery so have access). When I started taking Lamictal it seemed like my pain subsided and I was able to easily quit using my medication. Also haven't felt a need to drink alcohol. Feel very stable and seems like my interests are coming back. I've taken lamictal before for a couple years and don't remember why I got off. First time I took it I got a rash but it went away. This time have not experienced a rash. Taking 200mg morning 200mg night. Seems to be a perfect dose for me. So much easier with my business, wife, and kids. They didn't deserve my mood swings.",9,43
Lamictal,"I moved from quetiapine to lamictal about six weeks ago. I have stopped itching as badly now, and feel quite good. Currently taking 200mgs. I am having trouble sleeping,  Here in England Dr doesn't prescribe  sleeping pills. I'm very tired in the morning as a result and early evening, then come alive! I feel things better, my anger and irritation has subsided. I have lost a stone in weight in last 8 weeks.. this has helped, so feel more positive. I wish I could relax though.",8,29
Lamictal,"It was fantastic when I started taking it, I finally felt myself after 3 years of feeling possessed or going crazy...after 3 years of taking it I started to have cysts behind my ears, in my face, especially in the chin, and when I realized it was lamictal that was causing it I stopped it. I still have cysts, I was told it's an allergic reaction on my skin to the drug. Now, after 2 years not taking it the cysts are appearing still but not as fast or defacing as it was. I read on forums the condition could never cure, but I am seeing good progress on my skin. It was a nightmare, it even gave me cysts on my scrotum. The body is slowly expelling them, but very slowly. I also have 3 cysts on my left nipple and I think those will need surgery.",5,20
Lamictal,"Our 16 year old son was diagnosed with Bipolar and placed on many medicines that made him worse. Once he started on Lamictal, he is making wonderful progress, having clearer thinking and more stable moods. He stated that the medicine is really helping him. He has been on this medicine for several months at a low dosage and we are seeing our son come back!",10,48
Lamictal,"Well, I don't know if I'm the only one on here but this did not work very well for me. My skin started being much more red (especially in my face). Under my eyes looked sickly. I had a harder time falling asleep.  I even began to have ocular problems. I still was having panic attacks and severe depression--I suppose I was less manic though?",2,17
Lamictal,"Lamotrigine was the first medication I was prescribed after being diagnosed with bipolar II at 32 years old. Almost immediately, I felt more even. As I was titrated from 25 mg to 250 mg over a few months, I was lifted out of a severe, crippling depression. Lamotrigine is my %u201Cpep%u201D drug because it works for me as an antidepressant.  I did go manic on it a couple times when the medication dosage was increased and had to go on a second medication (Neurontin) to %u201Cbring me down.%u201D But the two meds together work to even me out.  Overall, I think this is a great medication. I%u2019ve had no major side effects except severe insomnia but the second medication   sleeping medication help manage that.",9,21
Lamictal,"Hi all, I left my opinion last year around October. And things have changed just a bit. I understood my illness is genetic Bc my uncle had it and my dad has it but don't accept it I guess. Anyway 70% of cases have a genetic background so feel better about that. You didn't chose this. I feel Lamictal is not working as well after two years but not a major change. I will increase it from 200mg to 250 this week. I control my depression with clonazepan. I feel anxiety makes depression worse. So when it kicks in then I feel stronger enough to make a prayer and it goes away.we need to do some work in our brain. Everything that is negative you change it for yes and I can and I will.",9,37
Lamictal,"I have been on generic lamictal for nearly 2 months, on 300 mg for 1 week so far. I feel great when I wake up, depressed late am and afternoon, then decent in the evenings. Has anyone else had this with lamictal? My hope is that a higher dosage will do the trick. Thanks for any responses!",7,19
Lamictal,"Not the most effective. It did tone down my hypomania a little bit. I normally get depressive episodes at a set time every year, and lamotrigine pushed it a bit later than it would have been. Besides that, it didn't do much; I'm still having severe depressive episodes that lead to suicidality. No side effects on its own, but I've noticed that it seems to magnify the side effects of other drugs if I take both (e.g., if I take a drug that makes me drowsy, lamotrigine makes me more drowsy; if I take a drug that makes me nauseous, lamotrigine makes me more nauseous, etc.). All in all I'm pretty neutral on this drug. It's not great, but not bad.",5,16
Lamictal,"I am a 31 year old female. I was prescribed Lamictal by my psychiatrist after describing my terrible mood swings. I was easily annoyed, agitated, and irritable. I would go from super happy and laughing to crying and screaming at the drop of a hat. I tried so hard to control it, but I couldn't. This medication has leveled me out so much. I feel much more normal. I'm currently taking 50 mg twice a day. After about a month, I do notice my symptoms start to return. I tell my psychiatrist, and he ups my dose. I'm hoping I'll eventually reach a dosage that'll stick. I still have some anxiety (especially social anxiety), but this medication has helped me so much. It has really improved my personal relationships.",9,58
Lamictal,"I wanted to take some time out of my day in case someone is struggling and I may help them have the hope and courage to take the leap and get better. I have bipolar spectrum ADHD. I have never had a manic episode, but I get pretty irritable, hyper, and feel like I'm crawling out of my skin sometimes. I have some mood swings and have had some impulsive behavior that I am not proud of. I was always very ashamed of this and was lucky that I could contain it by really white-knuckling through life. I eventually was exhausted by this and tried this medicine at the suggestion of a wonderful psychiatrist, who I am willing to recommend. Within a month I was a different person. I am calmer, steadier, and found contentment. Please get help :).",10,96
Lamictal,"I've seen a psychiatrist and a therapist for year. Over a 12 year span, I've probably tried 20-30 drugs. This medication is the first to make me feel human again. I'm not a zombie and I'm not lacking emotion. I'm genuinely happy and thriving. I'm so happy I finally found this medication. I've also not had weight gain, I've actually lost some weight.",10,69
Lamictal,Great. I have been on it for ten years. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 at 25 y/o and it took me about 1.5 yrs before a psychiatrist recommend this. They also had me on depakote which can cause liver damage. Later I removed the depakote. When life continued became more stressful (getting my master's and starting a family) I  had anxiety start and begun Paxil. I am now trying to stop paxil.,10,17
Lamictal,"At first I was hesitant because of the price w/o ins (over $100 a bottle) and some people can develop a serious rash. However, after some contemplation, and knowing that the lithium I was taking was not helping my bi-polar depression, and knowing Lamictal helps increase energy, I decided to take it anyway... I LOVE THIS STUFF. Its helped me so much, I've gone off lithium and am taking it exclusively for BP2. I'm on a low dose of 50 mg because I experienced some itching at first, which did go away after about a month. Now, I have NO side effects, and my depression is GONE without me feeling numb. In other words, I can still be sad without spinning into depression. I haven't gone manic either, but I rarely go that way, so it works for me!",8,49
Lamictal,I have been on 400 mg of lamictal for 12 years. My life went from a nightmare of being diagnosed with major clinical depression and anxiety disorder with racing thoughts to a normal life. I tried more antidepressants and combinations than I can count in the 3 years leading up to my rapid cycling bp2 diagnosis. I have minor hypomanic episodes a few times a year and only a few depressive episodes in the last 12 years. No side effects. Tonight I start Teva manufacturer generic. New insurance won't cover brand ($1100/mth) So scared if it will work. Doc says I'll know within 2 weeks.  Had a baseline blood draw so I can compare my levels on brand vs. Generic.,10,30
Lamictal,My experience with lamictal is different for me in most cases. I used to take 25mg of lamictal. When I had taken the meds everyday I didn't feel any different from when I wasn't taking them. I had no side effects it was like taking air. So I kept having suicidal thoughts &amp; being angry at 8am &amp; by 8:30 am i was happy. I just had different moods every 30 mins. So i talked to my doctor and told her the meds werent working i told her how i was feeling so she gave me 100mg. Ever since then i have had no feeling what so ever. Like I can choose what to care about &amp; what not to care about. I'll be fine all day and by 8-9 o'clock pm all of my bipolar &amp; depression hits me like a wave of sadness that I feel like I'm drowning in. I guess its worth it..,7,25
Lamictal,"I am very pleased with the results of taking Lamictal for my BP2. It definitely stabilized my moods. I felt better within weeks of starting this drug. I take a high dose (400 mg) without side effects. My irritability has been reduced and I no longer have to hide myself, as my depression has been lifted. I take Paxil for my anxiety issues. I recommend therapy to go along with the medication, as awareness can be an important part of treatment.",10,47
Lamictal,"This drug has given me my life back. I am now emotionally balanced, it has given me back the sparkle in my eye (says my wife), I can focus and I am dealing with things I was afraid to before due to BP anxiety. I was a complete MESS before lamictal, hardly able to take care of myself and had lost interest in all activities and v emotional depressed/antzy/angry despite being on lithium 1000, seroquel 100mg mirtazapine 25mg. On lamictal my brain just calmed the heck down. I feel normal, reasonable and have the energy and ability to DO things again. No side effects noticed on lamictal. Hope to stay on this drug for years to come. On a side note some BP groups on FB are really helpful and supportive and friendly. You are not alone with BP.",10,82
Lamictal,I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2 and been on lamictal for several years. The Doc. Had me up to 150 mg it made me manic so my dose was to 50 mg  i tolerated 50 mg  the drug did nothing for OCD   I only had minor depression before the drug. The doc thought that Lamictal would control my mania and OCD but it doesn't  The small dose did take stop my eye twitch so I'm staying with it.,1,14
Lamictal,"so Lamictal takes a while to work...in my case it was about 6 months to reach is maximum effect.I am on 200 mg. if I go higher it is a total nightmare. be careful it depends on the person how much you can take. if you feel you are going more depressed go to the dose you were before and take clonazepan as needed but not everyday. lamictal affected my sleep I had to take ambien but after 6 months I started taking melatonin and it worked. I wanted to say that it is important is family support and when that is non existent then in my case, i grabbed a Bible and prayed a lot even until today. psalm 91 and Ephesians 6:10, also Psalm 23. it gets in a point when you have to fight your brain. doctors and medication helps until certain point.",8,73
Lamictal,"I was only on this drug for a month ramping up to 50mg before I developed a rash that spread all over my body including swelling, 104° fever's, chills and night sweats.   I was hospitalized for two weeks and put on 80 mg of prednisone to try to control it until my body wouldn't metabolize that amount and then I was put on methylprednisone. The rash took two months to go away only after bouts of severe itching, bumps, burning and sloughing of skin from everywhere on my body for weeks. I had to take colloidal oatmeal baths with oil several times a day just to remotely tolerate it.   Unfortunately I am one of the rare cases that has a severe life-threatening reaction to it called D. R. E. S. S. Syndrome. Careful!",0,46
Lamictal,"For years I never understood how I could stay in bed for 7 +days. Then when diagnosed, and I started taking lamitical it changed my life. I do have some symptoms, I can stay in bed for 2 days. That is progress for me.",9,41
Lamictal,I am 27 and was diagnosed with Major Depression 7 years ago. I was on Fluoxetine which helped somehow but with emotional flatness &amp; low motivation side effect. I also used Paxil when depression strikes again 2 years later but it made my depression worse so i went back on fluxetine. One year ago i felt going depressed again and my doctor put me on Zoloft but i started rapid cycling so i was diagnosed with BP2 and started Lamictal 150mg. I feel really good &amp; normal with it. I never felt like that before. Now i also use 10mg Lexapro which helps me with depression. The great miracle for me was Lamictal not SSRIs ! It surely helps for BP2 to feel normal and happy without any sedation or annoying side effects.,9,56
Lamictal,"I started taking lamictal for my unspecified bipolar disorder a few weeks ago. The results have been remarkable, I could feel the medication start work a few hours after the first dose and it was definitely more than just a placebo effect. I was less flighty and everything just seemed brighter and clearer. My thinking has cleared up and my mood is well controlled even while traveling, which is when hypomania usually sets in for me.",9,44
Lamictal,"My daughter took lamictal for bipolar 1 condition.  She titrated up as instructed by her psychiatrist. After 3 weeks, her eyes became irritated, she developed white sores inside her mouth, followed by a life threatening rash that put her in the hospital for 3 weeks. It was touch and go for 2 weeks. She was diagnosed with SJS that turned to TEN. Amniotic membrane was surgically placed into her eyes for protection and she was unable to see for 6 weeks.

Lamictal,"This drug is a god send I suffered from bipolar since I was 17 im now 21 I have mixed episode that last for 6 month or more. I tried evey single medicine and I mean every thing antidepressant make me worse I have panic attack, fears ,alot of tears, a lot of depression, obsessive songs in my head lol and nothing seems to work like this one. I left all other drugs (not cold turkey ) , and started it and within 2 weeks I got normal - no panic, no depression and of course no hypomanic no side effect at all , this drug saved I'm more stable focused try it if you are bipolar 2 its a game changer",10,66
Lamictal,This medicine is a godsend. I literally felt like it grew me up. it helps so much with bi polar disorder!  I used to walk down the street and wonder what passing cars thought about me and wondered if they thought I walked silly. Weird but true. After a month on this medication my life changed. I was more focused my mood swings were not so sever if any at all (I used to have mood swings that would last four and sometimes six months at a time).  This medicine changed my life and I feel as though the effects were life changing! Even when I stopped taking the medication I still felt the affects from how I felt. I do not recommend stopping taking the medication though as the mood swings will gradually find their way back into your life.  I,10,63
Lamictal,"This medicine probably saved my life. After being misdiagnosed with severe depression, I had been on a high dose of Prozac which led me to a near suicide attempt. Switching psychologists, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, taken off of the Prozac and put on this medication and almost immediately noticed a difference. They told me that I shouldn't feel a difference until at least 150mgs but I felt it at 75mgs. I'm currently on 400mgs which is usually the highest for treating bipolar. It is also used to treat epilepsy, and people with epilepsy take thousands of mgs a day, so it I felt safer when experimenting with it. The only reason I gave it a 9 is that it doesn't completely hold me over when I have overwhelming emotions. Adding Trileptal now.",9,52
Lamictal,"Lamictal worked like a charm on my mood. I so pleasantly surprised and relieved! I've tried something like 10 medications in an 11-year period and it's been the only thing that's worked. However, it gave me really bad back acne (like, whoa) and made me very physically ill- super swollen lymph nodes in my neck, fever, vomiting &amp; fatigue, etc. I had to stop taking it, but I'd say it's definitely worth a try. In general I'm very susceptible to side effects. I have hypomania, depression, anxiety, ADHD, my mood is super unstable, and Lamictal was prescribed to me because my doctor wanted to stabilize my mood before putting me on a stimulant since stimulants by themselves make me way too hyper.",7,28
Lamictal,I was misdiagnosed for several years by numerous doctors who all kept throwing drugs upon drugs to deal with one symptom after another. I finally found my current psychiatrist who properly diagnosed me at that time with BP2. I started on Lamictal then and as the years have progressed and episodes have happened and my diagnosed changed to BP1 my dosage changed. I've been taking 600 mg for years and have had no side effects at all. To keep my mania at bay I take 600 mg of seroquel daily and then 300 mg of Wellbutrin to keep depression leveled out. I have to take 400 mg of Lamictal in the morning and then the other 200 mg at night before bed. That seems to keep a even range in my body.,10,44
Lamictal,"Caused a rash, so discontinued use.",5,21
Lamictal,"This was the first mood stabilizer I was put on when I was diagnosed BP2 and I've been on it ever since, which was about 9 years ago. I love this med- I've had NO side effects. I'm on 500mg which is a very high dose but I'm also very treatment resistant. The only negative thing about this med is that I can't go on birth control. I have horrible mood swings and pain around 'that time' and birth control would help, but besides it lessening the effect of the birth control it also lessens the effectiveness of lamictal. There may be some birth control pill out there I can take, but my pdoc, and gyno haven't found it. :( Besides that this med is amazing &amp; I'll never go off of it",10,41
Lamictal,"Did everything right: titrated up gradually as per manufacturer's instructions. Only side effect was a slight front forehead ache in the mornings. Then.... WHAM! About 6 weeks into taking lamotrigine woke up with migraine killer headache &amp; aching joints like getting the 'flu. Then next morning had rash all over body which became raised bumps. Then bloodshot eyes. I was in bed the best part of 2 weeks.  Instantly, I stopped the lamotrigine. Even though my psychiatrist just told me to reduce the dose! Duh! If not for the SJS reaction, I would definitely still be on this drug.",8,30
Lamictal,"This medicine gave me way too much energy. The other night I went on a run at midnight, because I had to burn off the energy. I would say it definitely made me extremely manic. I also stopped getting my period on it, and my breasts grew larger as well. Strange..",4,39
Lamictal,"Very effective but the side effect are bad if I don't take it correctly. I think there are ways you can reduce the effects( getting correct dosage of course) Before you consider going up a dose its worth considering. When you take them? I began taking  mine at night, but have since taking  through the day avoids headache, vision blurred, tremours. I take more last dose, breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner.  Do you take them food?I take them with food, I defiantly feel side effect, every time if I don't eat properly and skiip a meal Are you on any hormone treatment hrt/pill? I have found that there is a, as I call it, lower absorption rate as I'm on hrt and my consultant phy agrees, so I am taking a high does.What dosage? Even 25mg makes a difference.",9,33
Lamictal,"First  I want to thank you all for your helpful reviews. It helped me to do my own research so I can suggest my choice of treatment to my psychiatrist, rather than just trusting the one he suggests. After being diagnosed bipolar 2, he suggested another med. I strongly advocated for Lamictal. I tapered up to 200mg, on a conservative schedule. I've had good results over the past 9 months. It definitely has lowered the instances of hypomania, or at least deescalated the intensity. It's done little to address the depression or anxiety, so we've agreed to add anti-depressant. Again, he suggested Cymbalta, which I opposed due to the all the information regarding withdrawal syndrome. We agreed on a low dose of Prozac which is going well so far.",8,55
Lamictal,"This medication has been very helpful as a mood stabilizer, along with Seroquel and Klonopin.  It keeps me more even. Although I have breakthrough depression and some manic symptoms here and there, for most part, it's been useful when it comes to preventing full-blown episodes, along with the other meds.  I hope it continues to do so.  I take 200 mg total daily.  I haven't noticed any side effects, and I've been pretty consistent taking it.  Lamictal takes a long time to titrate up.  It's done me a lot of good.  I'm working long hours and living a productive life.",9,63
Lamictal,I have only been on lamictal for a few months now. I am able to attend class again function at work and this is the first time in 3 years I've home without some form of severe beak.,8,57
Lamictal,"I've taken Lamictal since 2002 and combined with two other drugs, I've been symptom free from bipolar since 2002.",10,82
Lamictal,"This has been the best medicine for lifting my mood from severe depression due to bipolar. I have come along way. If you have not tried this I recommend it highly. I do take this with cymbalta, but I was on it years ago by itself and got good results. Give it a try.",10,69
Lamictal,"Wellbuetrin (get off the couch). Zoloft (be happy). Pristiq (be happier). Xanax (chill out). Adderall (get 'er done, efficiently). Dexilant (ulcer, of course).  Lisinopril (blood pressure).  Up. Down. Up. Down.  and then....because I felt so awful and helpless, pain pills.  I'm a smart girl.  I understand the epidemic and the risk of addiction, but didn't care.  Went into new Dr. (one that finally didn't just take out a prescription pad and ask me what do you want?, but asked questions to better understand me.  The plan?  To taper off a ton of these drugs (not cold turkey), and prescribed Lamictal.  Game changer.  Less meds for liver.  More money in my pocket.  More genuine calmness and happiness. Seriously, game changer",10,178
Lamictal,"Following about 4 months of being in a depressed state for little to no apparent reason (things were going good in my life), I added Lamictal to what I was taking.  Along with Lithium, I took Lamictal for Bipolar.  Lamictal worked very effectively to remove depression in a week.  The issue was that I got out of depression so quickly, that I actually entered into a moderate manic episode.  The episode did not lead to hospitalization, but had many of the elements that manic episodes have involving spending and lack of sleep and grandious thoughts and behavior.  I didn't experience any negative side effects with the drug, and I just think for me the drug jolted me too much.  No rash or anything, just scared me since I entered the manic.",8,47
Lamictal,I've abused alcohol for 12 years now. I just started taking lamictal the other day and instantly made feel so much better! I have not had any alcohol cravings either and I'm looking forward to the future. I'm so grateful.,10,88
Lamictal,"For years I had been (mis)treated for clinical unipolar. I went through many SSRIs, but each one hit the wall - had only limited effect on the deepest depression, and none as a maintenance drug. Changed pyschs. She suggested an off-label use of Lamotrigene. Within a couple of weeks I felt so much better! We scaled  back (and eliminated) Effexor SSRI. I continued to get better. She moved away, so I had to find another psychiatrist - or psych nurse. The new psych nurse did an interview, and said I was being treated for the wrong disease. I felt better because Lamotrigene was working on my bi-polar! 5 years later, I'm still doing well - mood swings moderated, deep depression less deep and less frequent.",10,93
Lamictal,"Started at 25 mg upped to 50 then 100 over 2 week periods. Feel absolutely horrible. Had rash on face at onset now I feel dizzy, lightheaded, headache, can't handle any smells or smoke, nausea, acid reflux, burping and bruising. Have backed down to 50 and eventually to 25 to get the hell off! Can't drive,  go anywhere or function.",1,35
Lamictal,"This is the first medication out of all the meds I've tried (lithium, seroquel) to stabilize my moods on a daily basis. My mood has never been this stable from as far as I can remember. It took a few months to work though, and dosage is really critical. Going from 100mg to 200mg made a BIG difference. I also started taking more at night which helps keeps my irritability down in the morning. I haven't had any side effects at all from this, except decrease in appetite. Being already skinny, this is a little disappointing, however I'd take that any day over depression.",8,77
Lamictal,"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2005 and tried a variety of things, none of which worked, and actually some of them had bad side effects (Seroquel, for example).  I tried Lamictal as a last-ditch effort, but was apprehensive due to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome issue but that didn't happen to me.  I'm now on 350mg of the drug since then and although I can say it has treated my depression, it has not worked all that well for controlling bipolar symptoms, mainly the buying sprees and bad on the spot decision making (thinking nothing can harm me).  I have been seeing commercials on tv for Latuda and so I might ask my doctor about that.  Also there are some other side effects of the Lamictal that aren't pleasant ...",8,23
Lamictal,"I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, bipolar with depression, bipolar without mania... The main thing I noticed about Lamictal is that it seemed to have helped with ADHD symptoms, that I really didn't know I had, until I read the symptoms for that. I was chronically late, my whole adult life. I lost almost every job I had due to lateness. I had other ADHD symptoms, but that was not my diagnosis. Guess I thought all those things were just character flaws.  After I started taking Lamictal, I was not late anymore! It seemed to have helped with depression, but any benefit from that has seemed to come back. I came to this site looking for extended, long range use of Lamictal.",8,42
Lamictal,"I used to be on Seroquel for my bipolar 1. It basically ruined my high school education, making it almost impossible to wake up and stay awake in the mornings because it was physically painful to endure. Lamictal changed all of that and turned my life around. I have now been on lamictal for 4 years. I have experienced no negative side effects. I am now in college with a 3.5 GPA. My mood is now more controllable, but it doesn't drug me to the point where I am a zombie or a different person. I feel like I can still be extremely euphoric, which is something I don't want to give up. I do sometimes still feel very angry or depressed, but I am able to manage and contain it better than I used to. I highly recommend this to those with bipolar",10,89
Lamictal,ok. Well. Im 30 years old was diagnosed bipolar when i was twelve. I've been on an extensive list of drugs that never worked. So at 15 i stopped taking anything over the counter and self medicated for years I am now comfortable with the idea I may be on something for the rest of my life  and i feel this stuff is actually working for me. It may be because I'm older My brain( for the most part) has developed where its gonna stay.. Hormones are different etc. My only concern is how quickly your body adjusts to it and you have to keep increasing dosage.  I hope we will get to an appropriate level quickly to maintain an even head.. But honestly feel this has made a significant difference for me..,7,45
Lamictal,"I started taking Lamictal over a year ago to treat my Bipolar II and am currently taking a 200mg dose. It has completely changed my life. I no longer obsessively compulsively shop. I can focus clearly. I no longer have raging mood swings. It controls most of my manic episode symptoms but doesn't really help with depression or manic hyper sexuality otherwise it would be 10/10. I'm working on the depression with Latuda with a small amount of success. Currently I do feel flat, calm and sullen but I can't say that is the Lamictal, it could just be the depression.

Anger and sensitivity to sound were still there.         But 6 weeks on Lamictal, I had sore throat and than running nose, sneezing, flu type symptoms and than I notice rash on my chest, so I stop Lamictal. anyone with similar experi",5,26
Lamictal,"I started taking Lamictal to treat my bi-polar 2 disorder. At first, the medication really helped my constantly manic depression and I loved it. Then I noticed the fogginess and my brain felt like it wasn't as sharp. The more my doctor increased my dose, the more I started to swell. Eventually I had gained 5 lbs just in water retention. M joints would ache and I couldn't take it anymore. My doctor switched me to Topamax and I can really tell a difference! I loved the emotional effect from the Lamictal but the physical side effects were unreal.",8,38

Effexor Ce 150, Seroquel xr 200, Seroquel ir 25, Dothep 25 and now Lamictal 50. I haven't felt this stable for years. My psychiatrist would like to leave my medications as is for 12 months to give me some peace from the mood swings. Her goal then is to reduce the Effexor and seroquel. I can't wait for that day. But for now I am enjoying the stability.",8,36
Lamictal,"I've suffered with undiagnosed bipolar 2 for almost 3 decades. For almost 20 years I was on various antidepressants that didn't work, and made my depression worsen. My primary doctor suggested I see a psychiatrist for my lingering depression. Due to the stigma of mental illness, I put it off, but finally saw a psychiatrist.  She diagnosed my condition,  and I started a low, 25 mg dosage of lamotrigine. My dosage will slowly increase over the next 6 months to a year. The first time I entered the psychiatrist's office, I was filled with melancholy and regret.  My first follow up visit to the psychiatrist, I was filled with hope and resilience.",10,84

On several occasions tried to take my own life. The last time I nearly succeeded, was on a 72 hour hold. The Dr. proscribed Lamictal at a low dose of 25mg. Gradually increased in increments of 25mg. I'm now taking 150mg. at bedtime and I no longer have thoughts of suicide, hopelessness or despair. I've been taking Lamictal for 2yrs. now, and I can honestly say that I enjoy life for the first time. Don't give up on this medication as it takes time to work. For me, it was about 2 months. I didn't have any side effects, but everyone is different. Good luck and God Bless!",10,108
Lamictal,"Did not help, Was on it for several months. If anything, it made my irritability worse and my temper shorter.",1,29
Lamictal,"Lamictal gave me two ulcers, failed a drug screen for one of the best jobs around (said I had PCP in my system), debilitating headaches and gained an immense amount of weight. I was hospitalized for attempted suicide and my doc got mad when I weaned myself off. Having said that, I know lots of people that has had great success with it. I guess it all depends on the individual. Not all bipolar cases are the same.",6,24
Lamictal,"I was very tearful when my doctor prescribed Lamictal because I had only been on SSRI medications in the past (they really messed me up and I was hospitalized). My doctor prescribed me Lamicatal at 25mg for 2 weeks, then 50mg for another 2 weeks, with maintenance at 100mg after that. I was tearful because I was terrified to relive what had happened before. Much to my surprise, Lamictal is what I consider my 'life saver'. I feel my moods have been maintained and balanced since beginning this medication. I have not experienced any weight gain at all only headaches from time to time. My libido has actually increased and I read that this medication can affect the menstrual cycle (which it has for me. has made them lighter!). I love Lamictal !",10,69
Lamictal,"Hello! I have not been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but I am 18 and have felt overly sensitive and quick to extreme emotions all my life. I have a trauma history, and have been prescribed Zoloft, Prozac, and Trazadone to cope with my rape trauma, ptsd, etc.. While these meds have helped a bit, My mood swings and my emotional scale still really effects my relationships and lifestyle. I've been feeling really hopeless and self hating lately because of the way I am and have always been. I am being prescribed Lamotrigine by my Psychiatrist and Doctor. I am a little scared at how it will effect me. I hate feeling numb and non-present. I want emotions I just want to control them and not for them to control me. I want to feel whole someday.",8,43
Lamictal,"In my opinion, Lamictal is a great medication. It helped with my moodswings &amp; I didn't experience any side effects from it. The only reason I stopped taking it was because I was having trouble affording it. Otherwise, I'm sure I would still be taking it to this day.",10,24
Lamictal,"I've take so many medications throughout the years. There was always something I didn't like. I always felt off with every medication.

Not a medicated me",1,16
Lamictal,I have Bi Polar Disorder and had so far tried 4 or 5 combinations of mood stabilisers without success. Started on Lamotragine on a small dose and increased up to 100mg twice a day and felt good for a month. Fell then into a low and increased to 150mg twice a day and this has really helped. I recommend these to anyone who suffers with Bi Polar lows often,8,43
Lamictal,"I've been bipolar for 20 years. I'm a scientist, when I'm working. Lithium has always been helpful but is not so great for depression though it does help if you take it a while. I finally started lamotrigine about a month ago. Lots of friends and professionals I know and trust said I should. I was skeptical since drugs tend to be bad news. After just a month (I titrated up quickly, so I've been on 100 for 2 weeks. probably best not do that there's a fatal skin disease you can get) my low level depression feels better.  I'd say it's genuinely beneficial for bipolar depression. A little dizziness but not so bad, and it fades. My friends say there's no evidence that more than 100mg or 150 helps, but it could increase side effects. 100 is good",10,58

My menstrual cycle, children, jobs, school, work, driving, husband, and everything  else not mentioned made me mad for no reason.

While I was in the military they tried numerous medications, from clonazepam and celexa, to trazodone and effexor. Finally one of my Doctors decided to try me on lamotrigine and see how it works. I must tell you quite honestly that this is one of the best medications I have ever tried to combat my bipolar disorder. During the entire time I was being treated for this I had to deal with an injury I had during the war.

I had tried many other medications from my psychiatrist that worked for a short time,   but nothing has been as long lasting as these 2 medications.  One of the best reasons I have for knowing that they are doing their job is.. most people who know me such as friends ,  family and fiance would like to give my doctor a great big kiss..",10,75

I know when I am manic. I know when I am sad and having suicidal thoughts. That 10 years no mood stabilizers, depressed the whole time but able to manage it as the disease This drug now it could have been the combo of lomotrugene and clonazepam.

I am an introvert and like to have a lot of alone time to read, work on the computer, etc. so it's not going to make you an extrovert if you really aren't one.

Lamictal,I was on lamictal for about 5 months. Knocked out the hypomania but did nothing for my depression; it made me feel completely numb which was worse than being depressed/in pain. Also made me horribly nauseous for the entire time I was on it.,2,30
Lamictal,"I've been on this drug for a little over a month now (lowest dose) along with clonazapam, and trazodone for sleep (all low dose).  Like others have said this has changed my life...it felt like I literally changed overnight for the better.  I stil have small crying spells and get agitated, but mostly I'm happy.  I feel I can talk to anyone now, have lots more confidence, and feel way more motivated. One thing too is that since I am motivated and keep myself, busy I don't overeat like I did when I was going through my major ups and downs.  Like others have stated, talk therapy in conjunction with these meds helps tremendously.  What also helps is having a good support group too :)",10,75
Lamictal,"It's a strange little med. You won't always notice it until you come around to a point where you should feel anxious, stressed or depressed and you don't.  There isn't an aha moment until about 6 months down the road to a year. This is because I found for myself, that going up 25 mgs a month worked best. I had gone up fast as the prescribing recommendation but it seemed to fast for me.  Currently at 200mgs, moving up to 300mgs, I've been on it for a year and a half with very good results.",9,75

Lamictal,"I've been taking lamictal for three years.  I never felt it worked in the first place, but the docs kept increasing the dose because it was not working.  After being on 200 mg for about 9 months, I've decided that it was not worth taking a pill that does absolutely nothing for me.  I still get severely depressed.  I've tried most drugs out there and am running out of options, but this is not one of them",1,23
Lamictal,"My whole life has been a process of up and down, excellency and total failure, elation and depression. Finally, since starting lamictal, I have become normal. I don't lose my mind when bad things happen or get so excited when good things happen that I forget to tend to other tasks. Sure, I get sad. But it's normal sad, it's human-- not this overwhelming and crippling process. Same thing with happiness, things make me happy, but not irrationally overjoyed. As a college student, I've decided to commit myself to pre med in the hope of one day becoming a psychiatrist. I want to give other people the same new lease on life I was given. (Mind you, talk therapy is also crucial in personal development.)",9,101
Lamictal,"I have been struggling with ups and downs since I was 17. I mostly experienced a constant state of unhappiness and bitterness with bouts of exhausting excitement and over confidence during short episodes. The depressive episodes were getting more intense with suicidal attempts and I was told many times I could be bipolar yet never really addressed it. I was put on lamictal 5 months ago and it saved my life. I have a new job, my mariage has been saved and I feel very stable, myself still but only the good parts are left. Amazing. Coupled with therapy it's like a second chance at life!!!!",9,104
Lamictal,"I have just started back on Lamictal.  It made a huge difference steadying my mood, calming my anxiety and allowing me to focus. However, it really dried my out.  My skin because quite itchy, and dry and my mouth felt like a desert (bad breath followed).   I felt itchy all over, and ended up getting a rash on my face, which turned into a lump which had to be removed.   My Dr. said that I was taking too much (200mg twice a day).  I took time off Lamictal, and my moods started to fluctuate after a while (not straight away), and my partner took me aside and told me that it was time to get back on it. I have modified my dose to 2 x 50mg which sees me through the day and the evening and the side affects had basically gone.",8,60
Lamictal,"I have been on Lamictal for hmm... ~5 months now. I feel it has seriously been one of the most helpful things in my life. I feel very present to the moment, mostly calm, and overall.. content. It basically just improves my personality. Some side effects though. Terrible memory. Seriously. My perception of time is all out of whack too. I said I have been taking it for only 5 months but that is so hard to believe! It feels like I've on it for at least a year. Oh well. I still like it because lifestyle doesn't require a sharp memory. If your lifestyle does require sharpness I advise against taking this.",9,55
Lamictal,"I have suffered from bipolar disorder for more than ten years but only recently sought help for it because it was getting way out of hand. I was put on a few different medications in the beginning, including Wellbutrin and Risperidone. Those eventually made things worse so I opted out of that treatment, and was prescribed Lamictal. It took about a month to fully kick in, but I have noticed a huge difference in my mental state. I have not had a major depressive episode since starting treatment. I have not gone manic yet. For the first time in many years, I feel normal; I get happy when good things happen and sad when bad things happen. My feelings are not influenced by my illness anymore (at least not yet).

And yes, it took a moment to pull that last word our of my brain and I do goof up words sometimes, but so do all the other alcoholics I know and love. I self medicated for many years and it worked even better after quitting 2 years ago. I still am a little manic, and vaguely depressed under stress, but this treatment has been a lifesaver. I highly recommend giving it a try if your unhappy with your current regimen, but you'll have to give it time. It took me about 6 months to get the full benefit.",9,46
Lamictal,"I was given Rx for lamictal when we finally discovered I had cyclothymic disorder vs. Generalized AD and MDD. I felt great on effexor xr for awhile, then was having severe anxiety  (I thought) which turned out to be a bipolar episode.  We added lamictal and decreased my effexor from 300mg to 150mg. Now I am able to recognize my cycles and take 150mg of effexor from October to march then 75mg effexor March to October. I take 150mg lamictal all year and 1mg klonopin at bedtime every night to sleep. I  am also allowed 1 klonopin daily as needed but rarely need to use that. Lamictal  is my wonder drug!!! After suffering for 20 years trying to figure out the right combination of meds to feel good I  am on track!",10,40
Lamictal,"Lamictal, I feel it has truly helped with ONLY my depression (why I rated a 10), and not with my mania. I actually feel a bit more inpatient with situations and anger grows stronger faster. I have also read that this medication can actually make mania worse.",10,29
Lamictal,All I can say is that I am quite pleased with this--sure hope this drop foot that I have is not related--but I still think I'll keep it--too tired to face another hospitalization ;,10,19
Lamictal,Lamictal rocks! Been on several different meds for bipolar and was beginning to feel hopeless. But doctor changed me over to lamictal and after two weeks I feel like a new and normal person! No more manias and only slight depression episodes rarely! Love it!!!,10,59
Lamictal,"Currently, I'm prescribed to 100mg of Lamictal, 200mg of Zoloft, 10mg of Adderall IR, and 20mg of Adderall XR.  I originally started on Lamictal at 25mg, and it had little affect on my mood stability. I believe it triggered a mixed state episode until I was prescribed 100mg. About two months in, it's been a lifesaver. My moods feel very stable, I am generally happy, and I am able to take care of myself with little resistance. I am also motivated to regularly run errands. (I do believe it may have made me slighty manic.) Prior to Lamictal, I was on 25mg of Abilify, and it was ineffective and made me very tired. I had poor hygiene, I was unable to interact with others or be in public places, and I had difficulty keeping up with housework",9,58
Lamictal,"I take 80 mg of Geodon, 25 mg of Topiramate, 40 mg of Prozac, 50 mg of Trazadone, 200 mg of Lamictal, 100 mg of Vistaril, and Xanax as needed for anxiety. The Lamictal helps me the most out of any drug I have ever been prescribed.  I was on 50 mg of Lamictal and went through a pretty rough depression, I felt catatonic and didn't care about anything - I felt desolate. I am now taking 200 mg and I feel so much better! I have more energy, I have a genuine smile, I feel like my old self again...or, pretty close anyway.",10,47
Lamictal,"Lamictal worked at 25mg seems like every 6 weeks it's time to up dosage, currently at 250 and raise to 275 in week. Is there anything out there I can take with lamictal, I don't want to gain weight. Anti depressant is a med I take also",6,18
Lamictal,"Had severe depression..anxiety. .and elevated mood swings for years.just started meds in my early 50s. ..Lexapro..gradual doses..at first began to notice results in all 3 areas..but extremely sleepy no matter what time i took it...it seemed to level off at about 50% effectiveness...than slowly decreased in its effectiveness. .went on Lamo...more energy..but mood swings came back..no patience or tolerance again, forgetfulness...and anxiety. ..rambling thoughts in my head continually. ..I am returning back to my original prognosis. ..didn't find it to be of help at all....up to 200mg...really don't want to keep experimenting...not sure of next step. ..",2,32
Lamictal,"I am so glad I was prescribed Lamitcal two months ago after struggling with bipolar disorder for the majority of my life. I had been getting progressively worse over the years with manic  cycling frequently to the point I couldn't function. I was very skeptical numerous medications over the years. I thought nothing would help and within three weeks my life completely turned around.  The constant edge is gone, I'm calm, thinking clearing and I feel in control. I am so grateful this works for me, hope it works for you.",10,90
Lamictal,"Deeply depressed for 7 months after a manic period of 7 months.  Would come home from work and just go to bed and stay there for 14 hours until it was time to go to work again.  Taking Bupropion in the AM without effect in increasing doses for all 7 months.  After titrating up the Lamictal through the increasing doses as required, the fog lifted 3 days after I started on the 200mg dose.  Thank you modern medicine",9,66
Lamictal,"I was diagnosed bipolar II a little over 4 years ago. I was manic for a long time, I'm talking 2 years. With episodes of extreme depression. I wouldn't take my medications and ended up in and out of several mental health centers at several hospitals, well over 10 hospitalizations. I was a reckless mess. I can't even remember a lot of that time period. I was losing everything along with my mind- I was gone without a doubt. I saw this Dr yet can't remember his name, while in the hospital and he was so nice and didn't want to sedate me like I had been in the past. He put me on lamictal for the first time. This was 3 years ago. It saved my life. Works within the first week. Seriously the best mood stabilizer ever.",10,73
Lamictal,I have been on this drug for 4 weeks I notice very subtle changes. I've titrated up 25mg a week every week  and I'm currently taking 125 mg. I still am probably 3 weeks away for full effects but I am noticing some good things. I no longer think about killing myself all day and I have less anxiety than I did four weeks ago. I feel optimistic that better days are ahead. I also take ativan for anxiety but will likely discontinue once I'm at the key mg amount which I believe is 200.,6,44
Lamictal,This is the best mood stabilizer I have been on!,10,49
Lamictal,"I have Bipolar II, with gradioise mania and severe depression. After about a month of taking Lamictil, my moods stabilized dramatically. At one point, I supplemented with Abilify, but have recently been able to stop taking and now rely on Lamictil solely. I attribute Lamictil to saving my marriage and career; it scares me to think about how my life would be without it!",10,81
Lamictal,"I have only been taking this medicine for a week but I am 100% a totally different person! My husband has been as patient with me as humanly possible but I could see that my constant anxiety, depression and crazy up all night crying feeling like I was a person that couldn't be loved by anyone begging him to love me (he would just sit there and say I do love you baby with all my heart) but it was pushing him further and further away I am 23 and have been in emotional and mental hell since I can remember with sick and demented dreams. I have tried several different meds lexapro Wellbutrin seraquil xr Xanax Zoloft. I'm now on celxa and lamictal and I feel like a new person my Dr saved me my relationship, my life and my family!!",10,108
Lamictal,"This was the first medication I tried after being diagnosed with bi-polar dissorder. at first I started at 25mg and it worked for a few weeks after the initial week of pure headaches and drowsiness. Soon after though it became ineffective and my anxiety levels progressed. It seemed like because my body relied on the drug I didn't know how to deal with my swings without them so I felt like my swings were worse. Then we kept getting higher and it worked but kept stopping until I got to 200mg one in the morning one a little later. We did this so when the half life wore off I could take it again, and so far this has been amazing. My swings are calm and I feel genuine happiness aside from my anxiety (which I am trying different meds for) I'm great",9,51
Lamictal,"For years I have been misdiagnosed. I have been on Cymbalta, Seroquel, Celexa, Xanax, Olanzaprine, Vyvanse, and many other drugs I can't remember the names of. Then I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After multiple medications my doctor put me on Lamictal. At 25mg I could tell that I was feeling better but I was still experiencing depression and hypomania. After two weeks I increased to 50mg and started to notice a big difference. My moods were more stable and I could function normally. Although lethargy is still a problem but nothing coffee can't cure! Now I'm on 100mg and although I'm still tired, I feel much better. This has saved my life and my relationships!!",10,70
Lamictal,"ABSOLUTE LIFE SAVER. I am 25, a sober alcoholic (2 years) and diagnosed with MDNOS. I would love to get a real diagnosis - bipolar is as close as they've come, BPD is my personal view. Lamictal seriously changed my life. It leveled me out so that I could live my life and not have terrible bouts of sobbing in the closet wishing to die and screaming at people at the same time. I was still not super happy, so we added Lexapro, which helped a lot and Celexa later (instead of Lexapro), which helped more. Really want to switch to Wellbutrin XL now because I have no sex drive which is detrimental to my relationship, plus I'm late for work pretty much every day and could sleep until 1PM. But I will never go off Lamictal, serious life saver.",10,49
Lamictal,"I'm bipolar with mania. Also, I've been a addict for 25 years (self medicating my mania). I hated all the mood stabilizers I've ever tried, but would always eventually go back to using. Anyone that has lived in a constant manic state of mind knows how hard it is. After many many years of trying to get clean I reluctantly gave Lamictal a try. It has literally saved my life. It has totally balanced my crazy brain. My thoughts are not a 1000 miles an hour, I can actually sleep and eat normal and most importantly I no longer self medicate by using drugs and alcohol. My wife can write a book of what this medication has done for me and our family.",10,100
Lamictal,Lamictal helps with my bipolar depression. I haven't felt helpless or hopeless since starting the medication. I take the maximum dosage of 200mg twice per day.,10,49
Lamictal,"I have mercury-poisoning induced Bipolar II and took Lamictal. It made me feel great until I ended up in the hospital with erythema multiforme covering my whole body and aseptic meningitis. I was very disappointed because I was starting to feel really good on it. Andy Cutler Protocol has been the best treatment for me thus far, but I really wanted something to eliminate the depressive episodes (my manic ones are mild) while I get all the mercury out.",3,19
Lamictal,"I just started this med and I am on week 5 of the starter pack. I know it's a little soon to give my opinion BUT I want to give words of encouragement if you're struggling with your diagnosis and taking that pill. I spent so much time in a deep, dark hole and I started getting scared that I wasn't going to see sunshine in my life again. I became desperate enough to call my Doc and agreed that I was probably bipolar (she saw it and I was in denial!) and I was willing to talk meds. After the first two weeks I noticed that life was looking better and I felt like participating a little...by the end of week 4 I was able to have a conversation. I'm starting to see beautiful colors in my once bleak world!",10,91
Lamictal,I've been on this medicine 175mg per for 5 years-cyclothymia-miracle medicine. I was either angry or ecstatic on any given day. Now the same guy shows up every day-so thankful for this medicine.,10,57
Lamictal,"I've been on Lamotrigine (lamictal) for about a year. DR VERY slowly dosed me up to 150mg mostly because I keep missing doses. It begins working immediately. You'll experience drowsiness with each dosage upgrade. I started feeling more normal and balanced. It has also reduced frequency and intensity of panic attacks, no more tremors (might be due to addition of proprananol). I feel I should have been on this for years before now. I think it has increased made my skin dryer but thankfully no rash. It helped me cope with grief and aggression too. I've insisted that Dr never take Me off this med.",8,44
Lamictal,"This was very, very good. I have MDNOS (Mood Disorder Not Otherwise Specified) however, it is likely that I have Bipolar 2 Disorder, and my doctor has used the terms hypomania and major depression to describe elements of my condition. I also experience some anxiety. I tried Zoloft before, but as many people with Bipolar Disorders know, that can lead to some bad things happening. I had significant side effects and it made me irritable.  When I got to Lamictal, I immediately noticed how much better things were. First, I began to feel less depressed, and I noticed that I had virtually no side effects. I have never even heard of a psych medication with no side effects (for me at least). It worked well for all of my problems.",10,71
Lamictal,"Lamictal is a great medication for the depressive side of my bipolar 1 disorder, but try as I may, it is not a good mono-therapy, meaning I can't take it alone.  I need another mood stabilizing medication with it or it causes anxiety and irritability to worsen.  I'm giving it 7 of 10 stars because it doesn't work for bipolar 1 as a mono-therapy and has effected my memory and ability to recall words and to read quickly.  Side effects for me are reading difficulty, memory issues, and break through anxiety and irritability.",6,44
Lamictal,"I've been on lamictal for about a month now. I started on 50mg, 2nd week 75mg, and 3rd week 100mg at night. 1st 2 days in on 50 I felt borderline aggressive and very irritable. This evened out on the 3rd day and I began to feel very motivated and able to think clearly. I still experienced a few depressive episodes, but I hope to get onto an antidepressant once my dose is high enough. I've began taking 25mg in the AM to slowly move up to 100 in the AM on top of my 100 at night. Since I have, my memory, attention, and anxiety have worsened and other side effects have been sweating, raised heart rate, some trouble sleeping, and slight photo-sensitivity. Most of these have subsided as I adjust so overall it's best to stick with it for a bit.",8,28
Lamictal,I have been on this for about 8 yrs. It is the only thing that made me feel normal with out being loopy or high. My only thing is that I am needing to either increase it or add something. Open to suggestions.,9,46
Lamictal,Not very helpful for the depression except at higher dose of 300+mg. at that dose I experienced severe hair loss: About a third of my hair fell out in about four months,6,25
Lamictal,"Post concussion, leading to: explosive outbursts, withdrawal from activities I used to enjoy, addictive behaviors.  I wasn't worried about the skin rash; the evidence is clear when slowly titrated up, the risk is  low.  I have experienced some cognitive sluggishness and muscle cramping at 150mg, but they are only annoyances.   Drug saved my marriage and job, allowed me to become self-reflective (rather than self-hating) again.  Also, I have experienced another (very welcome!) side effect: um, er, astonishing sexual pleasure.  When I told my doc about this, he smiled, said a small percentage of patients will have this side effect.  I'm glad I have!  So, the drug has worked well for me in many regards.",8,40
Lamictal,"This medication literally saved my life. I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder Type 1. I also experience mixed episodes and psychosis.  I've tried countless antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics. Upon being recommended this anticonvulsant, I was skeptical. It took a while to titrate to the effective level. I am now on 300 mg of Lamictal every day. This medication gave me head aches at first, I also experienced weight loss. I still have my bad days but they're not as intense and frequent as they were before this medication. I now have the will to live again, thanks to lamictal.",10,34
Lamictal,"I experienced depressive episodes once every 10 years or so, 18 months duration. When my husband died suddenly of coronary problems in '89, I was in a down stage--which didn't change until the Dr. and I found Lamictal. Tried 11 meds before without result, still locked into depression. Was tired or hyper while we worked out the dosage. Very slight hair loss was a small price to pay for a new life! Friends even remarked on the favorable attitude change. I can't thank the developers enough and it's a shame it doesn't work for all bipolar II sufferers!",9,64
Lamictal,"Thanks Lamictal, my moods are level (no lows or highs),no more rapid cycling or rapid thoughts, feel confident, happy, more energy, haven't had one depressive thought since starting this medication and at my correct dose of 200mg (cut in half and take 1/2 tablet twice per day, works out cheaper this way). Finally found the best medication for me.",10,85
Lamictal,"3 yrs, 150 x 150mg. Too many side effects including total oral decay due to no saliva production.",10,39
Lamictal,"I took Lamictal for 6 months to treat bipolar and anxiety. As far as I can tell, it did nothing for me. Took forever to titrate up, due to the risk of rash, and am now weaning myself off. Trying Seroquel now, which is showing far more promise.",3,23
Lamictal,"works great for mood swings and temper problems, substantially reduced anxiety",10,70
Lamictal,"After years of antidepressant tablets that worked only to blank out my memory and let me survive, I went on to lamotragine six months ago.  Suddenly and quickly I started to feel normal again. My long term memory has returned, and I take pleasure in music and nature again.  I feel so much happier.  On the negative side the fatigue became a problem but has reduced as I reduced my dose to get to optimal.  Insomnia and vivid dreams have increased but I can deal with that.  Also blurred vision and dizziness that is slowly disappearing.  In short a miracle for bipolar 2. I also take Lexapro.",10,26
Lamictal,"This has saved my life, but make sure to take it on time",10,62
Lamictal,"As a mood stabilizer for Bipolar Disorder, Lamictal has worked wonders for me. I was worried about getting the dreaded Lamictal rash but never did. My doctor followed the guidelines for increasing the dose slowly and I never had any side effects. I have been on the maintenance dose for several months and I actually feel normal. If there is such a thing. I am currently taking Lamictal in conjunction with the antidepressant, Cymbalta. Finding the right medication(s) can be very frustrating, but please don't give up.",10,91
Lamictal,It has saved my life. Literally.,8,85
Lamictal,"While taking this medicine... It keeps my mind racing, kept my heart %u2665 racing. For the 3 weeks I've been taking it my blood pressure stayed high while taking the meds now that I stop taking them my blood pressure been back to normal. I stayed very hot &amp; dizzy while on it. I felt the same just had a little energy.",2,25
Lamictal,"I've suffered from depression and anxiety since I was a teen, made worse after the birth of my child. I tried various antidepressants which had the usual side effects of headaches, sluggishness, low libido and weight gain. One was a total disaster and triggered a hypo manic episode. I've spent 3 years medication free, with no manic episodes but still struggling with depression.  3 weeks ago I started Lamictal. I know it's early days to call it a win but I immediately felt better. The volume on that horrible self talk has been muted, I feel positive and optimistic. No headaches, no loss of libido and it is weight neutral. I have noticed a few side effects - the first week my skin was very itchy and I'm losing more hair than usual. Hope this subsides.",8,59
Lamictal,"I have rapid clycling bipolar disorder and was diagnosed five years ago. After trying, Seroquel, Risperdal and Lithium with failure, a combination of Lamictal and Rivotril works for me. All the other medicines never work or side effects where making me drowsy.   I got side effects from Lamictal for 2 days when I increased the dose every two weeks until I got to the recommended dose and I take Rivoril to control anxiety every now and then.   Also the anxiety diminished as the Lamictal dose got closer to the full recommended dosage.",10,62
Lamictal,"I was on Lamictal in the past and it was wonderful, it really helped me control my mood and anger issues but of course like any bipolar person I stop taking medicines. I was but on other meds that affected me the wrong way. I am now back on them and can't wait till I am at my right dosage. You have to give it time and slowly get to the right dosage. It CAN and WILL help. In past I was on it for 2 years.",10,100
Lamictal,"I titrated up to 100 mg over a two month period. I have had chronic depression since my teens, with one episode of hypomania and rapid cycling. I have taken Depakote, which had horrible neurological side effects, and Tegretol, which stabilized me but did nothing for depression. The Lamictal has completely done away with depression. My only side-effect is anorexia. I have to force myself to eat and I get full right away. I needed to lose weight so this isn't a bad thing.",10,78
Lamictal,"This medication has changed my life.  While I have notice that I've gained a few pounds, that's nothing compared to me being able to live happily again.",9,76
Lamictal,"I'm on Wellbutrin already and was recently put on Lamictal, it stabilized my moods a bit, but I stopped taking it due to the horrible insomnia and very vivid dreams.  Every time I went to bed and managed to sleep I woke up exhausted due to my brain consistently running through the night. I had to stop it, I was tired all the time because of the horrible insomnia.",3,54
Lamictal,"I love Lamictal  not only does it help with stabilizing my moods it has reduced my migraines by 85%. I have bipolar I, rapid cycles, with mixed episodes. With regards to the scare of the rash, I have no problems going from 100mg to 200 or 300 in dosing. I have so side effects at all. I have taken pretty much everything out there but this one has done well for me for 7 years now.",0,82
Lamictal,"I am 52 year old male and Lamictal was a God send. I was in a bad way for a few years until a new doctor said, We can fix this and prescribed Lamictal.  Within a week, I was back. I was able to get on top of and manage my depression,  anxiety and anger. It was so great to be the person I wanted to be instead of the angry mess I had become. That may sound overly dramatic,  but it's true and may speak to some of you.",10,239
Lamictal,Seeing all the positive reviews its upsetting it didn't work out for me. I started losing my hair very rapidly. My hair is the thinest its ever been in my entire life. So I stopped taking it.,1,56
Lamictal,I sing the praises of Lamictal. I have been on 150mg in the morning for over 7 years along with Seroquel XL 100 mg at night. The combination has changed my life. I could not imagine life without depression and anxiety before I started these medicines. No side effects from either one. I feel fortunate.,10,102
Lamictal,"I felt it necessary to leave a review because of how well this medication has worked for me. However, I have been quite seriously bipolar (with panic disorder) for over 30 years. As you can imagine I have been on many medications. About two years ago nearly everything had gone wrong in my life - including being homeless and drinking far too much. I pulled out of that with the help of Seroquel. But I was still having really really bad times. Then I met someone who suggested this medication. Well it was not instant but slowly I started becoming normal. Normal to me is wonderful. Now I hardly drink.. Why - because I drank to cure myself.. I actually wake up and look forward to the day. I feel young again!",10,221
Lamictal,"Duration 3 years I am 23. This medication changed my life and I am not exactly sure why I take it because I feel normal I wasn't bipolar however I was just flat out raging deeply depressed would stay up all night. I did crazy things. I also had horrible life threatening anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder and sitting still. I almost stopped taking it when I finally went to a DR because I couldn't go to college anymore because I was a complete wreck all the time. Every tiny little thing threw me into anger and depression and jealousy. Medication made me sick in beginning but the Dr told me to keep taking it which this is how these medicines work. After around 3 months. I was NOT depressed EVER, slight mood but I'm OCD and moody in general! Anti-depressant did not work.",9,111
Lamictal,"I've gone from 25, 50,75,100 and been on 200mg a day for 4 weeks now. I've been on lithium, Seroquel, Seroquel XR and could not handle the side effects of all. Lamictal has been magic. I can feel the change completely, I just feel like everything is a little 'slower' and that I'm not racing all the time. Bipolar 2. Best medication I have been on by far and can honestly say that this is one I plan to stick to. The side effects were small but there, dizziness when standing, headache and a little nausea for the first 6 weeks on and off but nothing compared to the emotions of bipolar.",9,149
Lamictal,I have been on Lamictal for almost 3 years now. I find that it keeps my moods stable and doesn't have the side effects I experienced on other medications. I was able to continue taking it while pregnant and breastfeeding.,9,83
Lamictal,After being diagnosed as bipolar from an exceptional great doctor he spent almost 2 years trying different medications and combinations he found Lamictal worked for me. I am on  a once a day dose 100mg and went from severe to working full time and enjoying life again. The worst part was losing my family as they don't understand it. It begins with a good doctor and being true to yourself to know what works.,9,181
Lamictal,"Worked wonders!  Went off Depakote ER, lost the 50 lbs, went on Lamictal, also take 20 mg of Lexapro for depressive moods.  Feel great!",10,88
Lamictal,Bipolar 2(now 65) with years of trying every mood disorder medicine around until Lamotrigine was recommended for Bipolar 2.

Lamictal,I'm 54 yrs old now &amp; I've struggled most my life with severe depression and anxiety. Many issues in my life would be intense and just make me be so upset. Taking this Lamictal now for 2 months at 200mg. Has so much stabilized my mood. I've been so much more settle and handling situations more calmly . A Great medicine.,10,136
Lamictal,I have been taking Lamictal for 4 years now it has helped me to manage my symptoms even though I have had to have a few adjustments to the medicines recently. With the increase so far I haven't had any episodes.,9,58
Lamictal,"Diag: Bipolar 2 with predominant depression, plus panic disorder. I have been taking a very low starter dose (25mg) of Lamictal for about 3 weeks. I'm due to up the dose to 50mg now. Aside from my anti-panic emergency medicine and proprananol for blood pressure, I've never upped a dose of anything. I typically give up on a medicine for one reason or another (not effective, negative side effects, complicated dosing, cost, etc). Lamictal is a prescription that I intend to up my dose to 50mg though, and will do so gladly. People have commented on a more calm &amp; mellow mood, a greater tolerance to stress and irritations, and being more pleasant to others. I'm on a slightly more even keel now &amp; look forward to seeing what's next with increased dose",8,148
Lamictal,"Started this medicine slowly 25 mg a day for two weeks, then went up to 50mg for 2 weeks. Still did not feel much better, went up too 100mg a day for 4 days feeling lethargic, the fifth day on it starting feeling a little better. But, I started getting itchy all over and started a very small rash on my side near my butt, My doc told me to stop it, cut the dose in half last night and then stop. He put me on Tegretol today, taking my first dose at dinner.",8,43
Lamictal,"I wasn't on this long enough to see anything positive, because it made me lethargic, gave me headaches, body aches, and completely sunk my libido. Two other people I know who went on Lamictal around same time as me also had their libidos die.",2,51
Lamictal,"I have been on and off this medication for nearly 10 years and it has been generally helpful most of the time. It takes a long time to titrate up, and the there is a very specific dose that is different for everybody, but once you get it right, the medication is remarkably helpful. In my experience, it all but eradicates Bipolar Depression and it reduces the severity of Bipolar Mania.  Don't worry so much about the rash if you're a hypochondriac like me. The Rash most likely would only be limited to mucus membranes around the eyes, nose, mouth and genitals. One thing I should add: over time, the medications seems to lose effectiveness and if you frequently discontinue, this effect is exacerbated. Eventually I had to add lithium.",9,67
Lamictal,"I was on so many medicines, hoping from doctor to doctor until I found a neuropsychiatrist who took me off all that gunk and had me try Lamictal. While I am not cured, I most certainly am far more functional with my highs and lows being far less extreme.  I also take Prozac to make sure that Lamictal alone won't make me hypomanic. I become that way if on Lamictal alone. I have been on these two medicines for many years. This is the first time ever anything has worked, worked reasonably well and this long!",10,91

Life does have ways of kicking me and those times are when other meds have been added or tried, but I always end up on Lamictal regardless.",9,83
Lamictal,I have since I was very young displayed what I know now as Type I Bipolor disorder. Probably one of the worst feeling in the world is to have emotions ebb in and out like tall crashing waves. Then the sun comes out and the water is calm. Then a couple days later here comes the storm. It is the worst feeling to think there is nothing that will help. I felt that way.....time after time different meds. Abilify to be one exact example led me to have Hypothyroidism. A condition I have to have meds for the rest of my life. I have after trying many different meds for depression to find only one medicine I would suggest and that is Lamictal. If you are compatible with this medication it will help the mood swings a great deal.,10,102
Lamictal,"This is the first medicine that has helped my 14 year old daughter. She has tried Prozac, zoloft, vyvanse, pristiq and some help from Wellbutrin. She has not been accurately diagnosed. Many different professionals have suggested dysthymia, anxiety, ADHD, borderline personality disorder, MDD and bipolar II. She has been hospitalized 3 times. The last time she got out of the hospital, I asked if we could try a mood stabilizer. Lamictal was the doctors first choice. We slowly titrated up to 200 (it took 3 months), but it was well worth the wait. No side affects. No more roller coaster rides. Most importantly, my daughter has an understanding of what can trigger her moods and has the clarity to learn more about herself.",10,157
Lamictal,"I have Bipolar 2. I was diagnosed in 2009 but had suspicions long beforehand.  So was put on Prozac, Abilify. While I notice Prozac helping, especially when I don't have any and I begin having withdrawal, I've found that Lamictal really does the job! It's very subtle,  maybe because I'm on a very low dosage. Yet, I notice it. I'm more calmer. Not calm completely,  just calMER.",6,82
Lamictal,"I have been taking 300mg of Lamotrigine each day for about 3 years.  When I first took it, it made me feel sick and anxious and gave me headaches, but after following some simple advice from my psychiatrist I now DONT GET ANY SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL!!  He told me to increase the dose slowly (25mg per week) and to always eat when I take the tablets.  I've found this medication very effective as an antidepressant but not effective at controlling mania / hypomania.  Despite this, I still rate it very highly because it is so much more bearable than any other psychiatric medication that I've taken in the past.",9,105
Lamictal,"Saved my life after trying various antidepressants with no results. Felt dizzy and nauseaus the first weeks, but noticed improvements in mood within days.",9,86
Lamictal,"This is the best psych med option I've ever had.  Over a six-year period, I had been prescribed a myriad of medicines for bipolar mania and depression, including: Abilify, Wellbutrin, Zyprexa, Celexa, Prozac, Lithium, Geodon, and Tegretol.  Lamictal has been a Godsend.   Lamictal has not been associated with weight gain nor diabetes (I have type 2, but was diagnosed prior to my prescription).  All psych medicines have side effects, and finding the most benign one can be maddening, and even life-threatening, in my case.  Give this one, at least a shot.",9,138
Lamictal,"It seems to be helping, but still some depression remains.  I have Bipolar Type 1, so I have struggled with mania, hypomania, mixed mood, and depression.  I do notice I'm more even, which is what the medicine intends to do.  I take a combination of meds, so it could be difficult to tell which medicine is doing what.  All I know is that I have no side effects, which is good, because I requested a mood stabilizer that will not make me gain weight.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the way things are going (thank goodness, because Bipolar could be hell).",8,78
Lamictal,"Lamictal has been working pretty good so far.  My only complaint is lately depression is creeping up on me, but this could be just part of the winter blues.  On Lamictal, I am not emotionless; it just helps with the dramatic mood swings (I have Bipolar type 1).  I was given Lamictal as an option due to the fact that I requested a medicine that will not make me gain weight.  As I was told, I do notice Lamictal seems to be weight-neutral, which is a good thing.  I haven't been on Lamictal more than a few months yet, but I am hoping it continues doing its job.",8,62
Lamictal,"I started Lamictal about a year ago. Nothing else worked, the medicines made me tired and sometimes worse. My family noticed a huge change in my moods and I don't nearly get angry at all. This medication is awesome! I take 400mg a day now, but I was pretty bad! I thought I was better once and stopped taking it and oh boy my family was like get back on your meds! I will never stop taking this medication again! My son has bipolar as well, I am going to ask doctor to try him on it as well! Only side effect is dry mouth.",10,95
Lamictal,"My experience has been terrible.  I am 42 and an educated woman who works in a high capacity job and I can't function. I have been to the emergency room twice for disorientation and garbled writing/texts.   I have had several falls or balance issues,  one fall caused a concussion, now I walk with a cane on occasions.     I constantly forget things, events, appointments and more.  I finally had to go out on medical leave.   I am in the process of discontinuing all psych meds as they are ruining my life!!!",1,77
Lamictal,"I have taken lamotrigine for about 5 weeks.  I tapered from nefazodone to lamotrigine over the course of 3 weeks.  I am currently at 100 mg of lamotrigine.  I was feeling better than I have ever felt in my entire life for about 2 weeks, now I am back to where I was before.  No, I was not feeling manic during those 2 weeks but I felt that my anxiety had been greatly reduced and I had a true appreciation for life.  I feel a bit cheated that I got to feel normal for once in my life and then poof it is gone.  I kind of knew that it  was too good to be true or to last.  Oh well",5,54

Lamictal,I have tried and failed every medication out there!! I just could not tolerate the side effects and weight gain. I came very close to suicide and I finally got on lamictal. What a difference!! I am finally not having the mania keeping me up for days and the severe depression of constantly writing suicide letters. I am also on klonopin. I had to go off my meds during my pregnancy and my husband said  I will never get you pregnant again!!! That is how much better I am on the medication. My dose is 300 mg. split twice daily. I had gastric bypass as well and I am tolerating it the same as I was before. I have been on Lamictal for 8 years.I wanted to share my experience so that I might touch someones' life and make a difference!,10,244
Lamictal,"This is a very good medication IMO.  When you titrate up to the dose intended, you will notice subtle differences.  Many times I have thought that this had flattened me out but when I backed off the dose, symptoms came roaring back.  No noticeable side effects for me.  Helps stability very well, maybe the cause of some anxiety not much tho.",9,48
Lamictal,"I was diagnosed bipolar after suffering a mental breakdown in college which left me institutionalized used for 2 weeks. Before my therapist prescribed me lamictal (100mg) and Klonopin (.05mg) I was a total mess. lamictal truly saved my life. It helps me act less irrationally and impulsively, hold a job for longer than 6mons, maintain healthy relationships with loved ones, I feel more focused and driven. I have had no negative side effects.",10,146
Lamictal,"Change my life dramatically within a week. I'm mixed-rapid-cycling. I rapid I mean within the same day. Worse, I feel like behing depress and maniac at the same time. Lamotrigine solve most of that. No real side-effet but vision, dry mouth. I feel that I taught is more clear and vivid than ever. Good feeling. I also have interesting dreams. I'm taking presently  250 mg/night. However now it's time to ajust again. Symptoms are coming back. Last word, add 300mg lithium, zopiclone 10mg and zyprexa 2.5",10,28
Lamictal,IQ of 130 but troubled emotional status. Wide range of problems extending from Paranoia Anxiety Anger Delusion Bitterness Depression to Suicidial. Had 3 major Bipolar Attacks in 2008 2010 and 2012. Successful career hit the bottom in all these attacks. Lamictak is the greatest drug for me it most literally SAVED MY LIFE I am using around 125mg daily and I know how I am. Before using this drug I really never did !! If you have similar symptoms never hesitate. Give it a TRY for sure.,10,78
Lamictal,"For bipolar and depression: although I believe its about 80% depression.  I started with 100mg and eventually got to 200mg. Took about 2-3 solid months to have full effect, and had unbearable back pain the entire time, and could only take it in the morning. Sleep was impossible with night dose. Once it started working, I really did feel so much better. Back pain stopped. Still have daily spurts of 'I love everybody' mania but my lows sometimes last days, lately longer. Unfortunately, my depression symptoms have started coming back more frequently and when I tried adding a 200mg dose, I had mind blowing joint pain. The pain was indescribable. Has caused me to gain about 10-15 lbs in the past year. Also not the rash, but have weird spots on skin.",8,46
Lamictal,"I have very extreme rapid cycling bi-polar disorder, it had become much worse in the last 6 months and I had become extremely irritable. I had just about all of the side effects that came with this medicine but I knew it was helping me. I truly needed the treatment and for my children would see this through. After a month or two all of the horrible side effects were gone. This medicine was a miracle for me, saved me, and my marriage. It allowed me to step back and realize the problem in my life was me and I needed to change and this medication brought me back to my old self. I was in denial of how sick I had become until I took this medication and became normal again.",10,153
Lamictal,It helped but I stopped taking it because I'm trying to conceive.,9,22
Lamictal,"Because of weight issues, my doctor decided Lamictal was the only way to go because it wasn't supposed to cause weight gain.  While they just upped my dosage to a therapeutic amount, I can say my friends noticed a difference at lower dosages.  It really does make a difference and I'm hoping at the current dosage, I completely even out.  I also take Paxil (my depression was severe when I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder) and Xanax.  I do choose to take the Lamictal in the evenings because it makes me very groggy.",10,61
Lamictal,"I am on the 3rd day on this medication. After just one pill, my mood became much better, but the downside is that it causes insomnia and when I fell a sleep finally, I have nightmares. The dry mouth bothers me the most, because it causes bad breath. Also, in the afternoon I get so tired, I have to sleep when I am not working and I sleep a lot, like 3-4 hours.",6,48
Lamictal,"I have been on Lamictal for approximately a month now for bipolar 1, slowly working up to what I am now at 100mg. I have noticed a dramatic drop in depression but hypo mania only slightly changed, I think it only feels like it has worsened because the depression isn't there to bring me back down, I still can't sleep at night, I still panic, feel the doom of anxiety, and racing thoughts among other things. I have had an incredibly increased libido, overall I can't believe how well its working in such a short time without the terrible side effects that other medications can give you. I'm a mom of 4, I have no time to be a zombie, confused, tired and slow, I look forward to seeing the next few months.",8,75
Lamictal,Lamictal has been the most all round effective medication I have take and that is saying a lot for a patient of 40 years. What I mean by that is my system rejected all antidepressants and antipsychotics because of a side effect called Akathesia. I sustained on lithium and Klonopin alone for a long time. Back then doctors were scared to death of Lamictal because of the rash that few to none got when properly prescribed. I couldn't find one to prescribe so I got it from my family doctor. That was the best day of my life. I titrated the lithium while slowly adding the Lamictal with no problems. I have been taking 450mg a day ever since. I also noticed how badly 30 years of lithium had hurt me. I no longer knew myself.,10,84
Lamictal,I took lithium for bipolar for years. Lithium took the highs &amp; lows out leaving me with no personality at all. My Doctor changed my medicine to Lamictal &amp; I feel I'm back to whatever normal is.,10,102
Lamictal,"I didn't expect this to work when I used it to prevent mania. 225mg of venlafaxine (Effexor) caused mania. After being on low-dose Abilify and Seroquel to sleep for a few weeks, I was not really manic anymore (maybe hypo-, or had some manic symptoms- like usual, e.g. destructibility). Then I started lamotrigine, now on 100mg/day. I increased venlafaxine back to 225mg expecting to go manic, but instead I feel clear-headed. Friends have noticed I don't lose my train of thought often, and that I seem more stable. I have been diagnosed Bipolar I, but am more like a II, which I agree with. I also have Social Anxiety Disorder (and used to have the most severe depression imaginable). The Bipolar might be caused by S.P. Seizures.",9,46
Lamictal,"Love this medication.  I do not experience any side effects and do not feel like a zombie.  I feel like a normal person, but can definitely tell this medicine works.",9,91
Lamictal,"I started taking Lamictal 3 years ago. I have class 2 bipolar disorder. Before the Lamictal I have always had doctors (since I was 16, I'm now 27) tell me I was depressed. But with the Zoloft and Prozac I would go into extreme manic states and clean my floors for 6 hours, spend all my money on crap, cry uncontrollably or even get violent. I was like that already just worse on those medicines. Finally seeing another doctor trying to find help he put my on Lamictal. Small dose at first and now I'm on 400mg/day. I have gained weight 15 pounds and have been on a diet for a year and see a personal trainer. Absolutely cannot lose weight. I still have all of my same bipolar symptoms but they are not uncontrollable now. I am on lithium 200mg/day",7,33
Lamictal,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 seven years ago in College. I refused treatment, and my relationship with my husband started to deteriorate. I started Lamictal a year ago and have totally returned to my old self. I am happy, calm, rational and I found the motivation to lose fifty pounds. The only down fall is I kind of miss the ability to process information at a very rapid rate, but I gladly trade it for a great relationship with my husband and child.",10,146
Lamictal,"I was diagnosed with bipolar II when I was 18 years old. I have been on Lamictal for a year and a half now. Within a month of starting this medication I saw amazing results. I have experienced no depression and no hypomania whatsoever. After having bipolar II really run my life in my teen years and cause me to temporarily lose sight of myself, I feel like I have reconnected with who I truly am since starting this medication. I feel more myself than I have in so many years. I still feel things deeply hence unlike some antidepressants which numb you, per my own experience, Lamictal does not. If you truly have bipolar II, this is a wonderful medication. Much Love to you all on this tumultuous journey; stay strong and never lose hope.",10,253
Lamictal,"I've been on Prozac for 2 years for post traumatic stress disorder, in May 2012 I had gastric bypass surgery and recently went back to my doctor because I felt like I wasn't even on my Prozac anymore (I wasn't absorbing it after surgery) so he doubled the dose. After 3 days I felt way worse! So we dropped the Prozac back down and doubled my Topamax. The combination of Topamax and Prozac made me feel awful! I had uncontrollable crying, bad nausea, and was probably the most depressed I've ever been. I was diagnosed with a mild form of Bipolar, so we started on 50 mg of Lamictal for 3 days then we bumped to 100mgs. Its been 5 days, but I can honestly feel a difference! Haven't cried since, feel better mentally and I'm just happier.",8,62
Lamictal,Lamictal changed my life!  It is what I use as an antidepressant for Bipolar II (300 mg in the morning) along with Seroquel ER 100 mg at night which keeps my anxiety in check.  No side effects from either.,10,69
Lamictal,"I've suffered with Bipolar II for roughly 7 years, after two suicide attempts, months of insomnia, and horrible manic events, I finally found a doctor who knew what he was talking about! In combination with Prozac, I have started my titration of Lamictal. I tried Zyprexa and gained 20 pounds in a month. With Lamictal, I've lost that and more. I hardly feel hungry. I have faith that once my dose is increased I won't have as many depressed days. So far so good!",9,81
Lamictal,"I'm 16 and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II a month ago. I was put on Lamictal six days later. Around two weeks of the effective dosage, I started to see stability in both my depression and hypomania without any personality change or affective flattening. I did get canker sores however, but no signs of the SJS rash yet. This is overall a pretty effective medicine from my experience.",8,47
Lamictal,"I have been taking Lamictal for the last 2 years, its amazing and life changing! Very little side effects, besides weight gain for a lack of words, losing weight seems to be impossible for me, and I workout 5 days a week, so for that reason, I'm looking to see what else is out there.  If by chance you are reading this and looking for something to help, this is IT! Really!",10,63
Lamictal,Great medication. Immediate results. Life changing for me.,10,84
Lamictal,I was treated for years with Bipolar 2  disorder using various ant-depressants. They all made my moods cycle up and down. I'm now on Lamotrigine 300mg twice a day and feel better than I have in 20 years.I'm 66 now. I had to start slow and gradually work up to my present dosage. It was definitely effective for me to do it this way.,9,80
Lamictal,"When I was 15, I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder. The first ever medication for it that I was on, was Lamictal. Worked absolute wonders, until it started making me have my period every two weeks. So I stopped. I absolutely felt great on it, so it disappointed me that I had to get off of it. I have had a daughter since then, so I'm thinking my body has changed because of the pregnancy. I'm trying it again, and it actually started helping the next day! My psychosis is not under control because its only a mood stabilizer, but my thinking is a little clearer, and I'm in a better mood. Not quite there, but I can feel it working.",0,62
Lamictal,"I'm a 30 year old female and I've had many different diagnosis as well. I've tried and failed with many antidepressants, antipsychotics, among others. Nothing ever worked or made me feel worse! Then I found Lamotrigine. I've been on 50MG a day for ten days now. After six days I was feeling great. But now I'm getting mood swings, itchy, slight headaches, and lots of crazy dreaming. I am still a little depressed and thought this is not going to work either. But thanks to all your good reviews I'm going to hang in there, wait until I find the right dose, and hopefully feel as good as all of you.",7,69
Lamictal,"Depression ever since I can remember.  Had 15 good years on Prozac, but it stopped working.  Have been trying all kinds of antidepressants &amp; in December I was put on Lamictal.  Worked up to 100 mg, stayed on for awhile, not much happening - thought it was just another med that wasn't going to work.  My doc said the therapeutic dose so am slowly titrating up to 200 mg - currently at 175/day.  Just yesterday I think I started feeling the miracle of Lamictal kicking in!  Yesterday and today I have felt better than I have felt in soooooo long - don't stop before the miracle happens (unless you have bad side effects, like the rash, which thankfully I do not have).  I want to shout my gratefulness from the rooftops!!",9,103
Lamictal,"Found Lamictal to be wonderful, with *NO* side effects (can't say that about many medicines). Really worked for mood disorders. No withdrawal symptoms when I stopped it either. While I do not currently take this, if I am having a rough time with depression/mania this is what I request.",10,52
Lamictal,"I have been taking Lamictal for about a month and I can see the difference the only thing is that I am itching all over. I was wondering if that is normal with this medication. I have no rashes or red bumps, just I itch .",7,40
Lamictal,Evens me out... Reduces the ups and downs.,10,46
Lamictal,This medicine and Geodon in combination saved my life. I have been functioning normally for three years now. Hardly any noticeable side effects if any and mild to no mood swings.,10,38
Lamictal,"I have been on Lamictal for about two months. Yes, I have some side effects dry mouth, double vision sometimes when I blink it goes away, joint and muscle pain and now I think acne. I take 300mg during the day. 200mg at night. I also take gabapentin for muscle aches and joint pain which really helps! I also take Klonopin when necessary I am prescribed for half twice a day and one at night but don't need it. I have a ton of energy and lost weight food no longer is my priority. I exercise daily and feel fantastic! I do have anger issues I have always has that. I am in therapy also. I think and feel like a different person so the side effects far outweigh going off medicine! Good luck.",9,53
Lamictal,"I'm a 33 year old female.  I have been taking Lamictal for 5 years.  I don't know what I would do without this medication.  It allows me to lead a normal life.  I have been bipolar my entire life although was diagnosed with just depression until I was hospitalized with my first manic episode at the age of 22. I take 200mg Lamictal ODT (orally dissolving tablet) morning and night.  Lamictal ODT is expensive and tastes awful but the ODT works better than the regular pill form of Lamictal for me. I have no side effects I know of. I also do cognitive behavioral talk therapy, practice Tai Chi, and do my best to get regular sleep.",10,66
Lamictal,"I've only been on Lamictal for 3 days, so I really can't give a full review, however: today is Sunday and I took my first pill Fri before bed. I woke up Sat morning and laid there for a good ten minutes thinking Something is weirdI realized, my mind was calm. For as long as I can remember, I've constantly had running thoughts and was always thinking of multiple things at a time. I can now think straight thoughts, I'm able to think a good amount clearer and because of it my stress has been a lot lower.  I'm taking 25mg for Bipolar Disorder 2 and will write a new review as things develop. I haven't seen any change in my moods, but I've only just started. I've had a few dull headaches but no other side effects so far.",7,84
Lamictal,"If my mania wasn't a thing to be reckoned with, I'd stop taking this. My hair has been thinning for the past year, and without Abilify in my combination of meds I'm a total zombie.",6,13
Lamictal,"I had to stop taking lithium because it was damaging my kidneys and I got really sick, so I had to turn to Lamictal and expected it to not be as good. But it really is. The only downside is that since you have to slowly increase your dose to avoid the terrible rash, it might take a while for you to get to a level where it's helping as much as it can. But once you get up to the dose that's right for you, it's awesome and I haven't noticed any bad side effects.",9,83
Lamictal,"I have been on this for 2 weeks and it has saved my life. I started to feel much better after only 4 days, racing thoughts were gone - the only side effect is nausea, and loss of appetite which is ok. I also take lithium (am weaning off after 10 yrs on) and Paxil 40 mg. I wish I had been on this years ago.",9,63
Lamictal,"My experience with this medicine is positive especially since my recent dose increase. Before, getting up in the morning was hard.",9,53
Lamictal,"After experiencing severe depression since middle school, I had been misdiagnosed and prescribed several different antidepressants, which only made my then-undiagnosed Bipolar Disorder worse. Finally in 2007 I was correctly diagnosed with a mixed/manic episode, and began taking Lamictal. I have had zero side effects whatsoever, and it stabilized my mood swings immediately. I am now supposed to take 200mg twice a day, but after 5  years of the icky-tasting pill, I tend to skip doses every couple of days. Probably as a result, my depression has come back, but at least I haven't experienced the manic/mixed episodes that I used to have before Lamictal! I can truly say that this medication is a lifesaver, although it seems to have worn off.",9,41
Lamictal,"I've been on Lamictal for 2 years, 400mg a day and I can't say enough positive things about the medication. The only downside was the time it initially took to get to the dosage that my doctor and I found to be effective for me. I would say before I noticed it was working was over 2 months. Which I know seems like an eternity when you're desperate, feeling crazy &amp; at times suicidal, which I was. I haven't had any side effects and I'm so thankful for Lamictal!",10,69
Lamictal,I have been on this one for 10 to 12 year this one work for me .,10,43
Lamictal,I just started taking 25 mg a day a few days ago. So far I'm tired after taking it and very thirsty. I do feel good after the drowsiness wears off and am already starting to feel good. My jaw hurts a little and slight headache. I will post again in a few weeks.,8,40
Lamictal,"I am a female, 29 yrs old. I have been depressed since I was 14yrs, my mind races constantly and I have mood changes and a bad temper that turns in to severe anger (rage). My Psychiatrist prescribed me Lamictal and it really works. I have had no side effects and my mood is stable and controlled. I have been on it for 2 years and feel good.",10,74
Lamictal,After being unstable for years this medication has changed my life. I have been stable for two years now and wouldn't change for anything in the world. It has changed my life,10,59
Lamictal,"Vivid dreams, nightmares, night terrors, sleep paralysis, frequent awakenings during sleep, thought blocking, memory lapses, word retrieval problems, concentration. Sleep disorders eventually fade but they were certainly debilitating. After 200 mg my mother reported I had strange behavior a few times that I don't remember. Besides these side-effects it has a very noticeable effect on depression. I would risk all those adverse reactions for this pill. Saved my life.",9,53
Lamictal,"Have been taking it for 2 years. Stopped my seriously depressed moods 100%. My hyper moods as well, although did not have these as often. I was severely depressed and couldn't go to work, angry, and my mind was spinning all night.  This was going on for years.  I never realized it could have been a chemical imbalance until I flipped from giving up on life, to everything is great!  What was I thinking! Then back to giving up again within 3 hours.  Lamictal has made all of this stop.  It's wonderful to be normal again.",10,81
Lamictal,I love this medication. Slowly my emotions are getting stable! The first few weeks are rough because it hadn't taken effect. Wait it out and hopefully it will help you too!,10,56
Lamictal,"It works great at first then you have to keep increasing the amount every two weeks. By about a week into each increase I feel like its not working and I feel mania coming on. I always know because I start biting my fingernail. I'm about two months into and really think I should find something stronger. Or combine it with something else. You are not supposed to drink alcohol but that is he only way I have found to even out it not being strong enough for me. I you are taking it, and it is working for you, that is great!",6,20
Lamictal,"I have been on many mood stabilizers over the yrs for bi-polar 1. I have stuck with Lamictal because it hasn't caused distressing side effects that are difficult to live with, such as tremors and restlessness.",10,33
Lamictal,"I was on this medication since 2006. I had no side effects or problems. It worked well, we had to keep increasing my dosage on it though. I also combined it with Depakote, which apparently raises your Lamictal levels. Yes you can become toxic on this medication like Depakote. I had to get off the medication because I became toxic, I was taking 300mg a day and 1250mg of Depakote daily. My symptoms were drunk look, double vision, slurred speech, short term memory loss, I started bumping into walls, my eyes were glazed over. I just got stupid towards the end. I even went to the hospital telling them I was toxic, they did not believe me. It can happen, I guess I became intolerant of the medication.",7,37
Lamictal,"Well, I don't know what to say. If only I would have been taking lamotrigine when I was younger. I've been having moods swings and anger since I can remember, since the age of 11. I am 31 now and this is the only medicine that makes me feel the way I knew I should feel. I have no side effects. The worst thing of having bipolar 2 was dealing with my horrible anger problems and having people scared of me. I used to hold on to the fact that my son was the only reason I was alive but lamotrigine has given me a new lease on life. Lamotrigine makes me feel like I should have felt since I was younger!",10,107
Lamictal,"This medicine was horrible for me. Not only did it not help - it made my symptoms worse! The whole time I was on Lamictal, I was a raving lunatic and it brought my friends and family to their wit's end.  I was dizzy all the time and never felt hungry. My hormones were all out of whack, causing my periods to be irregular and horrific. It also messed with my birth control and I wound up pregnant - a pregnancy that later failed due to further complications. I know this medicine works for some people but it's not a miracle for everyone. I was on it for about 4 or 5 months.",3,29
Lamictal,"It seems to have leveled my moods somewhat, or at least reduced my agitation.  It is also inexpensive (compared to say, Lexapro).  I soon developed problems with my eyes in that they are itchy, red and swollen and I have decided to discontinue due to my fear of getting Steven-Johnson syndrome.  It is meant to be a rare side effect, but seems to be more common than I thought.   This medication has also increased my appetite, given me strange dreams, and headaches.",3,25
Lamictal,"I started the medicines and it worked okay. Then they started to up my dosage and I felt sluggish. Once I got to the amount I was supposed to be at, I was paranoid, distant and irritable. My period is 10 times worse. The cramps are unbearable. My face broke out and I look like the before picture of a proactive commercial. I have to pee frequently. I'm getting off these medicine as soon as possible. I've been taking them for 5 months now.",1,37
Lamictal,"I was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder exactly one year ago. After about 4 weeks on Lamictal, I noticed a huge change. I could feel feelings again. The bubble of depression, rage and mania I lived in popped. I could communicate again, without getting frustrated with everyone.  I am taking Lamictal with Wellbutrin and Abilify. No side-effects and my life - both professional and personal - has done a complete about-face. I am happy again. I remember how happy feels, and I'm there.",10,81
Lamictal,I have been on it for years. My sons are also on it..if taken as the directions of your doctor its almost perfect. Our moods are stable and we almost feel normal.,10,42
Lamictal,"This medication made me sleepy when I first started it or have to bump up my dosage for a few days, but the side effect goes away. I take mine at night before bed for bipolar, this has drastically improved my quality of life. Moods, organization (helped, I'm also ADHD) anxiety, and sleeping pattern. I've been on it for almost a year now and won't ever go back. The only bad thing is when I forget to take it for more then two doses, I go manic and don't sleep. So remember to take it!!",10,63
Lamictal,Lamictal saved my life. Literally. Helped with suicidal thoughts and a feeling of going crazy beyond control. Later I added Cymbalta and Provigal as well. Able to have a more regular life now! Takes awhile to kick in since you have to build up the dose but stick it out- definitely worth the wait. (I've tried several others and Lamictal is by far the best).,10,46
Lamictal,"Varying levels of depression since early 20's.  Anxiety also an issue.  2 bouts of major depression: one in late 40's and one in mid 50's.  No hospitalizations.  Now 63 yo.  Taking 200mg for 2yrs, -  minimal side effects, and very effective in mood regulation.  Never had a manic episode, but had been fairly quick to anger and somewhat argumentative.  I would have to say this medicine has helped a lot.  Some changes in my life circumstances may also be helping  (retired) --  but I have to give this medication an endorsement.  Worry a bit about taking it long-term -- but so far, no side effects.",9,38
Lamictal,"I am 47 and I have suffered from depression as long as I can remember. I have been on so many medications for depression, I lost count. The best one for me has been Cipralex, but I would still experience major episodes several times a year. I was desperate this past January and ready to give up hope. Not give up as in harm myself but I just couldn't shake the blues for the entire month. I mentioned it to my doctor and she prescribed Lamotrigine (2x25mg) per day. I felt better immediately like the next day. Has anyone else experienced instant relief or is it just a fluke. I wonder if I was bipolar all along but wasn't able to articulate it for a proper diagnosis. I am one month depression free.",10,64
Lamictal,"Lamictal is an interesting medication. It worked very well for controlling moodswings, particularly the rage filled depressive mixed episodes but caused absolutely massive memory and congition problems about 8 months into treatment at 200mg a day. It was odd, the world just kind slipped into the present. I couldn't even do things like cook toast because I would forget what I was doing. I have since cut the dose to 25mg a day. It works far less well for the moodswings but doesn't mess up my mind much now. All in all, mixed results. I still take it. It beats the alternatives which were awful.",6,38
Lamictal,Lamictal helps my mood swings but sometimes it makes me stutter or feel like crying. Other than that I am satisfied with the treatment for Bipolar 1 disorder.,8,17
Lamictal,"Lamictal really worked great at stabilizing my moods and eliminating my manic episodes. I stopped blowing things out of proportion, being paranoid, and having rage attacks. I have been taking this with Wellbutrin everyday. The side effects were brutal to begin with the first few months and I had to go backwards on my dose and increase it slowly. I am always lightheaded and dizzy. The first few months I would lose my balance and have to grab something to prevent falling on a daily basis. Now I'm used to it and can recognize when I need to stop and let my body adjust before I move, but stabilizing my moods has been a life saver.",9,34
Lamictal,For bipolar 1 Lamictal has worked wonders for me. I did have to watch my moods because with all mental health medicines it can make side effect better or worse and it did enduce me into a state of depression. Other than that I have been on it for 9 months and has been doing good so far.,10,17
Lamictal,It keeps me calm and relaxed most of the time.,10,22
Lamictal,"I love what Lamictal has done for me. It's a mood stabilizer that should be prescribed secondarily alongside with another medicine for bi-polar disorder. Mine is the anti-psychotic Geodon, which I slowly came off of over 6 months wanting to get pregnant, but unfortunately, I ended up in the hospital in a severe manic episode with following depression as usual even though I stayed on the Lamictal. I have taken Lamictal for 7 yrs and its wonderful to not have depressive episodes and mood swings. I take an awesome combination with the Geodon and I Highly recommend it to Bi-Polar 1 sufferers.",10,24
Lamictal,This medication has been a life saver.  It has changed my life around. I can't believe how happy I am!,10,47
Lamictal,"I was told that Lamictal might help me find strength.  Well, it did - a strength that was inside me all the time but was drowned out by fear. I have been on this pill for 10 months now and the horrible fear scenarios that have plagued me since an early age have all stopped. I am far more in charge of my life now. I only wish I could have had it before. First effects of pill were immediate, but it took some months to take full root.",9,56
Lamictal,Have been taking Lamictal for 4 years (400mg). I had severe mania for 3 years before that. Went through 13 different medicines. They all seemed to make things worse and became very destructive with not only my life but I also became dangerous to others. If it were not for Lamictal I would most surely be dead. I sometimes still go through the depression and have added antidepressants but too many side effects. I have insomnia so I also take Ambien CR and Xanax. It's not a healthy combination but it all works for the most part. I'm sad for those of you that had to stop taking Lamictal for some reason or another. It's a great thing not to be sick anymore.,9,34
Lamictal,"I felt a change in my moods from Lamictal almost immediately. I haven't felt that great in years, but I developed a rash in 1-2 weeks of taking it. It started as itchy hands and feet and then I itched everywhere.  I did not have a severe or life threatening Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. I did drink alcohol on this medicine and it made me get drunk really fast and I would have very bad hangovers. I had to discontinue after 1 1/2 months because of the rash. Two of my friends take this and never had rashes and they also agree it is the best medicine they have taken for bipolar.",8,29
Lamictal,"I have been diagnosed with Bipolar.  Initially, I really did not believe that I had this disorder.  However, I feel so much better after 1 month on this medicine.  I feel normal for the first time in 4 years.  I am happy and energetic.  I also notice a significant improvement in my memory and concentration.  Since the medication has made a significant improvement in my quality of life, I am no longer in denial.",10,55
Lamictal,"I've been on it for three months, with a very slow ramp up phase. I've been dealing with major depression for 25 years and have been in all kinds of antidepressants, which work for a while, then stop. My doctor started to wonder if I might possibly be bipolar 2. My moods would cycle frequently within days. Deep despair to feeling just fine. Not mania. Just feeling good.     Once I was on the therapeutic level, 200mg I felt so even keel. And I've been holding steady for almost two months!",10,41
Lamictal,"Lamictal has been effective for me. I had not realized some of my symptoms until I was unable to afford it and went off it for couple months. I had more depression, began to emotionally over eat, increased difficulty in making decisions and paying attention, and feeling of being overwhelmed. I am fortunate enough to have the means to get back on my medicines. I function without it, but this makes my disabilities more manageable.",10,33
Lamictal,Broke out in a rash after 2 weeks.,0,21
Lamictal,"I started taking this about five years ago for anxiety/OCD/extreme irritability (bipolar spectrum) and it is a great mood stabilizer. However, it seems all great remedies have their side effects. For me (40-something female) that meant some hair loss and memory issues. Also, I've noticed that if I miss even one dose (I take 150 mg twice a day) I start to get really agitated and irritable, so I'm afraid that it's permanently altered my biochemistry - guess I'm stuck with it. I still think I'm better off than the fat zombie most women become on antidepressants.",8,26
Lamictal,"Lamictal has been a life saver for me. I gained 20 lbs on Abilify. I experienced horrible side effects from Geodon--I thought my legs would run away from me.  I cried all day on Wellbutrin.  Nothing seemed to work.  After slowly increasing the dosage on Lamictal, I started feeling better.  I got out of bed.  After about 2 months, I'm back to normal, no tears, sleeping only 8 or 9 hours instead of 12, going to yoga 5 times a week instead of watching Law and Order SVU reruns.  I'm back to normal whatever that means.  I am also on Topamax and Pristiq.  Great cocktail for me.",9,44
Lamictal,"I am taking this medicine to treat Bipolar Disorder Type 1 and I have never had a side effect.  I have been taking it for about 5 years in conjunction with Gabapentin.  About six years ago I started having dual episodes, which were new to me as I had only experienced mania or depression.  After a few stays in the hospital and being introduced to Lamictal, I have not had a dual episode, or any episode at all. Lamictal has also stopped 96% of the paranoia feeling that has never gone away.",10,30
Lamictal,"Caused anxiety, panic attacks and rash.",1,26
Lamictal,"This medicine did its job. Took about a week for me to feel the actual effects. But I had to discontinue use because I developed a really bad rash around my mouth. I had to stop because the rash and other side effects. I wish those side effects never happened or else it would have been something that I would have wanted to be apart of my medication regimen. I also have Schizoaffective Disorder, it really helped me manage those unusual thoughts and behavior. Otherwise this would have been my medication of choice.",8,13
Lamictal,"It works better than other medicines but I still have some days that it looks like I'm without treatment and I repeat some behaviors of the past when I was first told I was (am!) a bipolar. But I love Lamictal. I took as far as 500 mg, but that was not much better than 200 mg per day.",9,17
Lamictal,Lamictal is very helpful in controlling my mood swings.  What I like is that you can start on a low dose and work your way up until you find the dose that works for you.,9,23
Lamictal,"Seemed to help my rapid cycling at first but the cycling would start again after a short time and the dose would be raised. Each time the good period got shorter.  I also found that my suicidal thoughts/visions increased while taking this medicine. Side effects are bad - all over itching, headache, thinning hair, etc.",1,26
Lamictal,Lamotrigine has been very effective for my Bipolar. Coming off Lamotrigine is very hard but I found the supplement 'milk thistle' very helpful and only managed to come off it completely with its help.  I am back on the lamotrigine now as I my moods became extreme again without it.,9,20
Lamictal,"Gave me really bad headaches, nausea and all over body rash.",1,18
Lamictal,"Thought I was going okay. Feeling the best I had in awhile. But, what it has done now is destroy my self confidence. I have no word retrieval, memory black spots. I value my intelligence, it sometimes feels like all I have left.",5,35
Lamictal,"Lamictal has changed my life.  I started on Lamictal 2 1/2 months ago and I can't believe the clarity and happiness in my day to day life.  For years, I have been on various antidepressants. I had never been to a specialist, only my primary care physician to discuss the problem. I got to a point when I couldn't remember when I was happy and felt normal.  I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but no mention of Bi Polar.  My severe mood swings were affecting everything in my life. My relationship with my husband, kids, my lack of motivation.  I felt like there was a constant cloud over my head, when I had nothing to be depressed about. The Psychiatrist I went to diagnosed me with Bipolar and started the Lamical.",10,46
Lamictal,Keeps my mood even 24/7...also I have noticed no side effects either. Been on this medication for 9 years 300mgs daily.,10,36
Lamictal,"Lamictal combined with Seroquel XR has changed the quality of my life. My obsessive compulsive disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder were masked for many years by the severe depression.  Eventually a different doctor realized it was not enough. The Lamictal was added and helped to calm my OCD but when the Seroquel was added it was awesome; I felt normal. If the Lamictal is helping but you still don't feel right, your doctor may increase the dose. Talk to him/her often and don't minimize a symptom because you think it is too small to mention. Some symptoms overlap and may be masking an untreated problem. Summary: Lamictal works. No side effects. I'm grateful for it every day.",10,43
Lamictal,"Wonderful medicine, changed my life for the better. I am a completely different person behaviorally, but still the same personality! I do not get depressed or anxious like I used to for 20 years, while on SSRI antidepressants. This medicine is a miracle.",10,44
Lamictal,"I suffer from bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, mood swings, etc. I have been on Lamictal for about three weeks and I am taking 150 gm a day and I already feel better than I have felt in years and this is just the beginning. I am having no side effects and I am feeling so much better I can't wait until it becomes full circle and I feel the full effects of Lamictal. Love it, there is hope. Don't give up I am also taking Paxil 20mg.",10,35
Lamictal,"I am also another person saved by this drug. I was irrational, iratic and unstable before I found Lamictal. There is so much more peace in my life and peace in the lives of the people that my disorder effected.",0,45
Lamictal,"I have been on Topamax for three-four years, it makes me so sleepy, so then I switched to Lamictal. Lamictal makes me hungry but I feel better and have energy. I am going to take both and hopefully, it will work great together.",8,11
Lamictal,"Simply my miracle medicine. I actually became myself again. After 15 years of trying EVERY antidepressant available (I've become an expert on antidepressants). Lamictal was my doctor's last resort. After about 2 weeks, a woke up on morning, turned to my husband and said I'm back. Have been on it about 8 years now and I'm truly me not bipolar or depressed. I take it in combination with Wellbutrin...perfect combination for me.",10,51
Lamictal,"I went back to the doctor today and she did prescribe Lamictal 25MG 1 tablet once a day for 2 days, then 1 tablet daily for 2 days, then 1 tablet in the morning and 2 at bedtime for 2 days then 2 tablets 2 times a day. I was also prescribed burspirone 15mg 3 time a day,  Paxil 20 MG once a day and Trazodone 50 MG. Lamictal had worked for me in the past. I hope these other medicines works well with it. Has anybody else this combination as well I would like to here from you.",10,4
Lamictal,Excellent medication for bipolar disorder although I had a reaction to it.,10,9
Lamictal,"This medicine has changed the quality of my life, and those who are in my life. It has been greatly enhanced by my usage of this medicine. I wish everyone who suffered mentally could use this medicine as a magic pill, but I know that's not possible. I was on so many different medicines before my doctor put me on this - misdiagnosis on his part - and I'm so glad that this medicine exists for us bi-polar folks.",10,34
Lamictal,"Before I started taking this medicine, my moods were up and down, anger, anxiety, not sleeping at night, back pain, fear of leaving the house, etc. This medicine has changed my life completely. I don't feel like the same person. I never enjoyed living the way that I do now. I'm up early in the mornings, doing things and being productive, which is so different from what I used to. Thanks to this medicine, I'm actually living. I've tried so many things and nothing else works. Miracle by far. No anxiety, no sleep problems, energy, and relationships are improving so well.",10,70
Lamictal,"I've been on Lamictal for 7 years for severe depression - love it. I do better, it helps control the suicidality and anger and helped me keep a job when I am well enough to work. Word of caution: DO NOT TAKE ESTROGEN CONTAINING BIRTH CONTROL WITH THIS MEDICINE. It lowers the amount of Lamictal in your blood by half, so you go through withdrawals, then on the fourth week of the month you are toxic. So take the medicine if it helps, but beware of mixing it with birth control pills.",9,26
Lamictal,"This medicine has been amazingly helpful. After being misdiagnosed with depression I began taking this once my bipolar symptoms were diagnosed correctly. For those of you who may not think the drug works, I wonder if your doctor is doing a blood test to determine if your dosage meets the therapeutic level. Also, I learned the hard way that birth control pills totally negate the effect of Lamictal. It took a while to straighten that one out. Thanks to all for writing in.",10,23
Lamictal,I use this medicine for depression and it is really effective.,9,20
Lamictal,I took Lamictal for 4 months at 100mg to treat bipolar disorder type I. My mood swings decreased only slightly. I discontinued medication due to the fact that it made me very itchy.,3,16
Lamictal,I haven't been on Lamictal for very long yet. But I want to thank all the people who shared how it has helped them. I am having a very hard time hanging on right now. I am getting married to the love of my life in 2 1/2 months and could care less. I am actually thinking about canceling the wedding altogehter. Depression is impacting my work and my relationships with my family. I don't see much point in hanging on at all.   Reading about how others have benefitted gives me a ray of hope that it will help me too at some point in the future if I can just hold on long enough. Thanks.,5,39
Lamictal,"Miracle. I have been on 6 different medications over a 10 year period since I was 17 and nothing seemed to be working.  My family doctor was no longer capable of helping me and I was referred to a psychiatrist.  He immediately recognized my symptoms, put me on Lamictal, and I feel like a new man.  The suicidal thoughts, the racing, the lack of sleep...all of it reduced down to almost nothing.  I still have anxiety at times, but I take a Xanax every now and then to just help me calm down.  But overall, my quality of life has improved by 99%.  I do, much to my embarrassment, seem to have erectile dysfunction.  It is not that I have a problem getting an erection, but it seems to be a self confidence issue.",9,24
Lamictal,"Worked great when added to lithium for mixed manic episode. No side effects but I got a rash and had to quit taking it.  The rash gradually disappeared, luckily.",9,15
Lamictal,"I have recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and have found Lamictal (lamotrigine) to not only balance my mood, but to elevate me back to feeling human.  This is profound and very refreshing.  Having experienced mild to very severe depression all of my life, I have also had an acute and moderately severe manic episodes. Over the past two months I have worked my Lamictal dose very slowly up to 200mgs of Lamictal coupled with 25 to 100mg of Seroquel (primarily for insomnia and secondarily for mood).  Side effects have included memory loss, word recall problems, and distinct weight gain (even though I exercise often and rigorously).  Overall I would say this is a wonderful medicine.",9,26
Lamictal,"I am a young 60 year old female. No one believes me that I am really 60! I was just diagnosed with Bipolar 2. I have been depressed for years and the antidepressants just stopped working. I over the last 8 months had become very angry, irritable, happy at times, and severely depressed to the point of wanting to die every day. My doctor finally sent me to a mental health professional and she diagnosed me bipolar. I started taking Lamictal and the first week I noticed I was feeling more even and not depressed. A month later now I feel as if I was handed my life back. I did have nausea with it, but that went away. Now I feel at peace inside! I have no depression and am finally HAPPY. Thank you Lamictal.",10,59
Lamictal,"I have been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 Severe Mania episodes for many years and PTSD.  I am on Lamictal, 200mg, Topamax 100mg, and Abilify 30mg.  This is a wonderful combination and the first time in my life that a combination works with little to no side effects.  I have a significant immediate family history of suicide and although the thoughts are always there I don't act on them and can ignore them with the help of this medication combo and my severe manic episodes are from 8 to 9 severe episodes a year down to 3 to 4 which for me is almost normal. With a little more tweaking of this combination I may be able to get it down a little lower than that, we are working on it.  I've been on this combination and changing the dosing for about 2 years now.",10,16
Lamictal,"This is a great medicine.  Many people don't know about using it as an alternative to SSRIs for mood stabilization, depression and bipolar disorder. I've been on it for 1 year. The biggest benefits of this medicine is that it stabilizes my mood without feeling weird (fake, plastic, hyper) with very few side effects.  The sexual side effects and weight gain I experienced on Prozac, and the restlessness and irritability of Celexa and Welbutrin, just don't occur for me on this medicine.   The drawback for me has been a narrowing of my emotional bandwidth.  I rarely feel spontaneous excitement or joy.  This may be partly because of life circumstances, but I'm certain that this medicine is also playing a role here. High anxiety, may not be related to this medicine.",8,31
Lamictal,"I've been taking Lamictal now for about 4 years, I haven't had any side effects that I can tell but after reading others experience of memory loss, that could be one that I do have.  I take the maximum dose that is prescribed now and I can't say enough about this medication. I was so totally lost, severe depression, suicidal, lowest of lows, it was so bad, I couldn't get my ducks in a row (my mothers comments to me, daily). Now, I'm feeling in control of my life, I'm back with my spouse and caring for my mother, who's ducks have scattered about, and I'm living happily.",10,58
Lamictal,"I am very satisfied taking Lamictal 100mg daily. For the last two years from my most recent manic attack, I have not experienced any bad side effects about the pill. Unlike Depakote and Seroquel, it gave me a massive weight gain.  Lamictal is good for people if you are not getting any rashes.  I give this drug a rating of 9 for its efficacy.",9,26
Lamictal,It's so nice to be sane without side effects.,10,28
Lamictal,"I've been on Lamictal for almost two years now, along with Lithium. I like Lamictal a lot. I have to get off Lithium because it's raising my blood pressure and causing weight gain. Lamictal doesn't cause any side effects that are dangerous, I think I have memory problems and concentration issues but nothing too bad. I'm a full time second year college student with a 3.8 GPA so if anything this medicine is helping me do well in school. For anyone who had a bad reaction I feel bad for you because when this drug works it's doing the business. For sure, good luck new users. Try never to increase your dosage too high; remember the higher it is the harder to get off.",10,41
Lamictal,You don't even know it is working. You just feel better.,10,51
Lamictal,"I've had bipolar for 10 years, and just recently (last 2 months) switched to Lamictal and am experiencing no side effects.   In the past, I have been on Depakote (5 years, bad blood counts) so switched to Lithium (tremors and shakes), and am now on Lamictal/Geodon.",10,18
Lamictal,"Before starting Lamictal I'd been hospitalized 5 times for rapid cycling bipolar disorder 1, made one serious suicide attempt, and had more than 50 ECT treatments.  I've been on almost every mood stabilizer, antidepressant and antipsychotics.  Lamictal has been the most helpful, and has made me feel like almost a normal person- living and back to professional life. Side effects; hair thin, nails okay.  Sometimes memory, and concentration problems- but hey, I did have a lot of shock therapy.  Once I had sudden, severe double vision that lasted several hours.  Overall has been most effective with best side effects for me, smoother moods, less severe, better weight, better skin, better libido, better gastrointestinal effects than lithium, other mood stabilizers or antipsychotics.",0,65
Lamictal,"I am 58 years old and diagnosed last year with mild bipolar disorder, agoraphobia, anxiety.  I felt very happy most of my life although having behavioral problems, and didn't start having real problems until I was 50. I tried Wellbutrin and it gave me hives. Celexa made me so wired that I couldn't sleep and felt like I was going crazy. Effexor worked but I was tired all day.  Lamictal was miraculous. I have taken it for a year. It gives me energy, I feel happy and motivated.  I don't feel angry anymore. I LOVE it. I gave it a 9 because it gives me memory problems which I do not like. But I feel that it is really a lack of concentration. So I try harder to concentrate and it helps when I do more mental things, like read.",9,60
Lamictal,"This medicine is a life saver. This one keeps me away from depression and works really well with other medicines. I'm now only taking Zoloft with it and I have never felt so good in my 8 years of being medicated! These two drugs are easy on the body and have very few side effects like the anti-psychotics. Please talk to your doctor about it, you will not regret it!",10,113
Lamictal,"The help I received from Lamictal was outstanding.  It took a few weeks but my down cycle wasn't nearly as bad and the mania all together stopped.  In time the cycles all stopped.  BUT the side effects were too much to handle.  I started to lose hair, my fingernails were so think I broke nails typing (even on many vitamins and prescription vitamin D). I would bruise just by a bracelet resting on my arm for a few minutes and then the bruise wouldn't go away, the worst side effect was terrible circulation.  I have been on Topamax and experienced the poor circulation they talk about all the time, but this was something else entirely. I couldn't feel my finger tips and my feet had NO feeling.  My hands were ice cold all the time.",6,26
Lamictal,"Decent. Little to no side effects. Helped with a really nasty depression, but keep forgetting to take it, so may not be doing entirely what it's supposed to. Oops! But no weird effects from forgetting it.",8,10
Lamictal,"I found this medication very good for my bipolar depressive episodes. No side effects, and as I take it continuously it helps prevent recurrences of my down cycle.",9,18
Lamictal,"I am diagnosed with Bipolar II and PTSD. I have been on 300mg of Lamictal for over 3 years and it is, indeed, a life saver!  When I first started taking it I felt as if a warm gentle hand reached in and touched me exactly where it hurt. As I write this I recall that before starting Lamictal I had excruciating pain in my solar plexus. I was in a deep state of bipolar depression with spikes of rage and extreme anxiety at least 2 times each month. Lamictal has made these mixed state less severe and not as frequent. I also take Paxil CR.  As for side effects, at first I had headaches and nausea but I endured them gladly.",10,41
Lamictal,"I have been on Lamictal 400mg for 7 years.  I was diagnosed with bipolar 10 years ago this year and prior to Lamictal had been on many different drugs with negative results.  I was very discouraged, thinking life could never as it was prior to bipolar entering my life - but then started on Lamictal and along with Wellbutrin and have not had to change medicines since.  Occasionally, I do add Topamax to it during the winter months for low moods.  Other than that - life is good!",10,42
Lamictal,"I've used Lamictal for years and it's pretty good. I have some side effects, but I don't get so down so often, and it makes me tolerable to live with.",7,22
Lamictal,I thought it worked really well at first but I started getting a rash so I stopped now withdrawal is hard,2,19
Lamictal,"I could not tell a difference in myself while taking this medication . To me, a major side effect was hair loss.",3,22

Lamictal,I've been on this medicine for almost 4 months and it has worked wonders on stabilizing my mood. No more deep dark depression no more crazy manic episodes. I take 150mg in the morning and I have no side effects at all! This is a great medicine for me!,9,43
Lamictal,"I've been on a low dose, 25mg for about 3 weeks, then upped it to 50mg then will go to 100mg in 14 days.  I think this will be sufficient as it is working already and my moods are great, still able to feel stress and recognize the importance of that.  But, I am very forgetful of little details, which is irritating at work because of course it affects my project output.  It was fine with the lower dose so I'll ride it out and see how I adjust.  Other than that, I love it, it has helped me with a major crisis and was able to keep it together.  Thank you!",10,27
Lamictal,"I have been on Lamictal for almost 2 years. I've tried various anti-depressants to help stabilize my mood disorder, but those always seemed to make my depressive episodes worse. Lamictal gave me back my personality. I've recently lost my insurance, and cannot afford my Lamictal, and I've rapidly noticed my moods changing once again. It's a horrible feeling once I've discovered what it was like to not have constant mood changes... Lamictal is a wonderful mood stabilizer!",9,44
Lamictal,I've been taking lamotrigine along with bupropion for ten weeks. It wasn't until around 8 weeks that I could say without a doubt that the medication is working. Strenuous exercise helps to relieve the depression and control mania.,10,36
Lamictal,"BEST ever! Been on most medicines for rapid cycle bipolar disease. This works with 1 dose daily, and only occasionally something else is needed.  Great medicine, no side effects for me.",0,36
Lamictal,"Lamictal works great for my bipolar, but has caused some vision changes.",9,24
Lamictal,"The best medicine of the ones that I have tried. I still think I'm wacky. I have been losing my hair though, it's obvious when I take a shower or brush my hair. My spouse noticed my hair loss too. I guess the question is would I rather lose my hair or my mind?",9,61
Lamictal,Seen the best results in mood and energy level upon adding this drug two years ago. A huge relief after 10 years of struggling to find a medication regime that worked long-term with minimal  side-effects.,9,34
Lamictal,"Lamictal has been a lifesaving mood stabilizer for me. The only serious downside is that it causes what I call 'old lady skin'- thin, fragile, and poor healing, as well as mucous membrane fragility.  I initially did very well on 200 mg and suddenly developed severe rash eight months in (rare for it to take that long). I successfully (and slowly) rechallenged, and 200mg is where the skin issues kick in. I'm back down to 150mg and my slow-healing bug bites from the summer are finally fading away! HOWEVER, even if I had skin like the Crypt Keeper for the rest of my days, I can't praise Lamictal enough. It gave me my life back. What's a little skin in exchange?",9,64
Lamictal,"I've been taking Lamictal for my bipolar I disorder for almost a year and I've never been happier. It has changed my life so drastically. I went from living on an emotional rollercoster of rage and outbursts to being in control of my emotions and behaving responsibly. Unfortunately, the medication has caused me to get a disorder called Neutropenia, which is an abnormally low white blood cell count. This means that I've become more susceptible to disease and infection. This has been very difficult and frustrating news because up until this point I was praising Lamictal as a miracle drug and now I'm forced to get off the drug due to the Neutropenia. I'm very nervous that my bipolar symptoms will return once I am off this drug.",9,55
Lamictal,"I had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I had previously taken depression medicines of which none of them did any good. I have been on this medicine for about 2 1/2 months. I consider it a God-send. This medicine had changed my life, I could not imagine how much of change I am now living. The medicine has stopped my compulsive addictions. I am no longer a slave to my mind and obsessions that used to control my life. I am totally grateful for this medicine and its benefits.",0,62
Lamictal,"Tried it for over 4 weeks. I didn't feel any different and seemed to get sicker the longer I was on it. Never got the rash but had pain all over my body (bones, arms, legs, stomach, etc). It was so bad I couldn't get out of bed without crying and being in severe pain. Wound up in the hospital and after being off of it for just over 2 days I was back to normal!",1,39
Lamictal,"I have been taking lamictal for about 2 or 3 months. I still find myself occasionally hearing things and depressed but not as bad as I used to do. I also take Abilify, buspirone for anxiety, mirtazapine to sleep and eat. I think I am bipolar 1, I am not sure, but I am more stable think I used to be. I am able to concentrate more though and I give that to lamotrigine (lamictal). I wish I could gain weight I am too skinny.",6,27
Lamictal,"I have just started on Lamictal last month and I'm currently ramping up in small increments without any problems.  I seem to be more solid in my decisions and moods already and have found it helpful in conjunction with my other medicines which include Pristiq, Invega, and Klonopin.  I have noticed a slight increase in weight which I will have to watch carefully.  All in all, I think it is a positive addition to my regimen.",9,20
Lamictal,"I took this medication for about a year with an antidepressant. The combination kept me from suicidal episodes. Unfortunately, the itching was constant and became intolerable so I stopped taking it. Nothing else comparable to the benefits of Lamictal.",8,30
Lamictal,This medication gave me STEVENS-JOHNSONS SYNDROME,1,61
Lamictal,"Great medicine.  I take it only in the morning at a low dosage - it's a bit of an upper and helps my brain work better and faster.  Probably no good for bipolars on the high energy side.  It's therapeutic, too - unlike lithium it's there working all the time.  Wouldn't take it at night, and something to wind down from it is helpful.  No side effects besides lunchtime headaches, a little extra clumsiness and mixing up words sometimes when I'm speaking or typing.",10,47
Lamictal,I feel better. I like it.,9,19
Lamictal,Lamictal saved my life.  The manic issues were getting severe and I had no way of handling these issues. I have no side effects and I have my life back.  I enjoy life again.,10,50
Lamictal,"After reading this forum, I cried.  For more than fifteen years, mania and depression were tearing me apart.  Lamictal seems to have changed this.  I notice a major difference.  Those around me notice as well. People are no longer afraid of me. I have had no side effects.  This drug has saved my life.",10,215
Lamictal,This medicine changed my life.  I call it my miracle drug.  If it weren't for this drug I would never have made it back to the person I used to be before the diagnosis.  I'm only 19 years old but it's made such a huge impact on my life during the 4 years I have been taking it. I don't have to worry anymore if I will ever be like I was before.  This drug works and without it who knows where I'd be today.,10,62
Lamictal,"I was given Lamictal after a long period of trial and error with other medicines. Lamictal was wonderful, but much to my dismay I did experience severe side effects. When I went up to 200mgs a day I began to break out with hives from head to toe, eventually hands, feet, and face began to swell. Was finally taken off of it in ER. I truly wish this hadn't happened, with Lamictal the horrible outbursts of anger ceased to occur and I finally felt normal. I hope my doctor can put me on something that works as well as Lamictal. I am afraid to end up like I was.",8,51
Lamictal,"I was consumed with depression, anxiety, fear, rage, and compulsive behavior since I entered puberty. I was sent to psychologists who could not help me because my issues were entirely chemical. After years of failed treatment, I self-medicated with alcohol which landed me in jail. I finally went to a psychiatrist who put me on Lamictal. I am a healthy, peaceful, and productive person for the first time in my life. I know I would not be here if it were not for this medication. Other than severe dehydration, after 3 years I have experienced no adverse effects.",10,244
Lamictal,"Lamictal is a great drug for me, except for the side effects. I now have had to be put on sleep medicines or I stay awake all night. I have also lost quite a lot of hair over the years of taking it. At one point (400mg) per day. Now at 200mg a day, it has not been as bad, but still significant. My memory has gotten almost to the point of giving up the medicine because it's so bad. I also have trouble thinking of words that I want to say and have never had that problem until taking Lamictal.  It does have less or (better) side effects than some of the others, or I would have tried something else by now.",8,76
Lamictal,Prior to taking Lamictal I was constantly battling bouts of extreme depression and insane manic episodes. I thought I would never have any hope of leading a productive successful life. I have been taking it for 8 months now and it gave me life. Amazing. I highly recommend this medicine to anyone struggling with bipolar disorder. I've experienced no side effects. You must be patient through it's inductive stage so stick with it for at least a month.,10,116
Lamictal,I have used this since the first tests for its use in treating bipolar and it has worked and never lost its ability to help stabilize my moods (I have tried other medicines with significantly less success).,10,30
Lamictal,This medicine saved my life. I have been on it for at least 10 years. After taking several types of medicines that really didn't work I was put on this and the results for me are wonderful. I am taking Prozac and Zyprexa too. I am not as easily upset and have more control of my emotions. I feel more human.,10,45
Lamictal,"Lamictal completely changed my life from the roller coaster high dosage of Depakote to a much more stable controllable life with just a little dizziness and drowziness, which has since gone away.",8,34
Lamictal,"Lamictal has done so much good for me, especially now that it's being combined with a low dose of Zoloft. I'm not depressed, I'm not manic. I'm just content with life now. My only complaint is that it can reduce the effectiveness of the birth control pill. The risk of pregnancy is a non-issue for me right now, but in the future, I really don't want to take that risk. But overall, I'm very happy with it.",9,28
Lamictal,"I've been on Lamictal for a couple of months now, only up to 100mg, but I just stopped taking it due to the severe headaches I've been getting from it. Just a heads-up as one of the potential side effects.",4,49
Lamictal,It saved my life and lives of others I came in contact with at times.,10,43
Lamictal,"I have Bipolar 1 with psychotic features and have taken Lamictal for years. It is a great medication to control the symptoms of my mental illness. I had no unsavory side effects and my mood has remained pretty level. My doctor does adjust the amount that I take throughout the year, as needed.",10,64
Lamictal,Lamital works great but side effect for me is weight gain. I have been using it for two years. To counteract the weight gain I was put on Prozac. It helped to lose the weight but other side effects caused me to discontine it.,7,36
Lamictal,Simply put Lamictal saved my life and NO side effects either.,10,75
Lamictal,"After suffering a year long depressive episode and many different medicines, I tried Lamictal.  It has been a God-send. I take 200mg once a day.  I also take Lithium 600mg twice a day, with Lexapro 20mg once a day and Klonopin 0.5mg, 4 times a day.",10,33
Lamictal,This worked wonders for me.  Seasonal adjustment may be needed as it is with me.,8,79
Lamictal,"Started on this 6 months ago.  My own personal miracle drug.  I had never known peace or stability before Lamictal.  I hope to stay on it forever, and also hope it continues working this well.",10,106
Lamictal,"I have to honestly say that my prescribed drug works for me. I do not experienece the excessive anger, compulsive highs and excessive OCD. I was never a really depressive person but was not able to think clearly thus making poor decisions. I tried several anti-depressants for many years which caused all kinds of medical imbalances. I came across lamictal when I went cold turkey off lexapro and almost commited suicide. That was the darkest moment of my life. Now, I am happier and balanced. I never knew life could be this good. I also eat right, limit cocktails, exercise and get good rest to aid in my balanced lifestyle.",10,157
Lamictal,I have been on Lamictal for 7 months now.  I noticed a drastic difference when the medication hit full potency.  It was like night and day.  I am still scared to death I might have a low.  I don't think I could make it through another.,10,79
Lamictal,I have been taking Lamictal for only 1 month and I notice a huge difference. I am finding joy in the things that I couldn't for years. My patience is so much better and the outbursts of anger have stopped already. I only hope that I don't start experiencing the side effects that I have heard about.,10,166
Lamictal,I have taken Lamictal for over two years now and I have noticed an extremely huge change in my outbursts of rage. I also take Paxil CR and these combined have helped me out a lot. A warning to those taking Paxil: DO NOT allow yourself to run out of medication.,10,30
Lamictal,"Wonderful.  I've tried other drugs for bipolar and never knew what stable was until I was prescribed lamotrigine. I'm more productive, and my Seroquel has been reduced from 1000mg a day to 600mg a day. Great medicine.",9,36
Lamictal,"Lamictal is one of the best drugs I've ever been on. It has been amazing. Being on it has made me feel so much more level. Before taking it I never really knew how I was going to feel or how much things would affect me. I am currently on Lamictal in addition to many other medications, but adding Lamictal made me so much more sure of my emotions. I felt so much safer. It has really been wonderful.",10,79
Lamictal,"I was worried that Lamictal would make me boring or unable to be creative, but the opposite is true. I have much more control of my thoughts and behavior, but not too much control. My memory has gotten a lot better too, even though that's not listed as a side effect.",10,147
Lamictal,"This medicine along with wellbutrin has stabilized me and helped me become happy again. I've also quit taking anything for ADD. Compared to what I've experienced while bipolar, most difficulties I have, now seem trivial. Just keep trying every day and when you feel like giving up tell yourself you haven't even started to fight. Keep a sense of humor about things too.",10,128
Lamictal,"I have bipolar disorder and have been using Lamictal for 3 months. No more thoughts of suicide, no anger and I am happy again. I am back to being me again.",10,206
Lamictal,"I began taking Lamictal for lower body spasticity due to an injury to my CNS. My neurologist decided to try Lamictal in order to prevent these seizure-like episodes from occurring daily, and it worked; however, it made an even bigger impact on my mental and emotional state. At 19, I've dealt with depression, severe anxiety, and irritability for approximately 5 years now, and the stability I gained from taking this medication (for convulsions!) has absolutely changed my life.",10,90
Lamictal,"I have been on medication for 9 years now. I have tried over 30 medications for my bipolar, axiety, PTSD and have found Lamictal as the only medication that helped me.  I am very medication sensitive so I did get the rash with Lamictal and still took it for 4 years until the rash ended up being to much.  I have now tried 6 more medications and have not found any that help without huge side effects.  I would say it was a miracle medication for me and I truly miss it.",9,151
Lamictal,"I can't praise this drug highly enough. At the age of 59, I'm finally leading a level life - without quiting jobs in a rage, moving my family 1,400 miles to a house I'd never seen. Due to troubles with sleeping, I also take Seroquel.",10,171
Lamictal,I take this medication for bipolar. it is the only thing that has worked for me. i am so very thankful i came across this because it makes me normal and i can live my life with my husband like a normal person...,10,123
Lamictal,I have had Bipolar Disorder for over 15 years and have had seven hospital admissions.  I was put on Lamictal about 4 years ago when I had a transplant as my previous meds interacted with my anti- rejection drug. Lamictal is the best medication for Bipolar Disorder I have ever been on.  Since I've been taking it my mood has been very stable and I feel like I have all my normal emotions back.  I've also kept out of hospital even with all the stress of my physical problems and no side effects.,9,131
Lamictal,I have been taking Lamictal for almost two months. It has worked great for my Bipolar Disorder. It at first gave me severe stomach pains with diarrhea that subsided after a week or so. I noticed I'm more sensitive to foods now. Like for example I cannot eat tomato products anymore (I used to be allergic when I was younger). And also greasy foods make me very sick (which may be due to my gallbladder removal). But over all good results from this drug!,9,28
Lamictal,"Im up to 200mg per day, and honestly, I really dont know how much its helping me.  I seem to be a lot better, but I think the Clonopin does a lot more for me.",5,59
Lamictal,"It keeps me very stable. My only gripes are that there's a really bitter taste if it gets stuck to your tongue, the shape is ridiculous to swallow (It's like a pentagon lol) and my psychiatrist didn't know that there is more and more info coming out that suggests that it interacts with the birth control pill. My little one is 2 weeks old and she definitely wasn't planned. I took the pill perfectly too. Just a heads up :)",10,103
Lamictal,"I didn't realize until i read these reviews why i was itching..but now i know!  thanks.  for the past two months while using this medicine i have definitely been focused on happier things and my day to day life as opposed to thinking constant thoughts of death and being overwhelemed with fear.  no side effects like i had with so many other drugs, and i tried them all.  so i am thankful my dr. recommended this to me.  everyone should try it.",10,40
Lamictal,have been taking lamictal for two months and this drug has had NO side effects whatsoever.  has erased all thoughts of constant fear of death and scariness from my life every day that were consuming me for no reason.  am NOT depressed but had consuming fear.  i feel reborn and have tried anti depressants before that have not worked..many of them.  this is definitely a mood stabilizer at it's best.,0,263
Lamictal,I'm bipolar with severe depression &amp; anxiety attacks.  I've been on Lamictal for 2 yrs.  Since then my anxiety attacks have almost stopped.  I do not have the rages of anger like I used to.  Lamictal has hugely made my life better.,9,338
Lamictal,"I find that taking Lamictal has made my condition of bipolar disorder has made me feel better about myself and influenced my ambitions.It is a wonderful drug and has kept me from having any suicidal thoughts, which I have had in the past.The only thing that is irritable about the drug is itching.It drives me a little crazy but I feel a lot better, and I am glad to tell everyone about it.",5,40
Lamictal,"I have severe bipolar disorder. I was extremely depressed. My Dr. put me on Lamictal and within a few days I started to feel much, much better. I still had problems with the depression, but it made it a little more tolerable. I now recieve ECT, and am taking Lamictal and I am doing better than I have in a long time. It also didnt have some of the terrible side effects that I had with the other meds used for BPD. I am very grateful to have found this medication to help me.",0,54
Latuda,"Latuda 80 mg made me so manic that I could not lay still in bed. I did not understand what was happening. I told the Dr and he tried to add more drugs. I rejected most of them as I felt worse or unable to function on them. I was not sleeping well and felt empty, emotionless, like a zombie   After 7 months of this awfulness on 80 mg Latuda, I became manic and psychotic, developed extreme paranoia, was not sleeping  and tried to end my life.  Dr. switched me to Quatiapine and things got better. .",1,2
Latuda,"I might have bipolar, but I have definitely got bad depression that goes very low and very dark. I have been on everything and I get a little relief with a small does of Wellbutrin 100 mg, but anymore and I cry. I started taking Latuda and for the first three days it was great! I felt nauseous for two days, but day three was awesome! Then I realized I was not sleeping, so my doctor added trazodone. Even with the trazodone I could not sleep during the night, plus, the trazodone made me a zombie during the day! I quit the trazodone and changed the times of the Latuda to day and still couldnt sleep! Last night I didnt take anything and I finally slept  Today Ive felt nauseous all day! My doctor sent me message;  You hav a  history of depression, lets just stay on it and see.  Not sure what to do? Im also hypothyroid, have got fibromyalgia and PTSD from the army. I just dont know what to do?",3,3
Latuda,"I was on Latuda for nearly a year, I was on 60mg dose. Starting this medication was a battle. I would have severe nausea but I would ignore it and take other meds for it. Recently though the side effects are only increasing and I no longer feel the same as I did a year ago.",2,1
Latuda,"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder pretty young, and have been having voices and intense paranoia since I was 13. I didn't get proper treatment for it until I was 18 (teenage stupidity, and all that), and now I am on 120 mg of latuda, 500 mg of lamictal, and 900 mg of gabapentin and I finally feel some relief. I don't have voices anymore. I don't feel scared to go to bed because I think someone is going to kill me. I finally think that I'm a real person. This medication is a literal lifesaver. I have taken many antipsychotics, seroquel, zyprexa, risperadal, and abilify, as well as half a dozen antidepressants since I was a little kid, nothing has worked.  I do not care though, as I finally can think clearly for the first time in my life. I have had some problems with anxiety during taking this med, but I was diagnosed with panic disorder + generalized anxiety disorder long ago. I have not experienced any negative side effects  and I have gained no weight. In fact, I have lost 60 lbs",10,3
Latuda,"I started taking Latuda a year ago for my bipolar type 1. I was so depressed, I was unable to do absolutely do anything that I stopped working and had horrible social anxiety. I started with 20mg and went as high as 60 mg. I am now stable with Latuda 40mg and 10mg of Prozac. I feel myself again. I know have the energy to do anything, my anxiety is gone, I can sleep, and I genuinely feel happy. The side effects I felt at first was restlessness and feeling extremely tired and subtle headaches. Now, I usually get tired within 2 hours. I sometimes get panic attacks every 3 months or so. I have lost weight on the medication and finally have energy to workout. I've lost 30 pounds since taking the medicine. Overall, this has worked for me.",10,15
Latuda,"Friend was clinical depression, bipolar was out on this drug approximately 2 months ago. Seriously affected sleep. Committed suicide a week ago. Common doctors. Monitor your patients.",1,16
Latuda,"I really don't know what to say. I've been on Latuda 40mg for two months and I don't see much of a difference between 40mg and 20mg. I tried a higher dose but I experience restlessness and anxiety. Now, I am so irritable and my panic attacks have return. I'm not sure what my doctor has in mind, but we are trying to control the panic attacks right now, and find a way to help me sleep throughout the night.",4,13
Latuda,First major depression in 1980. Tried first psych med in 1991. Diagnosed bipolar. Taken over 30 meds for treatment resistant depression.  Put on 40mg latuda in psych ward this last September.  This med lifted a veil that had been obscuring who I was for decades.  Overly emotional sometimes. Aware of new feelings and emotions. Desire intimacy from wife often.  Have addressed a couple of serious character flaws I was oblivious to. Active and not in bed all day.  Working on dose with psychiatrist still. Using lamictal for moods and gabapentin for anxiety. Latuda addressed the treatment resistant depression.  I feel that once I clean up the wreckage of my past I can move on and begin a whole new life. I only have about 35 years left so I will make it count. Hard to believe that one little pill could do all of that.,10,51
Latuda,Well it's been almost a week and starting to feel something,3,10
Latuda,This drug Latuda is awful. First its expensive. Then it doesn't even work. I have been on this drug trying to tolerate its side effects for 3 years. Maybe it worked a little at first but now it is just a myriad of side effects and SIX other drugs to try and do what the latuda is supposed to do.,1,8
Latuda,"Ive had much trouble with medication in past and was finally diagnosed with treatment resistant bipolar. Latuda has seem to be the only medication to help me. Within days it improved my mood, I went from lying in bed for hours unable to move because I was so depressed to getting up early every morning and walking a few miles. I felt so lifted, and it was the greatest feeling. Unfortunately though after a few months it would just stop working, but when my dosage was upped Id go back to feeling good again. It could be due to my treatment resistant, but that and weight gain are the only issues Ive had with Latuda. Unfortunately I have gained a lot of weight on this medication, but I dont struggle with depressive episodes, mood instability, or suicidal thoughts anymore.",7,33
Latuda,The first thing I want to say is that latuda totally works and it changed my life so much for the better. The second thing I will say is that it made me gain weight. I started putting the weight on as soon as I started taking it and altogether have put on about 50 lb.,10,27
Latuda,"I've been on Llatuda for about 5 days for bipolar (20mg). All I can say is that I have a myriad of issues, thyroid, fybromyalgia, bipolar, just to name a few. This medication works so well for me! I had tried so many of the other meds throughout my lifetime. This is one medication that I could quickly tell, was helping me a lot. I had severe apathy and could have cared less if I'd wake up in the morning. Now, I actually feel like getting some things done (usually I do not have enough time) I felt HOPELESS before this drug. It feels nice to get up again and start my day.",10,29
Latuda,My husband was diagnosed with bi-polar depression.  Many other underlying issues over the years but was put  on Latuda 3-4 weeks.  Then he started hearing voices &amp; committed suicide.  He was so agitated on it.,1,34
Latuda,"I have been on Latuda about 4 months now  for major depression and it has changed my life! I struggled severely with suicidal thoughts and actions as well as self harm. Since getting on Latuda, my suicidal thoughts are completely gone. I think more rationally again, I dont feel a need to harm or dislike myself, I finally feel like I have control of my illness. The only downside is the price, but thankfully I was able to get my insurance to help cover it. Also Latuda is known for lots of possible side effects. For me, I get severely nauseous if I take it after not eating enough. But it is definitely worth the benefits. Latuda is truly a miracle drug!!",9,28
Latuda,I was prescribed this medication to treat bipolar depression. At first it seemed to improve the mood swings but from day one I experienced severe akathisia and anxiety. I would take it at night and every time I did it would ruin my night. I tried to be patient with it for months but it ultimately landed me in the ER with the first panic attack I've ever had in my life. Even the ER told me to stop taking it immediately. I'm glad I did as I've felt much better since being off of it and trying something else. It's also insanely expensive which makes it even more frustrating.,1,17
Latuda,"20 mg, bipolar depression - was happy to be on this med for about 1.5 yrs. I had a healthy routine, went to therapy, was building my life and thriving. Eventually I began to feel very uncomfortable, like my dose was too high? Taken nightly, I could feel it kick up... always within a couple hours I would feel so unlike myself, sad, on edge,  uncomfortable seemingly without a cause. I began to go to bed immediately, otherwise I would be up with intrusive thoughts begging for the discomfort to end Withdrawal Period - I came off, cold turkey, and suffered a long adjustment period. no period, 6 months of pretty intense depression, and UNABLE TO EAT. I took 15 mins to force down a spoon of peanut butter every morning.... became desperate and went back on the med because I thought I needed it to function, but really I just needed to make it a little longer through withdrawals. expensive, ask around for coupons Good luck everybody",5,14
Latuda,This medication is over 1200.00 a month. Who can afford that.  Absolutely ridiculous.,0,32
Latuda,"This medication was a lifesaver for me, it was the first one I've tried that helped - initially had no side effects. I have bipolar but only experience depression, so most medications don't work for me. This was different. I took 20mg for about a year, and then my depression got worse out of no where so we increased my dose gradually to 80mg. Then I started experiencing oculogyric crises ( when your eyes involuntary look upwards). And they are the most terrifying, awful side effect I've experienced in my life. Now I've dropped back to 20mg and it's still happening. It is so horrible that it is making me not want to live. I think I have to discontinue the medication altogether, though I'm terrified the side effect will continue since it never used to happen on 20mg either. A year ago I would have rated this a 10/10. But this side effect is bad enough for me to rate it a 1. If you are on this and it is working for you, please be very hesitant to raise your dose. I wish I had stayed on 20, this might have never happened.",1,24
Latuda,"Latuda has been a game changer for me. I am a functioning highly anxious super bipolar human. I have taken a lot of different meds over the years including Seroquel, Lamictal, Zyprexa, and Risperdal, all of which caused extreme fatigue and minor weight gain. Since taking Latuda, the little bit of weight came off and my mood has mostly stabilized. The only downside to this that I have found is that if I take it on an empty stomach in the a.m. and skip breakfast, nausea and vomiting is almost a guaranteed. Sometimes I'm not in the mood to eat when I wake up but meh. Take it at night I guess to avoid that. I would recommend Latuda to anyone with Bipolar disorder as it has brought me many positive changes.",9,41
Latuda,"I had tried several medications for bipolar disorder and they either made my symptoms worse or caused severe side effects. Latuda has been a miracle for my bipolar, I am stable now and there are no side effects.",10,27
Latuda,"Latuda has been an incredible experience for me. I have been taking it for some time before I was even diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and have a myriad of mental health problems that are moderate to quite severe. Latuda puts a stop to a majority of my symptoms at 120mg (max dose), and those it doesnt eliminate it makes very manageable. No partner drugs (yet), and no  awful side effects. I have recently come across the issue of the cost of the medication and have struggled incredibly because of it. Im going to be able to take it again starting at 20mg and Im still ecstatic to have my life back, because Latuda works for me time and time again after missed doses or periods of time where it has been unavailable to me. I would recommend this to anyone who struggles with bipolar/psychosis.",10,29
Latuda,"I am diagnosed with bipolar depression, anxiety, and OCD I had to get off zyprexa because it was causing too much weight gain. I was really hoping latuda would work because I was just so tired of this rough journey of trying so many meds! When I started Latuda I started feeling super awake, weird,  in a manic state, and all in all just an uncomfortable feeling. My brain couldnt focus on doing any school work at ALL. So if youre taking this around school be careful! On the bright side, it did bring my my sexual libido back (after it being taken away by zyprexa). I got off latuda immediately because I was just so uncomfortable on it. Now I am on lithium, prozac, and lamictal and everything has gotten better. Good luck and keep going- Latuda may work for you like many others, so consider trying it!!!",2,17
Latuda,This medication Laltuda is the ONLY thing that has worked for my depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. I thought I was treatment resistant because I'd had terrible luck with psych meds and nothing else had had any effect on my mood or thinking (aside from anti convulsants having a horrific cognitive dulling effect on me) but this lifted me out of depression at 40mg instantly (20mg had no effect). Decided to stop taking it after about 3 months due to nausea and restlessness caused by it (not severe enough to call it akathisia though) but I will not be afraid to return to it if I ever need to get out of a depressive episode quickly.,10,15
Latuda,"I was prescribed Latuda 20mg for type 2 Bipolar to help with the depression side. I was having suicidal ideations before starting Latuda. The first month it help with my depression and I give it credit for that. However after a month of using it, it stopped working. I had moments of sadness here and there not as deep. They increased the dose to 40mg. At 40mg I wasn't sad but I was extremely irritable and angry. I stopped taking Latuda because I would rather be sad than so very angry at everyone and everything for no reason.",5,22
Latuda,I take 60mg of Latuda a day. Been on it for 3 months now. Ive gained a lot of weight &amp; every time I take it I get super tired two hours afterwards. Other than that I feel AMAZING. Ive suffered from bipolar disorder since I was 12 years old. I also have extreme paranoia with my bipolar but with my PRN I dont have to fight my mind anymore. This has set my mood so straight I dont feel like spending $200 on shoes when I need to pay bills &amp; I dont sit in my house for weeks wanting my life to end. I havent had a mental breakdown in months &amp; I am so happy I found this drug. Although its kind of expensive &amp; making me chunky. Lol,9,34
Latuda,"I was hospitalized after a suicide attempt and while inpatient I was put on this in combination with my other medication (Prazosin, Lexapro, Lamictal). On the upside, I wasn't depressed. But I was very restless, irritable and just downright angry all of the time - sometimes seething.  I recommend it if, like me, your bipolar depression seems to be untouched but be very careful if you're a naturally irritable person.",0,18
Latuda,"I have bipolar type ii and severe OCD. The bipolar depressive episodes I have had are absolutely the worst, most painful experiences in my life. Honestly, Latuda has been a miracle drug for me. Since the 3 week point I have felt absolutely nothing short of what I assume to be normal. I have to take Prozac for my OCD, which had been causing me to rapid cycle for nearly a year, but Latuda and Prozac have been working wonders together to help me keep my grades up and myself in school. My friends and loved ones can see the visible positive difference Latuda has made in my life. I experience extreme somnolence as a side effect from this drug, and am trying really hard to find things to counteract it. So far, that's the only negative side effect I've had.  I had to get a drug exemption form to get insurance to cover it. Everyone is different, but my experience has been absolutely wonderful.",9,20
Latuda,"I should note that I have a bipolar diagnosis, but do not have it in a traditional sense. I've never had a mania/hypomania episode, but I have only ever responded to bipolar medications and not SSRI's. I also have ptsd, aspergers, and atypical anorexia. I've been working hard in my recovery from my eating disorder, and behaviorally, I was in a good place but was still finding myself having overwhelming emotional spells that would throw off my entire week. My Dr suggested adding a low dose of Latuda (20mg). He gave me a sample, and said to email him in a week. It seemed like nearly overnight my symptoms improved. In treatment three days later (a group program), a group leader commented that she had never seen me so calm before. I thought it might even just be a placebo effect that would wear off, but for the past month and a half things have stayed good. I haven't had any noticeable side effects, and my anxiety and re actability have both decreased dramatically.",0,15
Latuda,"I first took Latuda when I was severely suicidal with a bipolar disorder and  it changed me overnight.  I went off because my creatine level went up and it might have been the cause.  Then I was on three other meds that didn't work as well.  Now I'm back on Latuda after years of mild depression while being treated and in a fog unable to think and sleeping 10 to 12 hours a day.  Again, after a week of 20mg then 40mg I am feeling great.  Thank you Latuda and thank you Veterans Administration for paying for it.",10,22
Latuda,This drug in 2019 costs $1200 for a 30 day supply. Not worth the price! Consider Olanzapine + Prozac combination as an alternative. Personally I felt like it reduces my energy or motivation and maybe made me a little happier but I don't know for sure because I wasn't on it for long.,0,12
Latuda,"Going on Latuda (40mg)  I had no side effects to speak of, I suffered from crippling depression for most of my life. I am Bipolar. My dr put me on the 80mg dose after I was having break through symptoms. Latuda has been fine for me, I think it works along with my other meds. Im going to be upping the dose to 120mg next but there is a huge caution of high doses over a long period of time. This concerns me, as I think Latuda is a good drug for me. But for how long?",9,20
Latuda,"I started out taking 40mg. Things were going okay for a week. I was restless and my mind was racing but I wasn't depressed and to me that was what mattered. But then the psych brought me up to 60, then 80mg. My mind was racing, I was having anxiety attacks, I couldn't sit still, I was having random outbursts of crying.... I did not feel like myself, and I felt so much worse than I did unmedicated. I went back down to 40mg but still felt terrible and off. I was afraid to be alone because I was so low. I've been off it for about a week now and I feel like me again for the first time in what feels like forever. I can finally just chill out without the restlessness and racing mind. My emotions are coming back (latuda made me extremely flat). Latuda may work for you, but it didn't for me.",2,22
Latuda,"I never heard of Restless Legs Syndrome till been on Latuda for 6 months. I have bipolar and after taking 40 mg for two months increasing to 80 mg and then dropping to 40 mg after 5 episodes of restless legs, developed worse depression and insomnia  I ever experienced, had to stop taking Latuda after 6th episode of worse Restless Legs Syndrome. After 4 hours of another Restless Legs Syndrome torture crying  on the floor husband drove me to the hospital.",4,13
Latuda,"I took Latuda for about 8 months for Bipolar. In that time I gained 30 pounds and became suicidal. I was depressed before I took it, but it brought me to a whole new level. I had to get Electroconvulsive Therapies to come out of my depression with this drug. I am only now two years later losing all the weight I gained on Latuda, and am struggling immensely to keep it off. It messes with your metabolism a lot and permanently, and doesnt help bipolar symptoms. It makes them worse.",1,23
Latuda,"I have been on Latuda since it first came out onto the market. Before Latuda, I had several  suicide attempts, and had been on many medications. The result, of my progress, was almost instantly, after I started taking the Latuda. I truly believe that the Latuda is what has helped me become stable. It seems that it was almost instantly I saw positive results from starting the Latuda. The ruminating thoughts had slowed down enough that I could soon focus on what I was thinking and doing. With having my focus back, I could then place my thoughts on getting better. With having the control of my thoughts again, I have been able to live a productive life. I truly feel and believe it is my starting the  Latuda that saved my life. Thank you so much!",10,26
Latuda,Prescribed for bipolar irritability. Worked within a day or two. Possibly gained weight from it. No complaints.,10,11
Latuda,"I started taking it yesterday (40mg) and about 30 minutes after taking it, I felt I had to keep moving and could not sit still. I thought this was a weird feeling so I looked up side effects and one of the effects is  inability to keep still . I absolutely hate this feeling. Maybe I have to get used to it but I will try it for the next 2 weeks. If I still feel the same every time I take it, I will ask to for a different medication.",3,23
Latuda,"When I started off I was on a very low-dose of Latuda. And it was horrible. I felt like I just needed to jump out of my skin and my anxiety was so high I couldnt even leave my house. And then finally my doctor put me on 120 mg of Latuda and it has been amazing so far. Ive gained about 15 pounds and I feel sluggish 90% of the time. When I talk to my doctor about the dose that I am now on, he mentioned that most psychiatrists feel a low-dose would be best for patients but then they are starting to realize that a higher dose of Latuda is best for the patient. There is no tolerance build up for this medication. And so I recommend that if you have any issues regarding taking Latuda that you ask your psychiatrist about the dosage. Because for each person and theres a magic number.",10,12
Latuda,"I have only just started Latuda for Bipolar I, it's been 4 days. I was previously on Abilify for 1 month and the side effects were horrible for me, I was restless, had blurred vision, was depressed, headaches etc from day 1. My Psychiatrist switched me from the abilify to Latuda 40mg and I feel really good so far, I have no side effects at all except mild sleepiness, and I feel very consistent within myself. I would give It 10/10 but as I said it's only been 4 days, so don't want to get my hopes up. But so far so good! I still feel a little down sometimes, but have none of the side effects I did with Abilify, so I'm hoping with time I will have even more improvement. I'm so thankful as I couldn't survive another day on Abilify. Latuda seems to be what works for me. I hope you all find what works for you!",8,14
Latuda,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, anxiety, and OCD last year. I came off of Zyprexa to try Latuda and that was a pretty bad decision because Zyprexa did wonders (the weight gain became an issue). I took Latuda with 75 mg Lamictal and 30 mg Prozac. The first week of Latuda (went from 20 mg to 40 mg) I felt soo hyper, unproductive, not focused on school work and just uncomfortable. My obsessions got worse too. But I did NOT feel depressed at all, so that was good. I started losing a couple of pounds and got my libido back. After taking the pill at night I was super nauseous, wanted to puke (but ginger ale helped a lot) and felt sleepy through out the WHOLE day. I finally got off of it after a week. Try to go into trying Latuda with an open mind and it may work for you. Also, with my insurance I paid $70 for a bottle of 15 pills. Pretty expensive !!",3,10
Latuda,"I'm the type to lurk the review section and man... I never thought I would be one of those people to actually review a medication. This medication completely ruined me, it really did. I consider this medication to be the evil, it made everything worse. I stopped taking it about a week ago and I'm still recovering, I'm still horribly suicidal. Yep that's right, this medication made me suicidal. I've been having mental breakdowns every single day because of how this medication made me feel. I'm waiting for my brain to go back to its original working order. It just messed up my entire view of life and I regret ever putting this horrible medication into my body. This experience has scarred me for life and I will never forget it, it has truly messed me up. I got the horrible Akathisia side effect and this medication really tested the limits of me mentally. I can barely sleep anymore I'm sorry if I scared you, but this is just only my experience. Best of luck to you",1,35
Latuda,"BPD1 runs on my fathera side. For years I was treated with SSRIs and benzos for anxiety and depression. 3 yrs ago I was diagnosed with ADHD (early 40s). I kept feeling sadness, lack of motivation, irritability, etc. On a whim, I took a test for BPD1, 2, and 3-cyclothymia and showed the results to my doctor. I took a separate test during my appointment and scored high. I was put on 20mg Latuda only a few days ago but I swear can tell a difference. Some of it may be psychosomatic, but I am so very pleased. This medicine is so smooth. I dont feel drugged at all. I get sleepy at night when I take it (with food). A slight sensitivity to light and some minor blurred vision. I can carry on a conversation, complete tasks, and feel rested after waking up. Some ADHD symptoms mimic BP. My Vyvanse was cut in half (20mg to 10mg) but Latuda seems to help more than Vyvanse did in two years. Ill try to update in a month on how Im doing.",9,20
Latuda,"Ive literally only been on Latuda for 3 days and ever since I started taking it, my vision is messed up, I feel sick to my stomach, and emotionally I feel kind of numb. Not sure if these will go away but I start a new job soon so hopefully it gets better. Fingers crossed.",4,6
Latuda,Went on Latuda two weeks ago.  Doc switched me from quetiapine to 20mg of Latuda.  My mood has gotten progressively worse since the switch.   Calling Doc to get taken off of Latuda because the condition it's supposed to be treating is getting worse.,1,10
Latuda,I started Latuda 1 month ago Im  experiencing a lot of good weight loss. Before  I started off weighing 215lb now Im 204lb Im very happy and my mood is stabilizing.  Im truly happy. No more racing thoughts and now I can concentrate on my faith thank God..,8,20
Latuda,"I began taking Latuda several years ago and it has been the best treatment for my bipolar depression. It keeps my mood up without causing mania. However, the key for me was in the dosing. I have always been more sensitive to drugs than other people, side effects are stronger, some drugs knock me out, with surgeries, anesthesia always makes me vomit, etc. I take 40 mg of Latuda and it works best. My doctor increased it to 60 mg because it's closer to the therapeutic dose. That was too much for me. I was jittery, couldn't sit still, felt like a racing in my chest, it was a strange sensation. But when I went back down to 40mg, I was fine, and it's enough to treat my mood. If you're like me be careful of taking too much and find a doctor who is willing to listen about lowering doses. It works so well for me, my doctor gives me samples since I can't afford the high copays.",10,30
Latuda,"This drug definitely made me feel less crappy (and being on it allowed me to experience happiness more). That being said, it also drained my motivation in a manner similar to olanzapine and I couldn't sleep. I'm pretty sensitive to drugs - this was just from 2 days on 10mg Latuda and then a day and a half off of it. Maybe you will have a better time with it if you don't have trouble sleeping. Oh, also watch the price tag - if you're poor it might be more cost effective to use an SSRI. Talk to the doctor about the price.",3,10
Latuda,"I was already (And still am) prescribed Seroquel XR 400 mg for Bipolar 1 Disorder. Seroquel XR has been mostly a Godsend as it keeps me stable and prevents manic and racing thoughts, but only slightly affective with my Bipolar Depression. After playing with the Seroquel dosage and trying a bunch of antidepressants and Lamictal that made things worse, my doctor suggested adding on Latuda. I started on 20 mg of Latuda in August 2019 along with my Seroquel XR and didnt notice much. Then, about a month ago, she upped my dose of Latuda to 40 mg. That increase has made a HUGE difference in my life!! I am no longer thinking about my own death, and Im even reaching out to old friends whom Ive been avoiding. The nice thing about Latuda is it treats my depression without making me manic!!!! Latuda is truly a miracle drug for me. Since Im also taking the Seroquel XR, in my opinion, these two meds together have made me able to function and leave the house!!!!!!! Thank you!!",10,32
Latuda,"I've been on latuda for about 5 months. The first month it was fine but then everytime I took it I felt like I am going to jump out of my skin, my mom didnt think I was telling the truth but it almost feel like I'm dying its so uncomfy. The only thing I can do to stop it is go to sleep. But I don't want to sleep all day. I'm going to ask for new meds this week at the doctor.  I have given  it enough time to get the side effects to go away and it hasn't.",0,34
Latuda,"I was going through bipolar depression when I was first prescribed Latuda. This medication has changed my life. I was not depressed anymore and I could feel emotions and could think more clearly. I'm on 40mg of latuda, 100 mg of quetiepine and 100 mg of lamotrigine.",8,13
Latuda,When I took this medication Latuda I had muscle tremors and it made me feel off balance,0,19
Latuda,"TAKE LATUDA AT NIGHT BEFORE SLEEP!!! I've only been taking it for a week, but the first few days were extremely uncomfortable with massive drowsiness. UNTIL. Until I took it at night and then I really had no drowsiness during the day, which was a game changer for me, I got to be productive again. I hope the med works out for me, but I just wanted to share that right away as it really helped me.",5,37
Latuda,"I switched from 800 mg Seroquel to 40 mg Latuda.  At first it was ok but Latuda does NOT sit well with me. Once I finished the taper of Seroquel, the Latuda side effects came out.  1:  extreme insomnia: trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep. 2: restless leg syndrome, my legs hurt ALL the time. 3: nausea to the point where it would wake me up in the morning 4. just general restlessness, it felt like my mind was always running and I couldn't rest at all. Tapering down off it was also AWFUL. Going from 40 mg to 20 mg my body felt like it was shutting down. I had to take time off because I could barely walk, I was so nauseous, I was exhausted but couldn't sleep, my vision was swimming, and I felt like I was going to pass out any second. This went on for 2 days of torture and then became survivable enough for me to go back to work. Still suffering through the nausea and exhaustion and hoping that it will go away soon so I can finish off the taper.",4,21
Latuda,"I have been on Latuda for 4 years for bipolar depression. When I first started Latuda, I felt so much better almost immediately. It worked fine for years. I could feel  feelings, I could feel love and I had energy to work and do chores around the house.  Then, about 6 months ago, it just stopped working. I can't feel any feelings anymore at all, and all my depression symptoms are back. I have been weaning myself off of the drug with a pill splitter, down to 15 mg per day from 120 mg.  My doctor is afraid I'm going to have a manic episode when I wean off it, but anything would be better than this!!",5,16
Latuda,"At the start after titrating up to 80mg of Latuda, everything was fine. Then the restless leg issue started and I started having panic attacks from the inability to stay still. I ended up admitting myself to the hospital. After taking Latuda at night my symptoms would start and only get slightly better with benzodiazepines and Requip for restless leg syndrome. I stopped taking the medication and now I feel like I can control my own body again. Never touching this medication again.",2,24
Latuda,This medication Laltuda made me want to jump out of my skin with jitteryness and restlessness. Ive never felt anything like it in my life. It was extremely uncomfortable even on only 40 mg. The good things about the medication is that I had energy and I can sleep well at night. Also my appetite wasnt as high as when I took other medications. The feelings it gave me definitely outweighed the good.,5,17
Latuda,"Im not so sure if Im bi polar I seem to get different diagnoses from different drs I have been taking Latuda for about 5 days now.  It helps with the depression a little bit. It takes it from the dark place and moves it up a bit. It does nothing for anxiety. It makes my head feel like its in a vice and when the vice is tightened I get a bout of confusion and not sure where Im at. Ive been on antidepressants before and even  they stop working, Ive had better luck on them. Im going to stop Latuda and maybe try prestiqu.. good luck all",3,11
Latuda,Horrible experience with Latuda. Severe Akathisia and horrible restlessness felt like I wanted to jump out of my body. Do not recommend.,1,13
Latuda,"I don't understand anyone starting any higher than 20mgs.  I started at 10mgs.  I couldn't sleep and was so restless I coudn't imagine starting any higher.  Took 25mg Seroquel to sleep and only slept about 3 hours, but it's lifts my depression in 1 day.     .",5,12
Latuda,"So, I took Latuda for 3 years from 2013-2015 and it pulled me out of severe depression of 3years.  Started an extremely stressful job with 1.5 hr commute one way!  Terrific drug for Bipolar  depression!  But became non-effective.   Now 2019 and trying it again.  Been on it for 2 weeks.  Started at 20mg and doing dosing pack samples titrations up.  After 2 weeks I felt the huge difference.  Like a light switch clicked on!  First two weeks was exhausted and slept for 13 hrs a night!  After 2 weeks it went away!  Work 12 hr. Days and actually enough energy to run errands after work!  Phenomenal!!!  I even had energy to water my front yard last night!  Oh my gosh!!!! Titrated up to 40 now for 2 days!  Note, it can become non-effective just like any drug.  Trick is to hang in there.  This med can take up to one month to become effective the first time taking it!!!  Stay on it!  Do have aches in bones due to it but sleeping well and feel human!!!  Thanks Latuda!",10,29
Latuda,"I have bipolar II and started taking this for depression, the first two weeks I started on 20mg and I immediately noticed some sadness, unusual crying, feel lethargic and unmotivated. After upping my medication to 40mg in the third week, I am 100% certain this medicine is NOT for me. I feel more depressed and abnormal thoughts. I definitely don't feel like myself :(",1,18
Latuda,"Absolute life changer. Was on 600mg of seroquel, 200mg of lamitrogine, and valdoxan. Since cutting down the seroquel to 100mg  immediate release and  adding in 40mg of Latuda, I'm honestly a new person. No anxiety. Irritability of seroquel has gone. Anger problems diminished. Honestly the happiest and most stable I've ever been in my life. Costs a lot (Australia), but worth every cent. 80mg of Latuda made me too edgy. Been on it for a year and wouldn't change a thing.",10,14
Latuda,"Been on a variety of different med cocktails on and off until steadily starting topamax around 2008 for Bipolar Disorder I, mixed episodes, Generalized Anxiety, and ADHD. Just for my bipolar and mixed episodes I am currently only taking Topamax 800mg and now Latuda, which I started in February at 20mg. I noticed a huge positive benefit within 2 weeks. At my third month my doc and I increased my dose to 40mg. I was only on that dose for maybe 6 weeks, and was still feeling some depression leaking through, so we recently upped my dose to 60mg. I have noticed myself shaking my foot some and feeling anxious a little, but, I also could relate that to my annoying family members who are in town. Dont forget to keep in mind us Bipolar People are highly triggered by our surrounding environment, so dont be too quick to blame your meds, especially if youve already been taking them for several months and your doctor was smart enough to start you low and work you up in dosing.",9,12
Latuda,"I hate this drug Latuda! I have been on it for four weeks. At first it helped a lot, I felt like it was working. Two weeks in and I started sweating profusely, am constantly overheated. Im restless. My anxiety is at a 5 24/7. I cant relax, cant sleep. Ive gained 7 pounds, even though I have no appetite and my stomach is in pain and I am bloated. I feel like Im going to jump out of my skin. I think it is also effecting my hormones as well. Going to the doctor today to get off of this stuff. I was doing much better on resperidone.",1,20
Latuda,"After day 9, I had had enough of my life.  I am a 38 year old woman with a reasonably good life, a wonderful son, NO REASON to leave this life.  I have been WAY more depressed before without  having negative ideations.  I am still in shock!  Please consider other options!",1,15
Latuda,"Latuda is the only med Im on now and it makes me feel so sick and exhausted, trying to wait out the side affects for my DR but its too much to handle",3,10
Latuda,When I first started Latuda I noticed my mood got worse within the first 2 weeks. By week 3 my mood improved immensely. I have been on Latuda for about 5 weeks now. It has been the only medication that has helped me so far. The only downfall is that it is very expensive.,9,13
Latuda,"I love Latuda for my bipolar. I didn't notice how much it helped until I stopped taking it for a bit. I got so much angier and more depressed. Not like regular depression, but that dark depression.  It helps so much. I took it while I was pregnant and the only issue I had was I chose not to breastfeed because of it. I did not want it to effect her. During pregnancy I didn't notice anything. My daughter was born at 37 weeks to preeclampsia  and her bili count was low. She is now 6 months old and beautiful. She does have colic and acid reflux. I do not know if that is due to the medication or just simply how she is.",9,10
Latuda,Latuda worked for my bipolar disorder for some time. After increasing it to 60 mg it all went downhill. Latuda made me pace back and forth all day long. Three months of this and I suspected Latuda. My doctor would not prescribe anything to counteract this. Benzodiazepines would have helped. I reduced the medication and I am choosing to quit,6,12
Latuda,"I've been taking just a starter dose of Latuda for the last few months, but I have felt quite a positive difference in this time. It is not a main medication of mine. I take three other bipolar medications, too. I'm not sure if Latuda will ever replace any of my medications, but if it makes my life better at a small dose, I'm happy. I also like that it has allowed me to have my other antipsychotic lowered. The lower that antipsychotic dose goes, the fewer side effects I have.",8,12
Latuda,"This med is a bit of a wild ride for me being diagnosed with bipolar depression  I started off with 60 mg for a couple months and I didnt think it was doing much I was still  hallucinating and hearing voices. I went up 80 mg and it was alright but Im trying to get off this med Im starting to have side affects not able to sit still, serious anxiety and I cant seem to stop shaking my leg.  Im going to talk to my doctor to get on 40 mg I cant take this side affects its seriously killing me.  It make work it May not its different for others but it help me get back to normal living. No longer hearing voices or hallucinations are gone thats a plus",9,8
Latuda,I was on Latuda for a limited time due to horrific side effects.  I had no control of my legs and was nearly killed.  I ended up in the hospital under the Neurology service for 5 days.  I stopped Latuda and that helped a lot.  Its a dangerous drug.,1,25
Latuda,I have been on 60mg for 5 years now and it is great for my schizoaffective and bipolar disorders. I just take celexa additionally for anxiety. It took a while to zero in on the right dosage for me. I had previously been on many antipsychotics. Very expensive until it goes generic,10,9
Latuda,Ive been on this medication for about seven months now and it has kept me stable. The only issue that I have is that my co-pay is too much so I  will need to be transitioned over to a different medication.  Right now I am receiving samples of 60 mg. Currently I am on four different meds to manage my bipolar.  My pharmacologist wants me on a mono therapy but that just simply isnt going to work.,10,4
Latuda,It makes me feel horrible and have panic attacks. Also I gained a lot of weight on Latuda. I absolutely hate Latuda!,2,16
Latuda,"This medication  latuda has done wonders for my bipolar disorder. It took about a month before I noticed the effects, but I have been stable for over two years now. The only issue I have is a bit of akathisia.",9,17
Latuda,"This stuff is HORRIBLE! BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE I took Latuda for 5 weeks. I was in the hospital for bipolar disorder when I was put on this trash. Started at 40mg was bumped up to 80mg. I can not explain how horrible and awkward I felt. This terrible med needs to be taken off to the public. I ended up in such a dark, dark place on this. If you feel different PLEASE DON'T DO WHAT I DID AND WAIT TO CALL YOUR DOCTOR!! CALL ASAP. I would say more, but this is a public post. I have NEVER felt so horrible in my life. I'm 33 and been on psych meds for schizoaffective disorder since I was 14.",1,25
Latuda,I think comments on this site are rubbish. Notice how every comment is written. Perfectly worded and grammatically correct with commas in the right place. Oh did I forget to mention how many comments begin and end with quotes  .,7,16
Latuda,Hate hate hate hate this medication. I was on 20 mg and I felt ok. Made me very irritable so upped to 40 mg. Biggest mistake. I feel so sick. Severely depressed. I wasn't depressed. I'm in such pain. I cry a lot. I want to feel happy. It's a absolute nightmare for me. I lowered to 30 mg yesterday and I feel even sicker.  I really don't know what to do. I'm so sad and I don't want anyone to go thru this.  Every medication works different for everyone. I'm not saying this medication won't work for you. It might do wonders. This is just my bad experience  Good luck,1,18
Latuda,"I've tried so many different medications, and maybe it's just me, but Latuda is a miracle drug.  It's been 6 months and no side effects whatsoever, but my hallucinations  (auditory and visual) have stopped and I feel less depression.  There's no anxiety and no weight gain (both are a big deal for me).  I'm on 60mg a day and that seems to take care of my issues.  If you're having side effects, check out what other meds you are taking; maybe there's a contraindication present.  Also, start out at 20 and work your way up slowly.  I am also on Prozac (yeah...I know...) but that's only because I have kids and I need to extra energy boost to get through the day (because toddlers).  Don't give up on this medication, it's better than so many others.",10,25
Latuda,"Ive been on Latuda for 5 years. It saved my life after strugging not to commit suicide every single day for over 7 years. I had to put out a great deal of effort not to blow my brains out. I had it all planned and thought about it constantly. Now, though I will tremble forever (I had whatever its called, the trembling), but I would gladly have this than the constant thoughts of suicide. When my doctor, during those years, would ask me if I felt suicidal I would always say no because Ive been in a psychiatric hospital before and dont ever want to go back. One day, I told him the truth. I was so depressed that I figured a hospital was better than my two little girls having to deal with my death. I cant tell you what its done for my life and that of my girls and husbands lives as well. I will be forever grateful for this drug.",9,24
Latuda,I was put on Latuda 20 mg and slowly went up to 60 mg. Let me start off by saying that I cannot stress enough how much this medication has changed my life! I have never felt so normal. I can see and think clearly. I did experience akathisia but was put on propranolol for a week and it went away. I feel like life is worth living now! Latuda has saved my life!,10,30
Latuda,"I have only been on Latuda a short period of time, unfortunately I have to taper to off of it. It makes me feel very lightheaded and dizzy. I have difficulty sleeping and have developed bad insomnia. Like others mentioned in their reviews I feel flat not happy or sad. The reason I am weaning off of it is because I almost went to the ER last evening. My anxiety was through the roof, feels like you just want to jump out of your skin. Remember everyone is different and trying new medications is very complex. Always talk to your Doctor before taking or stopping a medicine. Good Luck to all who are suffering.",1,18
Latuda,"I was diagnosed 15 years ago for bipolar I disorder. I was put on a very high dose of lamotrigine (450 mg) and lithium (1500-1800 mg). My memory was decimated and my thinking was dulled and I had other cognitive issues including ability to concentrate and pay attention. After 14 years on this regime, I sought another doctor's opinion. He cross-tapered Latuda (dosing up to 60 mg), and lowered the lithium from 1800 mg to zero! We did this over 6 months, very gradually. I am eternally grateful to my doctor. My mind became free again and most of my cognitive problems either diminished or went away entirely. What a great, life-changing decision. I wish you well on your path to healing. Never give up!!",10,33
Latuda,Been for on Latuda over 2 months for bipolar mania and depression at a dose of 20mg taken at night help ensure sleep and really cleared up thoughts. No issues.,9,16
Latuda,"Only been on Latuda a couple of weeks and I'm noticing improvements in my depression that are bizarre, in a good way. Didn't do much at a dose 20mg but now at 40mg dose it really works - I feel LIKE THE KING OF THE WORLD. I can't explain it. I just want to jump for joy. Anyway, male, 6'5, 220 lbs. No akathesia yet like everyone talks about but if it happens I will just lower the dose. Excited about this med because the improvements in my extreme depression are miraculous. Medicaid covers it too--it is pretty expensive if you don't have good insurance.",10,20
Latuda,"Started taking Latuda about 1 year ago for bipolar  and never did its job as I never saw any positive effects. I did however have issues with the side effects of  it knocking me out, tremors and muscle stiffness. The fact that it makes me want to sleep all day makes me very depressed. I also started having more than usual really dark thoughts. Started seeing a new doc and he is taking me off it but the  withdrawals from Latuda are horrible.",1,17
Latuda,"For the first two weeks I felt an improvement of mood (I have bipolar). I am on Lamictal, Seroquel and Ativan for the occasional anxiety. I started out on 20 mgs then after two weeks went to 40 mg. Right at the three week mark thats when I started to have extreme panic attacks, restlessness, and I felt out of my mind. I already suffer from hypomania, disassociation, and anxiety, and this medication exponentially increased it. I felt out of my mind and decided to quit cold turkey, which is kind of disheartening because I was desperate for a pill that would work for my severe depression and hypomania. Everything was intensified to the point. Voices in my head, panic attacks, anxiety over everything, and a complete loss of time and space. I wouldnt recommend this drug to anyone with preexisting anxiety disorders.",0,21
Latuda,"I started taking Latuda about 8 months ago when I got diagnosed Bipolar in the hospital after a manic episode. Initially I felt very tired, numb, and had social anxiety. It has balanced me out and I haven't felt more stable in my life. No crazy anger outbursts, no suicidal ideations, or impulsivity. The only downsides are the side effects. I have pretty bad social anxiety and in the beginning I was so exhausted but now that has gone away, clenching of the jaw/teeth, shaky hands/head, I overheat. But the longer I take it the more the side effects lessen. Over all- I would take the side effects over the horrible mental illness.",8,14
Latuda,"I replaced my Seroquel with Latuda because the former wasn't working well any longer and I gained a lot of weight. I only lost a few pounds after the switch to 80mg of Latuda. So, my Doctor and I worked on a trial and error program with a combination of drugs. Here's what's working for me as of now: 20mg of Latuda (makes me drowsy and that's about it...so I take it at night), 400mg of Lamotrigine (can't think of any side-effects), and 0.5mg of Xanax every night. I've always had trouble sleeping so the combo of Latuda and Xanax takes care of that. The Xanax also helps with the anxiety I've always had, the Lamotrigine keeps the mania and some of the depression away, and the Latuda seems to take the rest of the depression away. I've been stable with this combination and lost another 11 lbs. The biggest downside-besides cost- is the drowsiness I have during the day. A 20 min nap helps with that.",7,14
Latuda,"Because of latuda I now have side effects of constant restlessness, I'm always sleepy, I have uncontrollable facial movements, teeth grinding, blinking excessively at times, very dizzy a lot of the time and lightheaded, lots of nausea vomiting, major loss of appetite, I lost 40 lbs, inability to keep still most of the time, agitation, blurred vision, no sex drive, confused, dry skin, stiff neck I can't turn all the way, twitching uncontrollably of my eyes mouth tongue face arms legs lips, my back is always sore, my anxiety attacks are worse, I'm hyperactive, I feel manic all the time, always feel nervous, I have tightening of my jaw and snapping and I even chipped a tooth, constant headaches back lower skull always tense, trouble collecting my words, weird jerking movements from my fingers toes arms legs face lips mouth tongue and eyes, unsure of what to do next, restless confused looking for something to do constantly, I always feel weak, sweating of my hands and feet. And it won't go away!!",1,19
Latuda,"Suffered from bi polar depression (what they say) my whole life, it gets worse with different experiences, mimicks things like ADHD, anxiety, etc (so they say). Started Latuda 5 days ago. First day felt great, day 2 felt great, day 3 I slept 1.5 hours after a 10 hour day then did another 10 hours.  The restlessness was unbearable, tried different beds, couch, different positions, baths, I had this incredibly strong energy that was dying to explode in every part of my body. It made me cry, punch and scream in pillows. The next day I felt so tired and weak. I switched taking my 40mg from at night to in the morning, we will see how this works.",6,10
Latuda,"Been on 120 mg Latuda now for about a year.  I really felt a difference right away, no more extreme lows with anger, no more mania with urges to do crazy things or act out.  Feel very stable, but somewhat numb at times.  It does kill any libido I had.  No changes in weight.  Restless legs though if I take it to early before bed, so I take as close to bedtime as possible to sleep through it.  Overall great drug, best Ive been on in the last 6 years.  I recommend it myself.",9,13
Latuda,The quiz are you bipolar? isn't useful at all It's simply addresses the manic side. Bipolar includes both manic and depressive and some of us live in the depressive side. Until the manufacture acknowledges BOTH sides of bipolar I would stay away from this medication,2,13
Latuda,"Was prescribed Latuda and told that 20 mg would be wasting both my and the doctors time. Started at 20 mg the first week and upped to 40 mg. Felt good, but thought I could feel better, so I asked to up the dosage to 80 mg. Huge mistake! The restlessness, pacing, severe insomnia, heart palpations, etc. I had slept 10 hours in a two week period and felt like I was crawling out of my skin while thinking really dark thought. I immediately started tapering my dose and saw the doctor on day three of withdrawal. She prescribed benztropine once a day and hydroxyzine three times day as needed. I'm still feeling not right and tapering again to 20 mgs. I cannot wait to get this out of my system.",1,9
Latuda,"WOW.  Latuda was an amazing drug for me. It made me feel completely normal. It was one of the most relieving feeling ever, it lifted me right out of my dark depression that I was in for months. The crying spells, self harm, anger, and my suicidal ideation is gone, now I actually want to live! It's a strange but welcome feeling. It is one of the very few antipsychotics that I don't feel chemically lobotimized on. Only problem is about 3 months in I started developing akathisia and it was interfering with my sleep, so I had to be taken off of it. We are trying another med with less risk but I like Latuda so much I think I might go back on it along with Cogentin to help the akathisia.",8,15
Latuda,"I took Latuda 40mg for 10 months and I felt it was effective for my mood swings, However, I began having intense anxiety. Im talking paranoid, terrifying, nonstop anxiety. I had akathesia, and outrageous muscle twitches. I couldnt eat, I lost 17 pounds in 6 weeks. I didnt need to lose, btw. I finally tapered off, which was extremely difficult.  It has been 6 months since Ive stopped taking it and I am still having some side effects! Please do your research before taking this medication! Its absolutely not worth losing your mind.  The long term side effects are still unknown. Im still trying to heal. I couldnt even leave my house! So, just a heads up...if youre going through this, youre not alone! It does get a little better once you get away from it.",1,16
Latuda,"I was on Latuda for about 2 months for my bipolar the first month was going great.  Then as soon as my Doctor upped my dose I felt like I was loosing my mind. It wasn't even that high -  40 mg.  I  ended up at the ER so many nights with  panic attacks, got hospitalized for 2 days for suicidal thoughts and severe anxiety. Literally 2 days after getting of the meds I stated to feel better. I would never wish my experience on anyone.",2,26
Latuda,"I'm 40, and I have been going thru this all my life, I'm having GAD, Depression and Panic Attacks, I tried all out there, my first med was Lorazepam, and then all kind of SSRI, SNRI, I was stable for many years with SSIRs and then all started to grow in diff way, I became Bipolar Depression with Panic Attacks, started all sort of mood stabilizers in combination with SSRI, but it didn't work well, now on antipsychotic meds for depression and  Pexeva 10 for OCD, Latuda 40 (less then 3 weeks now), also I'm taking mood stabilizer Trileptal 600 combination with Chlorpromazine 10, this mix helps me, and I'm more motivated and happy this days, I never put comments but I think to share it, and might help people, I love read comments myself thou, thank you and may all of you feel better soon!!!.",10,22
Latuda,I was put on this medication after I had a psychotic manic episode on lithium. I take 80mg per day. Since I have been on this medication my mania is gone and I can live a  normal life. I really like Latuda and highly recommend it to anyone else. It has made my life much better and I finally live mania free. Of course there are side effects but dealing with the illness was much worse.,10,14
Latuda,"This may not be the best option for people with a psychotic diagnosis. I have bipolar 1, mixed, with psychotic features. (Along with OCD, ADHD, and PTSD). This medication made my psychotic symptoms so much worse. The hallucinations and delusions I experienced were out of control within days of taking this med.",1,13
Latuda,"I started on Latuda 4-5 months ago for Bipolar Depression. I feel so much happier now. I used to get up, go to work, and then go to bed. I would stay in bed on my days off. After Latuda, I was able to get up and clean my house; I started going out with my friends again. It has been the only light at the end of the tunnel since 2012. The downsides include horrible, daily, all-day nausea. It is not controlled by Zofran. In the beginning, I would throw up unexpectedly--that has stopped.  I do clench my jaw terribly and have very slight weird tongue movements. The tongue movements are pretty much controlled by taking benadryl at night with the Latuda. Initially, I took Latuda in the morning but it made me very, very tired to the point I was missing work.  All in all, for me, the good outweighs the bad with this drug.",8,26
Latuda,"Latuda was one of the first drugs I was prescribed once I was diagnosed with Bipolar II.  I took it along with Lamictal. I HATED the Latuda.  I gave it six weeks before I had enough and I got my doctor to prescribe me something else. The Latuda gave me horrible akathisia. If you know what restless leg syndrome is like, just imagine it for your entire body AND your brain, all-day every day. I was miserable. I couldn't be out socially because it made me feel trapped and out of control to the point where I felt paralyzed by it all. I couldn't be at home by myself because it was all I could focus on. I began to just cry out of frustration.",0,22
Latuda,"Latuda has been a game-changer for me.  Yeah, I'm still a bit nuts but it's manageable.  I can live life and find some joy in it.  I'm getting so much accomplished, I'm taking care of myself.  I'm making big moves in my life and finally doing the things I always wanted to do.  This isn't just mania, this has been a long-term change.   It makes me super hungry and I crave food all the time, but not as much as some of the other antipsychotics.  I'm actually getting bariatric surgery just so I can hopefully finally beat antipsychotic weight gain. However, the 40mg dose I take initially made me incredibly sick when I took it.  I had to split the dose in half and take it twice a day, but the sick feeling is completely gone.",8,17
Latuda,"I was recently put on Latuda whilst an inpatient at a clinic to compliment my Lamotrigine/Seroquel mix, as apparently it has good evidence they work well together.  I lasted just 1 week.   I know Latuda can work wonders for some people.  So don't let me turn you off trying it.  Although for me it was terrible.  No physical side-effects, only terrible emotional effects.  I had extreme anxiety, restlessness, irritability and intense anger... also increased suicide ideology.  I was completely out of character whilst on it and even felt loopy;  It took a week to realise it was the Latuda causing it.  As soon as I went off it, within 2 days of stopping, the emotional side-effects had subsided and I am back to normality with my Lamotrigine/Seroquel combo.",1,15
Latuda,"I thought Latuda was ok until my legs started moving uncontrollably. The facial movements started a couple of months later. I've been off of it for a few weeks now and all of the movements have gotten worse. I rock when I'm sitting or standing because I can't stop moving.  It's embarrassing, interferes with my sleep and I don't know if it'll ever go away.",1,18
Latuda,"Ive been on this meds since 2014 for my bipolar I disorder! I love it, it has worked wonders for me, and hasnt given me any negative symptoms. I did gain weight when I first started taking it, but now my weight has stabilized out, and Im back to where I should be! I actually didnt know weight gain was a side effect until today. I love it, and take it at every night. It does make me hungry at night, but I ignore that urge. So beware of that. But for me, I would suggest taking it at night cause it makes me very tired. It keeps me stable and makes me not float off into the clouds. I know everyone responds differently to meds, but I would definitely give this one a shot! Im on 80 mg, and am going to up my dose cause I do have spurts of hypomania every now and then. But thats cause Ive been on 80 mg for the past three years. In need of a med adjustment.",10,19
Latuda,"I always had problems tolerating latuda. When I started on 20mg it used to put me right to sleep, then when I was increased to 40mg I had the worst nausea, they had to split my dose so I could tolerate it. It seemed to work so I toughed it out. I got all the way up to 80mg and even tried 100mg but it made me vomit every time I took it. Im currently tapering off of it because the nausea is unbearable now. The other thing I hate about it is the caloric requirement. It makes me so nauseous I dont have an appetite and then have to force myself to eat 350 cals. Wasnt worth it, glad to be getting off of it.",3,11
Latuda,"I have been diagnosed w/Major Depression w/ Mixed Features. anniversary reaction to 4 Major events /guess I finally had a breakdown ...Ive always kept it   together as I am med phobic. I went into massive depression/ anxiety. My pdoc. been very patient w/me &amp; really tried educate me on Latuda.  It took 3 months for me to finally take medi with much conversation &amp; her explanating benefits of   sleep .  Im 10mgs of Lexapro/ 20mgs Latuda w Food @ night @ I take 1mg of Xanax as needed.. since taking Latuda I dont need use any Benzo.  Im calm through the day. I dont feel depressed like I was, it was bad.  I feel like Im getting my life back in order again. Its only been about 2,3 weeks. My Doc was very good about taking time to explain its not just for one condition &amp; there are off label uses. If your doc suggests this MED, give it a shot,i ts worth it, especially for MDD &amp; Anxiety. Good luck out there",10,21
Latuda,"I've been taking Latuda for 7 months now and its been really smooth. I take it for my Bi-polar, Severe Anxiety and Manic Depression. I usually have insomnia too, but I noticed I'm able to sleep better with this. And on a good note I haven't experienced any side effects from it. I'm able to socialize with others more and get things done in my daily life...which is really good.",10,22
Latuda,I started the medication about 3 weeks ago and I just got increased to 40 mg and at first I was at 20mg.   I constantly feel like I want to cry and I'm always so angry at every one for no reason.  It's the worst feeling and DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT.  But everyone had their own opinions and it definitely works different on everyone,1,15
Latuda,"Latuda has worked great for me. It is the only thing I've tried that has worked for my depression consistently. I do experience the RLS every now and again but I just make sure I take it when I'm really sleepy and sleep through it. I'm on 40 mg and I like that I'm on such a low dose with the results I'm getting. It helps to stabilize my moods and I don't go from one extreme to the other all the time. It might happen maybe 2x a month if that. I didn't experience any nausea and it doesn't make me drowsy but this is coming from a person that Ambien as no effect on.  I've noticed its helped with my GAD as well. Between the Lyrica and the Latuda, my anxiety is very well in check. I do have mild bipolar and borderline and I'm sure that has something to do with how well this medication helps me, but it works. At least for me. I know everyones chemistry is different. Thankfully I have great insurance and it pays for all of it because it can be very pricey.",9,15
Latuda,HORRIBLE!!! this drug made my body shake and my muscles tighten up to the point where my back is all knots. It has caused my breasts to swell up very badly. I stopped taking it about a month ago and I still cannot stop shaking. In the beginning I thought it was just my body adjusting to the drug but then the symptoms never went away. So I decided to get off it and the shaking continues. I did some research and this drug has caused permanent damage to people and there are some serious lawsuits against it in the works. I'm so shocked. I should've done my research before taking latuda - I feel so stupid. This is a dangerous drug and there is no telling if youll be one of the lucky ones or if youll get hit bad by it like most of us.,1,21
Latuda,"So far so good. I have been on this drug now for about three weeks. No adverse effects. Taking for Bipolar II. I am coming off of Clonazepam and started Latuda. Seems to be helping so far...I am a big believer in the Placebo effect. But I haven't had the nausea like some other people on here and so far not overly sleepy but not getting more anxiety with taking. Less, in fact. I was concerned about taking it originally because I had a bad effect from Lamictal. This one seems to be working well so far though.",8,9
Latuda,"The first 2 weeks or so on 60mg I had terrible akathesia, I'd be on all fours pounding the ground trying not to scream because it was so bad. It got upped to 80mg and I started taking it as the last thing before going to bed, which helped. I'm almost 2 months in and am tapering off because its caused anxiety, its messed up my gait and I don't walk normally now, it makes me talk slow and slurred, I get random muscle jerks in my legs somewhat frequently, and it makes me feel absolutely apathetic about everything. I feel like my emotions are completely flat, I'm not sad but also not happy, just flat.",5,18
Latuda,"I took Latuda for 6 months and at first it seemed to help my bipolar symptoms but then I took a major turn two months later. I ended up back in jail because I went into full manic chaos. Going off on people threatening them, suicidal etc. I actually got worse than what I was when I first started. Never Again",1,9
Latuda,"Latuda calms me down. My psychiatrist upped my dosage from 10 to 20mg when I experienced a hypomanic episode, and then I was able to calm down and function. For me, it reduces anxiety, but Ive noticed I become very forgetful. I also gained a lot of weight on it. I feel like its choosing the lesser of two evils, and Id much rather mentally function with a few negative side effects. Its made a world of difference in my ability to do every day tasks.",10,18
Latuda,Was put on Latuda for a few months it was the worst thing I ever experienced I wasn't able to drive because I was constantly dizzy have been off of the medication for about 2 years or so and I still have uncontrollable muscle movements to the point people honestly think I am on street drugs. Along with that I have had extremely bad stomach issues and  nobody can figure out why or how to control the stomach problems. I have spent time in the hospital being put though so many testings only to be right back to square 1 still no explanation and don't have a clue who to even go to for legal advice nor take legal action. Latuda has not only caused physical permanent issues but also suffering from the remarks made to and about me,1,19
Latuda,"I took Latuda for 2.5 years (depression/anxiety). After a year, I developed akathisia (feeling of inner restlessness and a compelling need to move). My symptoms: involuntary leg movement and finger twiddling, waves of restlessness. Sometimes the restlessness was so bad I had to scream into a pillow, and I self-injured several times. The screaming helped, the self-injury didn't. Because I was already taking Inderal, my psychiatrist tried adding L-DOPA. It didn't help. Finally I weaned off the Latuda. The restlessness and leg movements went away within 2 months. Three years later I still can't break the finger-twiddling habit. Trying to stop brings triggers restlessness. I also have an internal monologue of thoughts that started when I stopped Latuda. Unchecked, it causes me to gesture and make facial expressions. I cope my meditating daily and listening to a lot of audiobooks. I didn't know what akathisia was when it started happening to me, so I didn't know who to ask for help. I wish I had complained harder and sooner to my psychiatrist.",2,17
Latuda,"After just a week or two starting this medicine my body shut down and was hospitalized. During the time of admitting into the emergency room I couldn't speak and had no contact information on me. They listed me as John doe and I began recovery. It's now on a list of allergic reactions for me. At the time  I was given the diagnose of bipolar disorder and that lithium is the oldest, safest, and fix for bipolar disorder. Lithium works the best so why label latuda for it, when side affects or so high. Just concerned for other young men and women.",1,18
Latuda,I had been on Abilify for about five years along with my other psych meds for Bipolar II and was doing well. I had to go out on stress leave from my job and developed low grade depression. I had maxed out on my two antidepressants and Abilify so my doctor had me try Latuda. For the first week it seemed to lift my mood but in the middle of the second week I began experiencing what I thought were stomach flu symptoms. Those symptoms worsened until I ended up in the E.R. for GERD (gastroesophogeal reflux disease). Unfortunately I had to stop that and am now trying a different antipsychotic (Rexulti).,0,11
Latuda,"After 2 weeks Latuda magically pulled me out of SEVERE bipolar depression. The depression significantly impaired my cognition but Latuda made my foggy, slow brain go back to normal! I was able to return to nursing school and get A's! Before Latuda I could barely survive in a low skill manual labor job. Only downfall is the anxious sensation that I get a couple hours after I take the medication. Fortunately, I take it at night and I'm able to sleep through those uneasy feelings.",10,20
Latuda,Gained 30 lbs and felt drained all day. Been much better since I got off of it.,1,8
Latuda,"It's been great. I felt pure relief within days. Within weeks, I stopped feeling depressed, stopped having frequent negative thoughts and I've regained my energy. I am able to go to work and school without feeling exhausted.  I was anorexic, I was severely underweight but it's been stabilizing since being on this drug. My appetite that left me because of the depression is now back. I am very satisfied  (For those complaining about their increased weight on this drug; exercise more, eat less.)  This is the best anti depressant I've been on so far",8,14
Latuda,It makes me go off on these rage filled tangents and tantrums  - that scare my family and me. But whenever I tell them the latuda makes me feel this way they ignore what I say and so does the pdoc. I am so depressed I have gained 20 lbs+ from taking it. I don't like this med but nobody listens to me.,4,16
Latuda,"HORRIBLE DRUG! Beware of the side effects. I have had severe tremors, restlessness, abnormal sweating... I feel like i've been living in another world. This has caused so much more anxiety than I had before as I don't even feel human. I can't sleep. My doctor instructed me to stop taking this med immediately! That my side effects are severe. FYI, was taking for Bipolar.  This all happened in 8 days. I can't stand or sit still. Muscle weakness. Please be careful and take caution when beginning this med. Hope others have better luck than I did with this.",1,20
Latuda,"My doctor tried switching me from Zyprexa to Latuda due to concern about weight gain, diabetes and cholesterol. My psychiatrist thought that the side effects from Latuda would not be as bad. For the first three days, it was wonderful, I felt fine. After the second week of taking 20 mg, I had started throwing up violently and had diarrhea at the same time. The vomit was green bile in color. After that, my doctor took me off it,I still continued vomiting for another week. I had to go on a soft diet and still had stomach pain. I underwent an endoscopy, and several small ulcers and erosion was found in my stomach. My gastroenterologist believed that this may have been caused by the Latuda, as I did not have this problem before. To top it off, it's very expensive, even with insurance. I would not recommend.",3,10
Latuda,"In 2016, 120mg worked great. Due to the expense I had to switch. Recently, in 2018, my new insurance covers the drug.  I was warned Latuda had changed and may not work the same. I started on 20mg for 2mo. My energy was back and I felt better. It didn't help my impulse/rage, so the third month I was bumped to 40mg. 3 days later, a hour after taking my 40mg, I had the biggest panic attack in my life! I wasn't able to take care of myself let alone my daughter. My S/O had to leave work early to come home.  I called the Dr but had to leave a message.  I debated going to the ER but I read online to try Benadryl. After 4hrs of panic and not being able to function, the Benadryl calmed me down. When the Dr called back, she told me to go back to 20mgs. Although I wanted to be done with it, I stuck it out for another month waiting for today's appt. The Dr decided to wean me off to start vraylar next week. So bummed it didn't work out this time around. Definitely worth a chance though!",5,9
Latuda,"Latuda has been amazing at controlling my visual hallucinations. My mood is more stable and I feel better. The only dislike I have with this medication is that it completely kills your sex drive. For myself, the pros outweigh the con. Ive definitely improved on this medication.",9,9
Latuda,"I got on Latuda while I was pregnant with my daughter because what I was taking wasn't safe for a baby.  I have to say, at first I thought it was great.  It seemed to level me out and I did well for a while.  Then things started to change drastically for me.  I was noticing my anxiety was through the roof and I was constantly obsessing about things happening that were far from reality.  This went on for a couple of years, until I reevaluated that my life turned upside down months after I started taking this drug.  I had never been so far from reality and not present.  This drug literally took life from me and made me lose myself.  I am currently tapering off the drug and began something else and already feel these horrible effects tapering off.  The paranoia that I felt was almost unbearable at times and it was the worst experience I have ever dealt with.  I can't say that I don't recommend this to others, because we all react differently.  But this medication definitely wasn't for me.",1,14
Latuda,"Hi. I'm 35 and took Latuda for two years. I was only diagnosed two years ago (I refused help for years), so it's the only one I've been on. I had amazing results! My whole life changed after living bipolar for so many years and being untreated. I had no idea it could make such a difference! I am currently 37 weeks pregnant and chose to get off of it at the beginning because it's a newer medicine. They've monitored me and I've done ok. Coming off of it wasn't too bad. They had me wean myself slowly. I did experience mild restless legs when I first got on it, but it passed. I took it at night because it made me sleep. I think everyone reacts to meds differently, but this one is it for me. My family even said it had been years since they had seen me happy and stable like that. Maybe I just got lucky and didn't have any adverse reactions, but I am a believer in this one and plan to get back on it after the baby is born. I hope all of you find what works!",9,19
Latuda,"I know it is supposed to be a weight neutral drug, but that was not the case for me. I couldn't stop eating, even in the middle of the night, and rapidly put on 10 pounds in a month. I also had problems with restless legs and insomnia. It just wasn't the drug for me. I've stopped and switched to another med, and my appetite has already decreased after just a week.",4,4
Latuda,"Great medication, should be noted that all of those who are suffering side effects such as nausea or akathisia are suffering needlessly as there are multiple medications which resolve those effects quickly and are not very taxing on the body.  Zofran 30 minutes before taking medication for nausea cheap and effective just ask your doc for a script, plenty of people who take latuda use zofran in conjunction and do just fine.  For akathisia either cogentin or propranolol will resolve it quickly and effectively with little side effects.  I have used Latuda for over 3 years now and there is no better, highly recommend this med as nothing else has worked even close to as well and most importantly for those complaining about weight gain they must watch what they eat or workout as I have LOST tons of weight since the switch from Geodon to Latuda years ago and have kept it off.",10,25
Latuda,"This drug showed up on a genetic test as okay to take. I was only on a tiny dose (20mg) but it made me feel awesomeI slept really well, I was able to wake up feeling energized and refreshed in the morning, and I felt the need to make sure that my living space wasnt messy and cluttered. Sadly, I started developing akathesia after about three months and I had to stop it. I tried to power through but it was unbearable to sit still, and once I stopped the symptoms went away after a couple of days.",7,9
Latuda,"It did help to stabilize me. However, I gained 20 pounds within 3 weeks. The weight gain wasnt worth it to me.",2,9
Latuda,"I took latuda for 2 weeks and had loss of appetite,  anxiety, crying spells restless, had most quickly non stop racing thoughts  like I was going mad losing my mind. I now am too afraid to try another medication but I know I need  For a better quality of life.",1,9
Latuda,"I have been taking latuda for one month and it me little motivation, I don't have any side effect and I can do work normally 90%  of the time and 10% of the time I am feeling lazy",9,2
Latuda,"Have been taking  Latuda for about a month with two increases, now at 60 mg for past 4 days. While it has been effective at pulling me out of most recent depressive episode, and seems to have decreased my chronic anxiety, I am now irritable and having trouble falling asleep at night. Also experienced 2 days of twitching eyelid. But last night I experienced the worst RLS episode of my life, dont know if it qualifies as akinesia but it was severe and disturbing. Plan to decrease back down to 40 mg.",7,7
Latuda,The worst psych med I've ever taken. Totally debilitating.  It made me want to sleep all the time. I had to leave work to sleep.  I could hardly function.,1,4
Latuda,"I am bipolar 1 with IED (intermittent explosive disorder).  I spent 47 years of my life on different anti depressants and antipsychotics, all to no avail.  Finally after years of suffering, losing my job and having no coverage a state sponsored TN facility put me on Rexulti that gave me severe twitches so they switched me to Latuda.  I wish I had found this drug as a teen/early adult as my life would have been more productive and less interference from my mood swings.  I now have stable moods, increased energy and the depressive and negative thoughts are all but gone.  No issues with side effects beside a few pounds of weight gain but with increased activity its been easier to lose.  I would recommend this drug to anyone suffering from bipolar 1 or similar type disorders.  I went from 20mg to 40mg after a few months and felt a little sleepier but after a week or so it levelled out again.  Least side affects of anything I have ever had to take.",10,16
Latuda,"Latuda has saved my life after only being on it for 2 weeks. It works by stabilizing moods, docs were putting me on anti depressants, none of which worked, then I met my savior doctor, he is a neuropsychologist- knew immediately after our consult, that latuda would work- it has.  I am out of the darkness back into the light of life! Please do not hesitate if your doc wants to try you on it, get free samples, if possible, it begins working fast, no frustrating waiting game to see if it works. I love this drug. I am saved.  A big thanks to my Doctor.",10,23
Latuda,"Was on Seroquel for bipolar I disorder, but was causing too much weight gain &amp; high blood sugar levels so pdoc put me on Latuda 40 mg.  Now my blood sugar levels are through the roof!  Also pdoc says my kidneys aren't functioning well so have to go for more tests.  The fatigue from the Latuda is unbearable &amp; it is very difficult now to get any housework done.  It's as if I don't care about anything any more.  I gave the Latuda three stars as at least it seems to be controlling hypomania which has been my main trouble with the bipolar disorder.  Have tried many different antipsychotics &amp; they all seem to increase blood sugar levels &amp; weight gain - eg, 30 lbs per year!  At first, the Latuda was causing uncontrollable tongue movements (tardive dyskinesia) so pdoc said she'd like to try propranolol (high blood pressure drug).  I said no to that as I didn't want to just mask the TD!",3,4
Latuda,"At first Latuda seemed to stabilise me, but I soon realised it was enhancing my hypomania and making it difficult to get to sleep. This ultimately led me to stop taking it.",5,6
Latuda,"Took it three days,  lowest dose.  Day one mood lifted and curbed appetite by dinnertime.  Day two some mild nausea set in,  made me feel like I wanted to get things done for the first time in a long time- maybe I'd been borderline hypomanic because I felt the urge to completely clean and rearrange our garage.  Also low appetite.  Day three felt like I couldn't stop moving,  no appetite at all,  and wanted to lay in bed because the nausea was horrible- like I'd been spinning all day,  but couldn't help but pace between the house and outdoors.  Really wanted this one to work.  Back to the drawing board.",2,7
Latuda,This drug have me severe akathesia. It made me wreck and it freaked me out so much I wanted to jump out of my skin!,1,4
Latuda,Caused Tardive Dyskinesia in both my mother and myself. I couldn't believe it at first because it worked well for me for many years. Ultimately it cost my mother her life. I expect more will be revealed about this drug in the future.,1,8
Latuda,I'm taking Latuda for bipolar 2. I started on 20 mg and eventually went up to 40 mg. It seems to work well for me. I haven't experienced any hypomania and over time the bouts of depression subsided. In the beginning I experienced a lot of nausea and sleepiness. That went away after several months. I also experience anxiety and hour or two after taking it occasionally so now I take it at bed time. That seemed to solve that problem. Other than the anxiety I really don't experience any other side effects anymore.,8,8
Latuda,Do not take this after taking Geodon,1,5
Latuda,"So far, its the best antipsychotic Ive ever taken, and Ive taken quite a few. Since my diagnosis of mixed bipolar disorder, Ive had issues finding the right drug to manage both psychotic features like hallucinations and the depression that can come with Bipolar disorder. Since this drugs is specifically approved for bipolar depression, my pDoc thought it would be worth a shot. It works great - my mood has improved, I think clearly, I havent heard a voice in over a month. Plus, my paranoia has all but vanished. I take it with Gabapentin 100mg twice a day, lithium 900mg Daily, and propranolol 10mg twice a day. My one gripe is its price, but that goes down to $15 bucks if you have an activated savings card, which most doctors can give you.",10,10
Latuda,"I read a fair bit of negatives about this drug, I even put off taking it. But I did start taking it and Im grateful I did,  as far as I can tell I had no side effects, none that were prominent, and in a short time I felt a positive change - I cant remember how long it took but it was quick, a week or two. But I was on other meds also. Lithium, Ritalin Seroquel (no longer). Id recommend Latuda,  Im so glad I take it. Its a sturdy drug, it helps with moods and over all feeling off - depression. Ive got energy and interest in life things Id almost forgot about.",9,11
Latuda,"I took this medication for about 2 weeks, and it made my anxiety worse! I couldnt stop the anxiety feeling, and the depression. I was taking  ablify before Latuda, so I decided to go back on the ablify, which really does help!",3,5
Latuda,"I took latuda for two months. It helped with the mania and crying spells. Although it made me tired. I felt sluggish all the time. It worsens tardative dyskinesia. I felt restless at times and had severe anxiety. I worried about anything. I'm now on week three since quitting. The withdrawals were awful at first. I'm finally beginning to feel like myself again. I'm having headaches and mild depression, but so glad I quit. I wouldn't recommend this drug. The side effects and withdrawals are awful!!!",3,4
Latuda,"I am on 20mg of latuda, and 1200mg of lithium and 300mg of bupropion, I just started taking the latuda about 2 weeks ago, yesterday is the first time I noticed any real side effects, I was at work when the nausea and vomiting started, shortly after I notice my left leg was stiff and hurt, as the day went on the pain only got worse. As for my bipolar, I am happier then ever, I usually would drink at gatherings but I noticed I don't even want to drink. I hope I can get past the side effects, this is the first time in 10 years I found something that works.",10,5
Latuda,"If I could give Latuda a 0 rating, I definitely would. The akathisia was terrible, to the point that I would cry all night and every night because I couldnt fall asleep. I was restless yet drowsy. I would watch the clock constantly all day every day because one minute would feel like 4 hours to me- Doing ANYTHING was torture, yet NOT doing anything was also torture. Doctor switched me back to Seroquel XR and I am back to my old self, thank goodness",1,9
Latuda,"I was prescribed Latuda for treatment resistant depression. I took it for around 6 months at different doses. It gave me energy. However, I felt a bit jittery at times. I hated having to eat a minimum of 350 calories with it when taking it before going to sleep. Other than giving me energy it did not alleviate any of my other depression symptoms.",5,3
Latuda,Developed outbursts due to autism &amp; puberty. On Latuda for only 7 days and developed jaw tic (not involuntary; more like  restless leg syndrome  of the jaw) Been off for 13 days and still have jaw movements. Permanent? Too soon to tell but not optimistic. I think this one should be contra-indicated for those who have had tics of the head or neck.,1,4
Latuda,"Been on Latuda for less than 4 weeks. The first week I felt my depression and anxiety symptoms lift. After that, I kept wondering why it felt like it was taking me so long to wake up in the morning. I am mentally exhausted, depressed and feel very restless. I started taking it at night but felt I was still feeling foggy and tired all day long. Not for me.",0,8
Latuda,"I have tried every combo for my Bi polar Depression and manic. I have been on Latuda with my evening meal 40mgs and 10mg lexapro in the morning. I also take tegretol xr 400mg at night for an antimanic and this combination works amazing controlling impulse behavior, depression, and I do take buspar 10mgs twice a day to control anxiety levels. I have never felt better and I can enjoy life. The first 3 weeks were really rough but once you hit a month it's like a switch and everything started feeling normal again and I even go out of my way to join in on family/social events. It welcomes you back into life...give it a chance!!! It's worth it...and so are you.",10,11
Latuda,"This medicine will change your life. Wait it out. Theres a certain adjustment period your brain needs. Dont be hyper aware every time you take it, realize thats just anxiety. Make sure you take it with at least 350 cal or it will not work. Sit back, relax, and  don't listen to that voice in the back of your head telling you youre not good enough.",0,17
Latuda,"Took Latuda for about six months. I've had every side effect. I gained 20 pounds, had awful nausea and heartburn. May help some people, but this med did not agree with me.",4,2
Latuda,I cross tappered from risperdal to Latuda back in July and August. Noticed right away that I was more outgoing and motivated even though I wasnt really depressed before. I got bad anxiety from it for about a month but I pushed through it. Stomach pain and upper back/rib discomfort. Went from 20 to 40 to 60. 60 was too much! Around Thanksgiving I had to put in an emergency call to my pdoc to lower back to 40 due to akisthisia. In December I started getting involuntary movements that I reported to my pdoc. He said we can wait and see! I made an appointment with a neurologist for a second opinion. This is by far the best med Ive ever been on for mood but the side effects suck! Im so torn on what to do next.,8,8
Latuda,"This was for my Depression/anxiety.I have tried a few medications and nothing seemed to be working for me. Im on a Effexor, Concerta, low dose of seroquel and latuda just recently. I started at 20 mg but after a couple months my dr increased it to 40mg. With 20mg I was feeling pretty good, no side effects. I then had a bad week and was in the hospital and was then upped to 40mg. I can tell a huge difference in myself with the increase. Genuinely pretty happy but I had to switch my latuda to bedtime because it makes me extremely tired. The first week I was taking it in the morning and I had to leave work one day because I felt so unbelievably tired. I felt I was going to crash my car on the way home... definitely a powerful drug but when taken correctly it can do wonders.",6,6
Latuda,"I was put on this after Lamictal alone wasnt cutting it for my mixed depression and hypomania episodes. Im bipolar type 2. I got up to 60 mg and couldnt handle the side effects: blurry vision, restless legs, dry mouth, irritability.... So Im now back at 40 mg and that seems like the perfect dose for me; all side effects have subsided and I feel more stable.",7,8
Latuda,"Only made it to day twelve. I found myself restless every night. I could not hold still and my whole body tensed up. I would get angry then cry. I had to take a sleeping pill and fall asleep in order for it to stop. Last day it was so bad I could not drive home from work. I was scared, crying, unsure of my surroundings and thought I might need to go to the hospital. The next day I still feel the effects. It should be out of my system but my body aches and uncontrollable movements have not stopped. From someone who has taken many bipolar medications for 20 years this is the worst. Might have the least known side effects but stay away from it.",1,11
Latuda,"20mg &amp; only made it 3 days.  Day 1- cloud lifted. Appetite subsided.  Day 2- couldn't sit still &amp; kind of queasy, even with extra food. Appetite was practically gone (which, as a binge eater, was an amazing feeling). Day 3- compulsory restlessness; I literally had to be moving. The nausea, even with taking a meal,  was too much to bear on day 3,  which put me into a kind of medicated funk, so there was no day 4... My Pdoc said nausea gets worse,  so why bother with trying day four.  Had been on Seroquel XR in past and dropped it because I was getting heart flutters where I had to catch my breath, and involuntary muscle movements. For 3 years it had worked wonderfully and I hate that I had to drop it.",4,4
Latuda,"I was suicidal constantly since age 15 and went through every medication possible. SSRIs made it worse, mood stabilizers did nothing, and the antipsychotics worked like magic. I gained a ton of weight and developed metabolic syndrome on every other antipsychotic but this one and have lost all the weight I gained from this journey to the right medicine. Of course I get nauseous sometimes but I think for most of us who make it to a drug like Latuda, thats nothing compared to the benefit.",10,8
Latuda,Horrible. Made me nauseous headache dizzy off balance extreme fatigue irritable crying depressed shaking anxious,1,6
Latuda,"No problems except for nervousness, but could be Pristiq med as well. No sex drive but optimistic things will clear up soon.",9,1
Latuda,"I was prescribed this for depression-off label, added 20mg to my Paroxetine. It seemed to help greatly with the depression, but I had to quit after 7 weeks due to Akathisia and extreme dry mouth. Dry mouth was so bad, I begun to get sores on the inside of my lips. Im nervous about not taking it, because it helped a lot. My Doctor upped my Paroxetine when I quit the Latuda - I've got my fingers crossed!",5,4
Latuda,"My husband was prescribed everything for bipolar disorder, and nothing worked; until Latuda. Sadly, not long after he began taking it he started having symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. We are desperately seeking an alternative. Im not aware of any other medication like Latuda that wont cause the same side effects. As far as the bipolar, it helped tremendously. He was healthier mentally than Ive ever seen him. I hope another similar medication is or will be on the market.",5,2
Latuda,"I have been taking 120 mg of Latuda nightly for two months. For years I have been struggling with bi polar depression and schizophrenia. I haven't experienced any mania or depression since beginning this medication. I have been level, happy, genuinely happy even, productive, social,  and calm. I haven't had any auditory or visual occurrences in weeks either. The downsides for me are lack of sex drive and it's become difficult to acheive orgasm. Otherwise it's a great medication. I highly recommend it.",9,4
Latuda,Latuda basically saved my life. I was suicidal and swung between severe depression and wild mania. I've been on 80 mgs for about 3 months now and the only side effects I've had were sleepiness ( which is good because I had raging insomnia) and some anxiety. Dr gave me a script for low does Xanax and Ive never felt better!,10,4
Latuda,I have been 20 years trying different medications and combinations of them. As with any medicine review what works well for someone may have the opposite effect for another. Latuda has literally given me my life back with such debilitating depression I was starting to give up hope! I knew within one week of starting Latuda that I had found the right medication for me.,10,7
Latuda,I have been on Latuda for a short period of time and I am curious if anyone has become super emotional on Latuda?  I am bipolar and have been taking high doses of both Seroquel and Lamictal.  My doctor didn't want to go any higher with either of the two and put me on a low dose of Latuda (20 mg.).  I am so emotional.  Way  more than I normally am.  I want to know if anyone else has had this issue and whether it tapered out?  Thank you.,0,7
Latuda,"Love it , finally felt normal or what I think it means , only problem I have is the restless legs its much worse now that its been increased to 80mg , but I was fine on 60mg , my solution is to sponge my legs with cool water as it happens at night , helps a bit . Otherwise its the magic bullet for me.",8,7
Latuda,"The first few days were fine and my mood was stable, then I started getting really bad restless leg syndrome. Someone else on here said feeling mentally exhausted and restless at the same time and I also experienced that. It was a very strange, uncomfortable feeling. Once I actually got to sleep after the restless leg and other issue, I slept really well on this drug. I won't take it anymore because of the mental exhaustion/restlessness is unbearable.",0,5
Latuda,"This drug was a terrible experience for me. It worsened my depression and anxiety symptoms but one of the most unbearable parts was the restless leg syndrome. I couldn't sleep. I would lay awake for hours with the craziest feeling in my legs. Brain fog. I slowly was weaning off and then quit cold turkey because I wanted this OUT of my system!  All in all, do NOT recommend.",2,5
Latuda,"Horrible medication! It caused me to have medication induced akathesia! I experienced extreme restlessness and uncontrollable tics in my mouth. My legs would continue to jump up and down while sitting! My psychiatrist initially placed me on propranolol to stop these side effects and worked initially. Then, he had to increase the dosage because it came back. Eventually, he had to take me off propranolol and place me on cogentin (Benzotropine mesylate). Cogentin is used for Parkinsons disease. Thats how bad it got! Never again!",1,4
Latuda,"I was recently diagnosed bipolar type 2 with mostly depression episodes. I was before on citalopram for 6 months after burning out in April. Latuda has really helps with the mood swings, I'm much more happy, social and productive. It's effect is almost instant. I'm on 10mg and will up to 20mg soon. The only negative effect I've experienced with Latuda is brain fog. It's been challenging for me as I am a university student. With Citalopram I would get straight As, study long periods and memorize 200 pages in 2 days. With Latuda, I have trouble memorizing a paragraph. I also tend to forget stuff. Psychiatrist says it will get better with time. Even tho I enjoyed Citalopram, I had terrible side effects. With Latuda, none. I finally feel normal.",8,8
Latuda,"Recently started taking Latuda. At first, I started with 40mgs 7 days ago.  Now I am at 80mgs for the first day...overly excited with positive apprehension because I'm excited about the outcome.... I have a positive outlook...",0,9
Latuda,"There were negatives about this drug and I even put off taking it. I ended up starting it and as far as I can tell I have/had no side effects, I felt better quickly, I feel different. My racing mind had come back a little, as seroquel kept racing thoughts under control, I'm all but weaned off seroquel. And Latuda is good. Its been months, since I started Latuda and I dont have a worry about taking it.",9,8
Latuda,"I love Latuda! I haven't felt this good in years. My Dr gave it to me for my depression. I really love how it gives me energy  it also didnt take long to kick in. Problems I have with it: dead sex drive, vaginal problems, and anxiety. Make sure you take it at night so you can sleep through the anxiety. Literally take it right before you go to bed.",7,15
Latuda,"I was put on it the last time I was inpatient and they upped it too much too fast.  I wound up being high off of it.  When I got out of the hospital, my insurance wouldn't cover it, so I stopped cold turkey.  I felt so much better once I got off of it.",1,7
Latuda,"I've had excellent results for my PTSD. I've been on and off one time previously.  Took away fight/ flight anxiety, suicidal ideation, insomnia, and dissociation In just days. I started on 40 this time. Only side effect is some fatigue. I take it at night.  When I needed to discontinue it 6 months ago due to cost,  I didn't have any side effects other than mild passing headache. I also have Bipolar 2, and I went into a happy, productive hypomania after discontinuation.  Thought I felt better too. But 5 months later I crashed. So, Back on the Latuda",0,18
Latuda,"It worked great at 40mg, I had some slight tongue swelling, just thought I needed caffeine because that solved the issue. We upped it to 80mg after 3 years of being on it. Had to go to the hospital for a severe allergic reaction. I kept taking it at 40 but even then the allergic reactions were mild but still happening. Accidentally took it twice within 8 hours and was again taken to the hospital. Some ingredient in there I'm allergic too.",7,6
Latuda,"I took latuda for a little over a year and I had so many side effects. I was so tired all the time, I couldn't function at work and I was a cashier, my throat got smaller, I would gag brushing my teeth and I used to be able to take 3 pills at once without a problem. When I was on latuda I could barely swallow one and I still gagged. I had memory loss, weight gain. I was miserable and I couldn't figure out why. Then I realised that it was latuda. So, I got weaned off of it and I felt 10 million times better, I lost 50lbs since I've been off of it, I can function again, my memory is slowly coming back and I don't gag when I brush my teeth and I can swallow more than one pill without gagging.",1,17
Latuda,I've only been on this med for  5 days and I feel FABULOUS!!!  On my last 40 mg dose today &amp; then upping to 80.  It's been a year of hell on my antidepressants with cycling up &amp; down. I call it the the roller coaster of emotions. My depression would only improve for a short time &amp; then I crashed back down.  I can't believe how amazing I feel in such a short amount of time.  So thankful!!!!,10,23
Latuda,"I started on 20 mg of Latuda for bipolar and anxiety disorder. I felt the same as I always do during the first week of starting latuda. Then I upped it to 40 mg a week later and about an hour later I felt super tired , dizzy , confused , slow heart beat , and UN aware of what was going on around me. And to make it all worse I had trouble sleeping. But I felt so weak like I needed to sleep but couldn't. I'm unsure whether I should continue or discontinue it. Overall rating on this drug would be a 5. Those were terrible side effects and they hit me hard.",5,16
Latuda,"My psych started me on latuda about 6 days ago. I am 32 years old and have suffered from manic bipolar depression for many years. Also with a touch of OCD and severe anxiety. Before latuda I was on ativan for my anxiety. My Dr started me on 40 mg of Latuda and the obvious side effect of nausea did come. But its rather tolerable. My Dr told me there's a trick. Take it after dinner.  After a couple days I have begun to get terrible restless leg syndrome. Talked to my Dr and he put me on klonopin to take 1 hour after latuda. Last night it didn't work.  Overall, my mood is still wishy washy. I am however getting up and doing more. With my depression I haven't been active in sex with my husband as much neither. Let's hope that changes as well.",6,14
Latuda,"I have been taking Latuda for about 6 months for bipolar disorder. I was taking just Seroquel but had breakthrough anxiety and depression, so my psychiatrist added Latuda. It definitely has helped with my depression and anxiety. My big issue is I can only tolerate 10mg/day. Anything more than that and I have severe insomnia. Also, having to take it with 350 calories is a pain. I take it at lunch time. 10mg dose does not make me sleepy. I would warn anybody taking this medication to be careful when stopping it. I abruptly stopped it a few weeks ago and sunk into the worst, deepest, most God awful depression of my life. After a week, I started back on the Latuda and 6 days back on it, I'm feeling better.",7,25
Latuda,"It's been about 6 weeks on Latuda. During this time I experienced joint pain, severe anxiety and panic attacks. I have asked for advice from pharmacists, doctors and other sources. I have Ativan to help with the akathesia. Lamictal started helps with the panic and anxiety but helps the Latuda built up a wall between my brain and body.   And Latuda - I can only sleep a couple hours each night.  No drowsiness here. What I really want is to be titrated down to 20 mg and see if the side effects are negated. Otherwise looking towards seroquel...help!",4,8
Latuda,"Latuda was a great drug for me. The only side effect was it bothered my nerves while I slept. Another thing I HATE about this drug is the price. When I was on it for a month I was laughing, cracking jokes, just really happy. But since I can't afford it I'm on Geodon, and it works fine, I just don't have the happiness that Latuda gave me. When I was on Latuda I was also taking Lithium and Lamictal.",0,16
Latuda,Not very effective for bipolar depression. Now in week 5 of taking med. Extremely expensive and relatively ineffective.,1,14
Latuda,"Latuda didn't even come close to touching my bipolar depression. I kept waiting and waiting for it to work, but nothing happened. I ended up having a horrible depressive episode that almost got me hospitalized. Plus, I had to eat a 350 calorie snack with it, which was always difficult to figure out. On top of that, it would knock me out every night, which would be considered nice...if it didn't knock me out at 7-8pm.",1,21
Latuda,"I used to take it at bedtime, but was getting nauseated.  I switched to taking it with dinner and the nausea has subsided quite a bit. I've gained weight according to the scale, but that's due to constipation the last couple of weeks.  My stomach is sticking out more, but I've actually lost a couple inches everywhere else since being on the meds.  Constipation was already an issue for me, so I don't blame the meds for it.  Overall, it's been great. I'm not angry all the time anymore, no more yelling or crying, no binge eating, etc.  I'm a lot happier and more motivated to do anything and everything.",8,34
Latuda,"I was put on this for anxiety and depression, it didn't help my depression, and it made my anxiety worse. It also made my jaws feel really sore, I was clenching them a lot( not something I normally do) and this just generally gave me an over all uneasy feeling, stopped taking it.",0,19
Latuda,"I started Latuda in 2014 which was the first time I had ever heard of it. I was given it because of my horrible bipolar depression and auditory hallucinations I believe it was 60 or 80 mg. It worked really well. My depression was getting better and everything was going on the right path. Than I started hearing things again so they increased my dose to 120 mg. I never heard anything again. I was always very unmotivated and tired lifeless so to say. Then I moved states and they wouldn't give me the 120 mg so they put me on 80 mg. I was terrified voices would come back but they never did. I had energy, motivation to do things, it was awesome! I have tried multiple like abilify, seroquel, but those literally knock me out since I am not manic.",10,37
Latuda,"Glad works for some. I had nausea vomiting taking it with food. Panic attacks with racing heart rate  which I've never had before. Muscle dyskinesia of jaw. What made it worse was because it wasn't helping my depression , my psych kept upping dose  to see if that worked. Worse drug I've ever been on &amp; hope your caretakers pay attention to your side effects.",1,20
Latuda,"I've been on Latuda for nine weeks now. My first week was 20mg, second week 40 mg, third week 60mg, fourth week 80 mg, fifth week 90 mg, and sixth week 120 mg.  I feel more upbeat. I don't worry like in the past about my job. I used to think people were saying things behind my back.  I lost a few pounds. I am more focused, kind of like being on adderral.  My dosage is at the sweetspot.  I find I have to take it late before I go to sleep otherwise I will want to go to sleep. I use this in combination with Wellbutrin 300mg XL in the morning with one 450 mg of lithium and two 450 mg of lithium at night with the 120 mg of latuda.  The prescription is expensive if you don't have insurance it is 1000 a month, otherwise with insurance its 75 mo.",10,28
Latuda,"I was on seroquel for quite some time and really liked it, but I didn't appreciate the small weight gain or my lack of desire to wake up in the morning. However, it stabilized my mood and gave me the best sleep of my life. My Dr suggested latuda, which I've been taking for about 5 months now at 60 mg. Latuda is also great at stabilizing my mood and no weight gain, but it makes me terribly sick. I'm very nauseous even when I have food in my stomach-sometimes to the point I'm sure I'm going to vomit. It even makes my teeth hurt initially. I want to love this medication as it is truly helpful in mood stabilization, but the induced sickness every time I take it is getting old.",7,26
Latuda,I have been taking Latuda 40mg for nearly 1 month now. Diagnosed Bipolar II since I was in my mid forties. I am now 65 years old. So far this medication has been very effective. No depression for 3 weeks. No hypomania so far. Seroquel worked fairly well but not as well as Latuda. I have lost a few pounds since I started Latuda. I have recieved some samples and will purchase this drug from Canada due to the outrageous cost here in the USA. My Medicare copay is $450.00. In Canada I can get a 30 day supply for about $180.00. Otherwise I would have to take something else and likely much less effective. Latuda is a great medication for me but it is truly incredible and in a way evil that 30 tablets retails for $1200!,9,19
Latuda,I have been on Latuda for over 1 year. I am on 40 mg now. I have become very mean to everyone.  My family has pretty much disowned me. They told me that I should be able to control myself since I know there is a problem.  I have had a hard time getting my doctor to take me off of it. I will show her these reviews tomorrow.,6,8
Latuda,"My experience with Latuda is mostly negative. I have been on it for 5 months and will be tapering off in a couple of weeks thankfully.  The only good thing about it is it stabilized me in a severe mixed mania with psychosis episode, but other than that, the side effects are horrible.  It has done nothing for my depression the past two months and I have had anxiety and major irritability on it.  The nausea and vomiting is miserable.  I was prescribed zofran to offset the nausea but that is not so helpful either since the zofran causes constipation.  The 350 calorie requirement is a pain because you can't take it with dinner or you fall asleep instantly, so I take it with a late night meal to last a few more hours, hence more weight gain.",3,15
Latuda,I initially went on it for depression. It worked great. But years had passed and everyday was the same I was never moving forward. I was forgetting a lot of things. I'm in my 30s I felt as if I was in my 70s when it came to memory. The ability to converse normally decreased over time. I would forget at-least 2 words every few sentences and I would forget obligations and functions. When I went off of it my room was clean for the 1st time my car was clean for the 1st time and for the 1st time I wasn't craving stimulants. I feel alive again.... 3 months off Latuda,2,24
Latuda,"I was on Latuda for about 4-5 months, after taking myself off Seroquel. Latuda seemed promising as it has less metabolic side effects than other atypical antipsychotics. However, Latuda immediately gave me severe anxiety (which added klonopin to my daily regiment). Towards the end of the 4-5 months, I began developing recurring and intense dark thoughts immediately after increasing my Latuda dosage. I instantly took myself off of the drug and am searching for a new atypical antipsychotic to fill its place. I know that Latuda has worked very well for some, but I want to add a warning that it can cause severe anxiety. Monitor your symptoms carefully with your doctor.",3,23
Latuda,"Well let me tell you about this so called latuda.   I started it May 10 2017 20 mg once daily it is now June 7 I stopped cold turkey. I hated it first week lost my voice made my sugar go up, then week two bad muscle pain on right side, week 3 look out the panic attacks started running to ER every other day &amp; bad rash. It might work for some but for  me no I will NEVER EVER take this med again",0,22
Latuda,I've been taking Latuda now for approximately 6 weeks.  I've noticed an increase in my desire to get up and move and overall wellness. I no longer think everyone is out to get me and actually enjoy going to work everyday.  I had trouble falling asleep the first two weeks but that has subsided.  One downfall is my blood pressure has been low (90/60) and has caused some light headedness.  All in all if am also very blessed that my dr. introduced me to Latuda.,0,41
Latuda,"Latuda has made me considerably moodier, over-reactive and mean, and EXTREMELY drowsy.",0,30
Latuda,"Latuda is the fastest acting drug for bipolar depression I've experienced, without side effects. I was frankly dubious about ever finding anything that would work. Dr. prescribed it as an add on to Lamictal, which is a slow-acting drug. I took Latuda at 5 PM and the next day I was feeling noticeably better. On my 3rd day and I feel better than yesterday. If all goes well, this could be a miracle drug for me, even though it's too soon to know. It's been months after a mania episode that I've wind-down to a depressed state, that is not severe but has been constant, where I can't even remember the path to a thought pattern that isn't guilty, hopeless, or without pleasure. I've regained a peace of mind required to get therapeutic learned skills",10,55
Latuda,Did not help depression and caused involuntary facial expressions even after stopping. Permanent... raised sugar diabetic???,1,12
Latuda,Been on Latuda now for about a month.  I've had no side effects and definitely feel much better.  Haven't had any episodes and my depression has subsided.  Couldn't be happier.,9,41
Latuda,"I am taking this for bipolar. I'm not taking it in any combination of other meds. So far I have had only good results. I was told it could have sedative affects but the opposite has been true with me. When I do fall asleep then I sleep just fine. Haven't experienced any weight gain. Latuda  has helped me much more than anything else I have ever taken. I am a veteran and also have PTSD and it has even seemed to help with that. I recommend this drug, just give it a fair try. Some side affects diminish or go away over time.",7,38
Latuda,"I used Latuda for bipolar 2 depression for over a week.  It was very expensive!  I could feel a slight difference, more positive mood after a week, but nausea even after taking pill after a full large meal.  The reason I stopped taking it was because two hours after taking the pill, I would fall asleep.  Not just be tired but actually fall asleep at work.  The naps I would take after taking the pill when at home were not fully rested, I would get chills, had to have layers of blankets for 3-4 hours.  Then once I woke up I would feel fine but it would have ruined my sleep pattern for the night ahead.  I think it will work well for someone who does wont experience those side effects.  I would give it a try.  Stay positive!",3,19
Latuda,I have bipolar 2. Lamotrigene 400mg of lamotrigene has taken away anger and irritability. I was still crying over everything so my psychitrist put me on latuda 20 mg for 1 month. First week projectile vomiting every other day for a week. Saw no benefit. I was bumped to 40. Immediately I felt semi anxious. Day 5 almost had a panic attack out of the blue. This med is not right for me. It really scared me how anxious and panicky I became on 40 mg. I am stopping after I call my doctor.,3,21
Latuda,"I was on 20mg at night. It helped to clear my head from severe manic and help get me closer to stable, but, I had read all the reviews so was familiar and was prepared for all side effects...except one. I have hypoglycemia  (low blood sugar), which of course is very unpredictable and hard to control as it is. I normally have an episode once or twice a week. But within 2 weeks of taking latuda, I was having 4 to 6 major episodes a day. I called my Dr. and we agreed that it was best I stop it immediately and we would try something else. I do take another medication, so this was to just help bring me back up out of a severe manic until I am more stable.",0,14
Latuda,"I consider this drug, which I've been on since 2012, the backbone of my psychiatric treatment, although my regimen also includes Lamictal and Wellbutrin. When I first took it I was shocked because the next day I went to the gym to work out, something I hadn't been able to do/enjoy in quite some time due to anhedonia. Initially as my doctor had me titrating up I experienced some TD at night, but that soon abated. Now, at 80 mg nightly, I still rely on this medication to keep me functional. It didn't put weight on me either. I had some issues with health insurance this year and was forced to go off of it and boy did I feel a difference. It really lifts my depression. Thank God I'm back on it again.",10,31
Latuda,"I've only been on latuda 2 weeks (20 mg) so I'm rating this medication based on short-term use.  It's been wonderful so far. I've been on Lamictal + Neurontin for the past year and a half, and I was rapidly cycling instead of feeling genuinely stable or good.  Latuda has really stabilized me. I feel good every day, if not really good/great. I have energy, but not manic/frenzied/restless. Good mood for me always carried the additional symptom of manic/tormenting agitation.  I was afraid to take an antipsychotic because of the fear of weight gain. However, I have had no weight gain so far on Latuda. My appetite has been the same.  I am also sleeping well. Latuda helps me fall asleep. No major side effects.",9,25
Latuda,"I was put on Latuda recently after switching from Zyprexa because Zyprexa made me extremely fatigued. Latuda doesn't make me as tired except for when I'm driving, when I feel like I'm about to fall asleep at the wheel and sometimes do close my eyes. In addition I'm hungrier than normal and even though I'm only eating 1,000 calories or less a day and am exercising at least 4 times a week I am not losing weight. I feel like I am suffering pointlessly for this. It hasn't helped my depression either. I am irritable a lot of the time and am still having mood swings. I think it may be time for me to quit meds for good. They haven't worked for anyone else in my family so why should they work for me? I need to get off of them.",4,17
Latuda,"Today is day 3 on Latuda. First night I had to take a xanax to go to sleep, day 2 I fell asleep in my own.  Tonight I still have no symptoms.  I'm feeling better after 3 days. I am highly sensitive to medication and was extremely frightened to start it.  I'm very happy so far.",10,34
Latuda,"Very  good medication.  I tolerated it well.  Makes me very relaxed, and calm mood.  But tired and little motivation.",9,19
Latuda,"The first week and a half was unbearable. Severe anxiety, depression, and crazy vivid nightmares... then it was like a light was switched on and everything felt great. I was just upped to 40mg a week ago today and now I am back to severe anxiety, depression, and vivid nightmares... I really hope this pulls through for me once again or I am going back down to 20mg. My relationship was blossoming now I feel we are struggling once more, I refuse to lose my happiness due to this mental disorder!",7,24
Latuda,"Took for one month in the midst of a deep depression (2 weeks at 20mg, then 2 weeks at 40mg).  It flipped me into a mixed mania - even worse - so I discontinued it, but not before it jacked my weight up 15 lbs.",1,19
Latuda,"Horrible drug!  My doctor tried it as augmentation therapy for my depression, to take with my Trintellix.  The starting baby dose of 20mg flew me over the edge in two weeks.  I became angry, agitated, and very aggressive.  A neighbor make me so angry coming out of our condo parking garage the wrong way that I later slit tires on his car.  Not at all like me!  Thank God he accepted payment for new tires and didn't press charges.  Perhaps the nastiest med I have ever taken. And VERY expensive without good insurance.",1,19
Latuda,"I have been on the medicine exactly 1 month for my Depression with severe anxiety . The first 3 weeks I was on 20mg, and the first week and a half was the absolute worst. Everything felt wrong, my relationship, my job, my whole life... but I have been feeling this way for quite some time... I also got very vivid dreams and nightmares. However after a week and a half (my boyfriend says this as well) it is like a light switched on inside my head and everything got better. Not fantastic but a whole lot better. Yeah there were issues in my life and my relationship has been rocky but I had optimism and felt love that I had not felt in a long time &lt;3 5 days ago, I was increased to 40mg and here comes the absolute worst again... but this time I KNOW it will get better. Don't give up!",8,18
Latuda,I was on Latuda for a week and it made me way worse.  Now that I'm off of it the depression is much worse.,1,11
Latuda,It has been working since going from 20mg to 40mg I am able to deal with stress better decreased rage. But I have noticed decreased appetite and decreased sex drive. Will be looking at adding other meds to bring up my mood. I still get depression symptoms throughout the week not all days. I am reluctant to increase my dosage to 60mg will try it out for a few more weeks have been on it for almost 3 months,8,19
Latuda,My husband was recently diagnosed with being bipolar and psychologist up his latuda from 20 mg to 60mg and I feel like that is a huge jump.,0,6
Latuda,"Relieved symptoms of severe depression but caused terrible, debilitating dry eyes.  I have mild dry eye disease under normal circumstances, and dry eyes are *not* listed as a side effect for Latuda.  It got to the point though where I was unable to do anything because of my dry eye discomfort.  I got severely tense and anxious, which kind of negated any positive effect from the Latuda.  So, we stopped it, and my dry eyes went away.",5,11
Latuda,"I'm hoping my comments reaches out to those who like me gave up on medication time and time again as it affected their work outs. As a long distance runner and someone suffering from years of major PTSD and Anxiety, it was nearly impossible to have the stamina to run while on meds. I'd have to grin and bear the struggles of my PTSD without meds during my years of marathon training. Cymbalta and Latuda have been the perfect combination for me. Though Latuda is more for Bi-Polar, it has helped many people with PTSD, like myself. I have no weight gain and I have plenty of stamina to do my running. I'm so grateful to God and my doctor for finding the best program for me. If you're an athlete, help is out there.",10,67
Latuda,Latuda was horrible in my case. I was so wound up I couldn't sleep or sit down. I had what felt like all day long panic and even a Xanax didn't stop it. I was sweating and hyperventilating and felt a constant choking sensation I think from panicking. This is my experience it may be someone else's miracle drug. It did ease the depression and mood swings but the side effects were not worth it. On the plus side I gave it a 3 because I was never hungry and dropped 20 pounds.,3,24
Latuda,"While some give high ratings, I cannot. Within a week of starting it, it gave me what seemed like full-day long panic attacks and I wept for hours. I would later find out it was akathisia which wreaked havoc on my anxiety and paranoia. Not for me!",1,15
Latuda,"I have been on latuda for two years.  I increased the first time and slept like a baby (I had terrible insomnia and nightmares on 20 mg).  I just increased my dose to 60 mg and now I'm back to waking up every single night at 3:00 am and feel wide awake.  I also have very vivid dreams on this med.  However, it controls my symptoms so well that I won't stop taking it.  It is the only medication in its class that works for me.  I miss sleeping well, but the benefits outweigh the risks for me.  Just in case anyone is wondering, when it's combined with gabapentin at night, I have no trouble sleeping, so I'll definitely add that back into the mix.",7,31
Latuda,"This med had saved my life!!! I was addicted to heroin and xanax trying to always self medicate the effects of bipolar. I tried so many meds and had so many dangerous side effects like a bad rash from lamictal and muscles locking up from 3 other meds and had to get rushed to the hospital to get Benadryl shots. Ever since I've been on this I feel like I did when I was a kid very free and level, no crazy obsessive thoughts or cravings. I have not had a drug craving at all, nor do I want anything to do with drugs bc now that my mind is clear and balanced I have no use for them . This med definitely is the main thing helping me stay sober and it saved me from myself and my thoughts!!!!!",9,67
Latuda,"This is the best drug I have taken for bipolar. I took many drugs for bipolar and this one seems to be the only one to work. Zero side effect medication. It's like haldol, but without side affects. Take it, trust me. It's great for bipolar. Decreases your appetite, unlike other medication. You will lose weight and sleep well. Start off at a high dose, because lower doses don't affect you well enough. I'm 25 in June and definitely, highly, recommend this medication for anyone with any type of bipolar.",0,48
Latuda,"I am on two AAPs for my bipolar. Zyprexa which handles my anger, and Latuda which helps my intrusive thoughts. I have only been on it for a little over a month. Was on 40mg, was convinced that it wasn't doing anything for me and told my psych I wanted to come off of it. She tapered me down to 20mg for a week and was supposed to stop after that. After reducing down to 20mg the intrusive thoughts returned. I went back to my old ways of blockading my front door out of fear of an intruder, and not leaving my apt at night (zero rational reasoning for my actions). Called my dr and went back up to 40mg as of today. Will not be quitting.",9,37
Latuda,After being on seroquel and then shortly zyprexa I was put on latuda 40 mg. It gave me a lot of anxiety and strong restless feelings so I dropped to 20 mg and it helped. I've since gone back up to 40 mg because 20 wasn't helping all my symptoms. It helps a lot with suicidal thoughts and negative obsessive thoughts and I've noticed I've lost weight on it. The anxiety can be kinda unbearable at times but in the overall scheme it seems to be worth it. I would go up to a higher dose but my insurance won't cover it. I take it at night with something to eat and if I do have uncomfortable feelings they go away within a couple hours. Overall I would say it's a pretty good med but be careful because it is pretty potent even at low doses.,7,30
Latuda,"my doctor gave me latuda because I wanted to stop zyprexa and seroquel because of the weight gain. She told me that latuda doesn't cause weight gain. I took 40mg and it seem to work pretty well it wasn't as great as zyprexa but it worked well........but I had to stop because even though my insurance covered the drugs, the copay cost me $500 which I obviously cannot afford. So am going cold turkey on everything.....why cant I just be normal?",8,26
Latuda,This drug is very affective but the side effects are kinda crappy!!! I would get stiffness in my neck and spasms in my back that were hard to deal with.,4,17
Latuda,"This medication should not be being prescribed for Bipolar 2, a milder form of a different illness, called Biploar 1, for which this medication works very well. Folks, Doctors NEED to be using SCIENCE to treat illnesses, not giving out random prescriptions for 2+ medications for 1 illness. If your Doctor is not doing monthly blood tests AT LEAST to see how the medications are affecting your body chemistry and serotonin levels, then you need to fire the Doctor and find one who does do his/her job the right way, and who is good at the science part of the job. Every medication you take counteracts and interacts with the other medications and the foods and other things that you put into your body each day messing with the chemistry of your body",6,22
Latuda,I have type 2 BP along with many other things and I do say I love this RX. It helped me out for a very long time one of the first and few. However I did feel very dulled emotionally. I was on 140mg daily but any does lower did not work. I could not even cry unless something absolutely tragic (Ie. Death or someone I loved getting hurt) happened in my life. Also I hated having to take it with food. I constantly had an upset stomach as I could never seem to get eating and taking the med right. So all in all I took myself off from the med and the withdrawls from it were hell. For about two weeks I felt like I was dying. So as a conclusion; this med does work and work well if you like being a robot who vomits.,7,22
Latuda,I've been on it for 1.2 weeks. started at 20 and now up to 40 mg. I was so scared to try this medicine because unfortunately I have a side effect to just about every anti-psychotic except Seroquel. They tend to make my eyes roll back I can bring them down to look at you but then they stay stuck up. Not even Cogentin helps. I am so excited because this has not happened with the Latuda yet. I am down 6.4 pounds. And I feel great. My appetite is very curb. Unfortunately my first week I had a lot of anxiety. And one very bad day. But all of that has seemed to subside. My stomach has been upset... But I'm willing to take the bad... Because I'm getting so much good,9,32
Latuda,"Latuda is the first antipsychotic I've taken, and I have to say it works. Yeah nausea sets in if you don't eat with it but it's been pretty fine. Started with 20 MG for the past 6 months, and auditory hallucinations diminished at least 90%. Anxiety about 60% which is why I'm looking to up my dosage to 40mg along with upping my zoloft dosage to 100mg.But with any medicine there are side effects and diarrhea is an issue with this medication. So, with my uptake in dosage hopefully I'll be all the way me again.",8,23
Latuda,"I have experienced some side effects otherwise I would rate this as a 10. Watch what you eat and pick the right time to take it. The first few days I had side effects that lasted for a few hours. After the side effects wore off, I felt amazing. I have Bipolar Depression that I feel is very bad. Most people think I am ok. However, there is so much going on in my head all the time. Latuda has helped me to feel good and stay focused. I am able to have more control over my life. I have tried different meds and this one has worked well for me. I have taken it and night, but switched to the day due to sleep issues. Sleep issues are better now.",9,39
Latuda,"I had been on Seroquel since 1997 and had gained a lot of weight.  I also had the side effects of type 2 diabetes, high cholestoral, etc. from taking it so long.  But Seroquel worked for me.  So in an effort to loose weight and the bad side effects I switched to Latuda.  Lutuda didn't do squat for me in the sleep department, so I ended up taking a half pill of Seroquel and a dose of Latuda.  This worked well for about a year.  I lost a ton of weight and my overall health improved.  However, I slipped into a major depressive episode in less than a year and had to go back to the tried and true Seroquel.  Feeling better, but gained back a lot of weight.  Never thought a drug marketed for BP depression would make me depressed.",2,14
Latuda,"I recently started taking Latuda and couldn't be more please with it. For many years I have been struggling psychologically, have been on variety of different depression medication that offer no help or even worsen my symptoms. I been diagnosed with PTSD, Chronic Depression in 2008, and 2015 also diagnosed with Bipolar. I am quite disappointed that I wasn't introduced to Latuda earlier. Latuda  has enhanced the quality of my life in so many great ways. Not only that I feel better and happier, I am a better mother and a girlfriend. Latuda not only help with Bipolar, but it addressed all my mental problems. I am finally able to feel normal and have a normal life!",10,42
Latuda,"Developed memory loss, (MMSE 16/30) , developed total body neuralgia, developed instability, developed cogging (regitity of muscle tone), developed Parkinsonian symptoms,",1,19
Latuda,"I'm on Latuda, the side effects are very irritating and scary! This time my RIGHT leg has that very unbearable (hard to explain) feeling, I fell asleep a lot at work, right in the middle of me writing something, I stumbled around and thinking it will be better if I took it at night, it WASN'T! I woke up at 1am, having EXTREME panic attacks, overthinking EVERYTHING and just have these terrible, horrifying thoughts! I got outta bed and slipped, fell down the stairs and hurt my arm and knee! I also drooled a lot and had no appetite for 3 months!! But on the other side, it makes me calmer/happier and confident about things, but I can't stand the side effects!!",4,30
Latuda,"I've been on latuda for about two months. I had been taking Risperdal and Lamictal for years and while I was getting by I wasn't in such a great mood often. Shortly after taking this I noticed I felt much happier and my therapist and girlfriend both said I seem less inhibited and in a better mood. It's not like I'm manic and I don't feel like the happiness is some artificial shot in the arm. I'm perfectly lucid and at peace with things most of the time. That all being said I also have more frequent mood swings. The swings aren't as bad as when I'm off meds, but I do feel pretty down about 10 to 20 times a month with episodes lasting various amounts of time. I'm currently taking 20mg latuda and 300mg Lamictal.",8,29
Latuda,I was diagnosed with bi polar in 12/28/2015.. It has been very hard from then until now. I first was on lithium it didn't work for me. I was still maniac. I switched doctors and was put on lithium. My doctor called it the Mercedes of meds.. So I went with it.  It took 4 months to see a difference.. I had to takes meds faithfully.  9 months and Latuda has changed my life. I did gain weight. Now I'm working out on getting it off..,10,15
Latuda,"This has literally been a life saver.  I tried to taper off it twice and my mood became very volatile, that resolved once I went back on it.  Latuda in combination with lamotrigine has improved my quality of life immensely.",10,33
Latuda,"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 3.5 years ago. Initially, I took Lamictal and Saphris for one year. Saphris made me too drowsy too often, so now I take Lamictal and Latuda (60mg).  I recommend taking Latuda at night with food. If I take it in the morning or during the day, I get very restless and can't still still or focus on anything. I have no problems if I take it right before bed with a snack.",8,24
Latuda,"I started latuda after being on abilify since 2004. I was taken off abilify because I began vomiting every day and had severe rashes after being on the drug for about twelve years. Latuda is HORRIBLE! Mind you, I haven't actually had a serious psychiatrist sit down and actually understand my symptoms or who I am in about five years... seems as if that is non existent in my region or something now? I developed severe migraines on latuda, and have had more frequent seizures on this medication. The doctor I have seen ONE time this entire year doesn't want to work with me even though he even noticed I am extremely agitated and annoyed ALL the time on this medication. I used to be very calm and easy going; however, now everything irritates me.",1,23
Latuda,"i have Bipolar type II and took it for a couple months and it left me feeling constantly on edge. i couldnt relax and watch a movie with my boyfriend or even just sit and read a book without feeling anxious. I don't know for sure if I have anxiety but it definitely made me very anxious. it didn't help my moods either cause I was constantly on edge and anything triggered an episode for me. but I know a few people it helped out, just not for me. one thing I will say is if you take it TAKE IT BEFORE BED WITH FOOD. taking with food helps your body absorb it, and taking it before bed helps with the anxious part for some.",2,27
Latuda,"None. I was prescribed this by my specialist as an alternative to lamotrigine for some unknown reason. I took a look at the side effects and decided it was incompatible with being able to work. After all, if I can't work, I can't afford treatment.",1,10
Latuda,"This is the best medication I've taken for a mood stabilizer.  It takes about 3 months to work at peak, but the benefits have been amazing. While some medications seem to drag you to feeling better,  this one just nudges me. I feel as if My Real personality can show through. I'm stable and thinking more rationaly, without losing the ability to feel my emotions. Plus, I lost a few pounds.",10,54
Latuda,"Before starting Latuda, I was weepy and sad nearly all the time.  I rarely slept well and just felt sad and sleepy all the time.  Latuda changed my life.  I am not sad and weepy anymore and I sleep great every night.   This medicine is just what I had prayed for.  I feel so normal now.",10,47
Latuda,"16 years of bipolar1 all symptoms extremely difficult. Latter years mania faded to a all consuming depression.I fought it refusing to take antidepressants.it was to dark I gave in and tried Seroquel.it helped then I tried Latuda 20mg. helped immediately then to 40mg where I have been for 2 years,Thank and Praise God!!!",8,42
Latuda,"I've been on Atudau for about 6 weeks now. I wanted an alternative to taking serequel as at 300mg it was starting to make me feel like binge eating due to severe appetite increase from 200mg to 300mg. I have been diagnosed with Bipolar, no specific type, but I know I have rapid cycling Bipolar and I have experienced psychosis, I don't need a shrink to tell me this as I know how I feel, without sounding arrogant. I take 80mg of Latuda at night together with 500mg of Epilium. In the morning I take 10mg of Brintilix (anti-depressant) together with 500mg of Epilum. After suffering with Bipolar and mood disorders, I have finally found a medication which makes me feel normal and fits in with my personality. I definitely would recommend this",0,26
Latuda,"Horrible, evil pill. Didn't realize it was causing me anxiety after being EPC for false statements, they put me on it in the hospital and I was like sure okay. They rapidly ramped me to 60mg, the anxiety/nervousness from it was intense, crippling and basically made me botch an easy in and out hearing where my family fully supported me - they weren't even allowed in to testify to the falseness of why I was EPC'd cause i shut down and said no contest to total BS.  This drug is known for causing people to be violent. I can sort of see why it might do that. It's immensely powerful, and the doctors like to give out a needlessly high dose. The irony is, the doc I have now says I'm not even bipolar.",1,23
Latuda,"I am 58 with diagnosis received over 15 years ago.  I have tried several antidepressants and antianxiety medication with little if any relief.  Upon expressing frustration with my doctor, it was suggested to try latuda.  I am on day 8 of 20 mg.  Almost immediately felt calmer, clearer thinking, interest in my forgorgotten enjoyments.  I am in good health physically.  So far, no signs of any side affects and no weight gain at all (I gain weight easily) and gained over 20 lbs over the years using celexa and other antidepressants.  My diagnosis was changed after 14 years to bipolar 1 same doctor all these years.  I was afraid of medicines but deep depression forced me to try again. I'm happy so far with latuda. Good luck and God bless.",8,57
Latuda,"I am currently taking 80mg of Latuda (which I've been on for about 5 weeks now). I take this in conjunction with 500mg of Sodium Valproate, twice daily and 10mg of Brintillex (anti-depressant). I was diagnosed with Bipolar last year and have been battling to feel normal per se. The increase doses of Seroquel just made me want to binge eat as it increased my appetite when I was on 300mg. Latuda has helped me significantly........... No weird emotional feelings or thoughts. I feel comfortable in 'my own body', I feel content been 'on my own', relaxed and 'chilled'. The only downside is the cost as it is not covered on the pharmaceutical benefit scheme here in Australia (only for diagnosis of Schizophrenia); therefore it cost me $AUD150.",0,20
Latuda,This medicine has changed my life!! I have battled depression for years. Although my psychiatrist had me on more than 1 antidepressant I would still have days I would get up and be in a black hole. I never knew how long it would last - days or weeks. My diagnosis was Major Depressive Disorder - Reoccurring. I just couldn't understand with all the meds why I still struggled so much with the monster of depression. I talked to my psychiatrist about it and he started Latuda. The sky is bluer the grass is greener and I know what joy is!,10,64
Latuda,"I started Latuda 20mg 5 months ago with no results until a few weeks later, increasing dosage to 40mg. Felt pretty good, the depression &amp; anxiety improved, but still not balanced. 6 weeks ago, I increased my dosage of Wellbutrin from 150mg to 300mg and finally felt really good for a change!  But now the past 3-4 wks, I feel I am in hypermania, as all the signs are there... I'm talking fast and a lot, making purchases online, which I don't normally do, and sleep is sketchy!  Since I, like most, prefer mania over all other moods, I haven't contacted my therapist yet, because I know more changes to medications is imminent, before I crash and go into deep depression.  One last try with Latuda, increasing the dosage to 80mg next week.",9,21
Latuda,I've taken a lot of medications. I was prescribed latuda and it wasnt a very good experience. I couldn't even sit down to watch a movie without feeling jittery and needing to be on the go. When it was bed time my legs were so restless I couldn't sleep. I would lay in bed kicking my legs non stop. I'll never take this again.,3,28
Latuda,"Med change epilum to latuda over 8 weeks.. Ok, the change started off great, I'd been in bipolar depression for almost a year, after 2 days on latuda I was activated and over the moon happy, ok far far too happy.  First day was like ecstasy.  2 months past and everything was fine, I'd come out of depression.. but the honeymoon took an abrupt ending when side effects / made it the most undesirable experience.  Intense anxiety. dread, panic, restless legs, fear, suicidal thoughts (never had those before, ever)  back to the doc, changed dosage and combinations a couple of times under his supervision but it didn't work. Went completely off it and back to my long time friends seroquel xr &amp; epilum..",3,26
Latuda,"For me, latuda is the best drug available and so far I've lost 25lbs. My emotions are in check, paranoia and hallucinations are gone. I feel real and as close to normal than I've been in a really, really long time. Other than a slight tremor, I've noticed no other side effects I'd highly recommend trying this medication.",10,50
Latuda,"I've been taking Latuda for about 3 months now for Bipolar II disorder. At first, I started out at 20 mg, and gradually increased to 80 mg. I was in a deep depression, so even within weeks of taking Latuda, I didn't feel that much better. Once my doc switched me to 80 mg, I slowly started climbing out of my depression. It was a slow recovery, but it worked. I am now 80% depression-symptom free and I feel like I'm back to my old self. I am able to function much better at work and life in general. I had restlessness as a side-effect for some time, but it slowly went away. I usually take Latuda before bedtime and haven't experienced any other side effects.",9,51
Latuda,So tonight was my first 20mg Latuda at dinner and I was super afraid that akathesia (a restlessness from taking antipsychotic pills) would happen. But so far so good. I guess some people get it and some dont.,5,17
Latuda,The worst antipsychotic I've ever taken. I could barely walk and my rigidity was so bad my legs seized up totally.,1,22
Latuda,I used to be at a mental state where everyday I would lie on my bed for about 3 hours because I didn't want to do anything. I had severe suicidal thoughts for 2 years and kept switching medications because they caused weight gain. After about a week of taking the medication my weight started dropping and my grades shot up to b's instead of c's. Now I'm doing great. I've never had higher grades and haven't felt this good for years. I'd really recommend it. I haven't had side effects yet and probably won't.,10,49
Latuda,Started Latuda several months ago.  I couldn't be happier.  This medication is changing my life ( years of instability).  Up to 80mg daily.  The only side effect I notice is weight loss; which is fine by me.,10,45
Latuda,"I switched this from Ability and the difference is night and day - energized, happy and manic free. I follow the rules to a tee - take at night with a minimum 350 calories - I noticed some posts here reporting vomiting and ineffectiveness - it's not just about stomach upset - you MUST take the med on a full stomach or it wont be absorbed properly and will likely cause upset too - this is what my Doc tells me and he seems to be right",10,42
Latuda,"I was first put on Abilify for 1.5 years for bipolar 2 disorder. On abilify I gained 60lbs and was never in a stable state although it did help some. I still would get manic a lot and hypersexual. I was then placed on rexulti for a couple months, it kept me ok but not stable. I would still get hypersexual &amp; horrible ups &amp; downs. Now I've been placed on Latuda by a new psychiatrist. I'm starting on 20mg and its already changed my life! I feel normal and have real emotions! Tonight I'm starting 40mg and in two weeks starting 60mg. I'm so happy Latuda was made. I've already started loosing weight within a week!",10,46
Latuda,I started taking latuda and had to stop due to pregnancy but prior to pregnancy I was taking latuda 40mg and vybriid and the two work amazing wonders together,9,9
Latuda,"Update on Haldol and Zofran ODT.  MD Inc my dose of Latuda from 80mg to 120mg. After 1 hr of taking Latuda I got violent severe vomiting daily x 8 days despite use of antiemetics.  I told MD I quit, no illness is worth this.  He suggested 40mg in AM and 80mg in PM. SO here is my regimen.  Upon awaking take 0.5mg Haldol, after 1 hr eat minimum requirements 350 cal ( to make Latuda work best), then take Zofran 4mg ODT and wait 20 min and take Latuda.  Repeat in PM.  NO N/V x 7 days - yeah.  Hoping this will last because running out of drugs to use and Latuda has worked best.  Also on lamictal and Vyvanse for cyclic bipolar ( diagnosed when I was 60!).",0,18
Latuda,"Worst medication I've ever taken! Made me sick daily, neausish. Took with food threw up.  Took 30 minutes after eating food and threw up. After taking this medication I had increased anxiety. Worst drug I've ever been on.",0,23
Latuda,"Just started on this medication for bipolar II disorder and I also have borderline personality disorder according to the psychiatrists. I switched from abilify because I had a recent suicide attempt while on it. After starting latuda, I have not experienced any lows but it is hard to tell if it is the medication or the nature of my mood swings. Haven't felt hypomanic in quite a while however. Just note, it is important to take this med with at least 350 calories of food because that will allow the drug levels to reach an optimal concentration in your body, otherwise the drug is not doing too much. I am a pharmacist so I know quite a bit about drugs.",7,49
Latuda,"Bipolar 2 cyclic .started with Serequil, lamictal and Vyvanse. Serequil worked but horrible side effects: urine retention. Daily HA, All day long nausea, weight gain 22#. Despite watching diet and daily swim.  Started  Latuda Took 40mg  at dinner (8pm) for 4 week. what a great mood stabilizer for me but still having periodic days of mania and depression. Inc to 80 MG. Doing great. Within 3 weeks of starting Latuda lost 20 lbs ( almost like my metabolism kicked into overdrive) after being on Serequil.  side effects:  my stomach super sensitive so of course nausea.  I must take 1 hr after dinner, letting food digest, no alcohol. Otherwise vomiting within 2 hrs after taking. I take RX haldol 0.5mg BID and Zofran ODT for breakthrough nausea",10,26
Latuda,"I was put on latuda 20 several months ago. It made my insomnia worse, increased my racing thoughts and I felt like I was in a constant state of panic. After discussing all of this with the doctor, she doubled the dosage. After 2 weeks with maybe an hour of sleep a night, no appetite, a constant racing mind, and disabling panic, I sought the advice of my PCP. He has been treating me for more than 10 years now and ordered me to immediately discontinue it. I'm not completely cured by any means but the excessive symptoms are much more tolerable and I can usually sleep now.",1,16
Latuda,I started Latuda about a month ago so far I feel amazing. My negative thoughts (voices in my head) are not gone but more positive and not so attacking. I havnt had any erges in my body to yell scream or cry for no reason. I havnt yet to pop off quick like I did before I have no feeling to even be upset. I'm Feeling as if iv let go of all the bad energy I had inside me. A lot more tired and restless I'm sure I will get more use to it later but it's help me not wake up in a panic like I did everyday before. I would truly recommend to anyone who just wants to figure out who they truly are somone who wants consistency with there self If that makes sense? I love the person I am now and I hope to keep feeling this way. Good luck,8,58
Latuda,"Latuda, mood stabilizer (trilleptal 300 twice daily) and anti depressant (Effexor 150 once in morning) have helped so much. I've felt like a Guinea pig the last two decades with different drugs and different Drs telling me conflicting things. The one thing they all agree on is I'm bi polar II, PTSD disorder and borderline personality. What they couldn't agree on is what to give me. I've been on more medications than I can count and the only one that ever has not only WORKED for me but has little to no ugly side effects (for me) has been this combination which was stumbled upon one of the many times I've been hospitalized for despression or suicide attempt. Ever since then Latuda has been a must in my daily life. 40mg once at night.",9,35
Latuda,"Just started taking Latuda 2 days ago.  I may be psychologically thinking it's starting to work already.  But I know it's just wishful thinking.  Been on 20mg of Prozac, 100mg of Lamictal, .5mg Ativan &amp; 100mg of trazadone for 15 years.  Hopefully I can quit the Prozac altogather.  Will see, very hopeful.",5,18
Latuda,"I am 58 and was diagnosed with Bipolar II and ADHD. I'm currently on Latuda 20 mg, Lamictal 300 mg, Cymbalta 60 mg, and Vyvanse 40 mg per day. Before Latuda I would stay in bed for months and considered suicide. Within a week of starting it I was motivated, hopeful and energetic. I do experience significant restlessness, a weird anxiety and hyperventilating about 2 hrs after taking it--it also makes me drowsy-- so I eat about 8 pm, take it (you must take Latuda with at least 350 cal for proper absorption of the med) and go to bed about 10. It doesn't bother me while I'm asleep. Unfortunately, I have noticed a return of some depressive symptoms lately. I tried 40 mg, but the side effects are too severe. :(",8,24
Latuda,"Been on latuda about 3 weeks now. The only down fall is staying asleep for the whole night. I go to bed around 10pm and i wake up about one hour later feeling restless. Doctor told me to take melitonin before bed. I'll see if that works. Also,like someone above my message said. My doctor ask me to go off the medication and notice the signs of depression again and see what the medication has been doing. So true. After 3 days off the medication,I notice my symptoms of anger and impulsiveness  return, also my depression hitting hard again. So am going back on after today and staying on. Its finally a miracle that I can be symptoms free and no more racing thoughts. Thank you medicine.",9,42
Latuda,Been on latuda 20mg for almost 3 weeks now. I definitely notice a difference in my mood. I dont feel so heavy and down. Im glad to finally have some relief. I also notice that my anxiety is not as high and im not angry all the time. I hope things go up from here. Im very positive about this medicine.,8,52
Latuda,"This drug is AMAZING! My negativr thoughts and mood swings are a Thing of the past.. FINALLY! Ive been on prozac, cymbalta, and fetzima (last one made me manic).. This is finally the one that worked for me! No side effects as of yet on 20 mg for 3 weeks.. Give it a Try for stabilizing mood",10,63
Latuda,"I have recently been diagnosed BP 2.  I spent years being depressed with one suicide attempt.  I had been taking fluoxetine for 10+ years.  When I finally went to a psychiatrist he took put me on Latuda and Lamictal.  What a difference!   My primary care asked me to go off the Latuda for a few days and I definitely noticed a difference for the worse.  Latuda and Lamictal have saved my life, I am much more productive, motivated and happy.",10,64
Latuda,"I switched from Zyprexa to Latuda about 2 months ago. At first, I was having a little bit of trouble staying asleep. Now, I feel much more energized when I wake up. It keeps symptoms at bay. I was also able to lose almost 50 pounds (through diet and exercise). It is possible to lose weight on this drug as you are not constantly thinking about food and feeling sluggish. Definitely recommend for those looking for an alternative.",10,61
Latuda,"Been on it for two months. Didn't notice a difference to three weeks taken it. Started sleeping through the night with vivid dreams, but my dreams are always vivid. Depression got bad, but seems to be letting up. My doctor wants me to take it in the morning, but I sleep most of the day, and feel like crap till the afternoon. Plus the restlessness during the day is miserable. On 40mg now, and going to start taking it at night. I can take it on an empty stomach with no problems. Will see what happens. Was seriously thinking of stop taken it, but reading these reviews really helped. That I wasn't the only one with some of these issues. I thank you all!! One last thing I'm Bipolar ll mixed manic, and people have notice that I'm calmer.",5,30
Latuda,I started taking Latuda a month ago and it is the most debilitating drug I've ever hadi feel like I can't move or have any motivation to do anything. Ive also gained 20 pounds. Im absolutely miserable. Do not take this! It's not worth feeling like a slug all day.,1,28
Latuda,"I've been on latuda 40mg for 1.5 years. In 2012 I was hospitalized after a manic episode - hallucinating and not eating or sleeping for 2 days. Hospitalized in 2014 for another manic episode. I was prescribed latuda 40 mg, haven't changed  since then. I also started seeing a Christian therapist after my 2nd episode.  I don't always take my latuda with food, and rarely after dinner (otherwise I get restless and anxious). But so far I have been healthy mentally, no manic episodes, no major depressive states. This year I have even lost 10-12lbs, but I'm very active now. I don't have a history of drug use, never been medicated before this, but family history of mental health issues.",0,46
Latuda,"Diagnosed with Bipolar II and Schizophrenia. At first this was the wonder drug. Now, as I'm 1 year into it, my daily functionality has significantly decreased. I take this with 50mg Vyvanse just to wake up enough to work. I can't verbally communicate any more, even with friends or my wife. It's affecting my work. My tongue clicks and my legs shake uncontrollably. No motivation. No emotional reactions except strong anger outbursts. I will sleep 18+ hrs a day if I can.",5,28
Latuda,I have been on latuda for 3-4 years at 40 mg. I also take celexa for my bipolar 1 disorder . The latuda has helped me feel better but the weight gain of 50 lbs I put on has depressed me to the point that I stopped taking latuda this week. So far I have just experienced some insomnia and racing thoughts. I pray that these symptoms will pass soon. I am looking into treating my bipolar1 with vitamins and minerals. If you have any suggestions or thoughts please share them. I am hoping to lose all the weight I gained. Thank you and God Bless.,3,26
Latuda,"I have Bipolar 1 and I started taking Latuda 20mg and didn't feel too much to begin with other than it was easier to get up in the morning, then I went up to 40mg and started really feeling amazing improvements. I used to suffer from extreme paranoid thoughts, had little cognitive ability, was constantly having panic attacks and felt extremely depressed, didn't sleep yet was barely awake during the day and was basically just sluggish and useless. On Latuda I can get up in the morning, I sleep at night, my paranoid thoughts a greatly reduced, my panic attacks have more than halved, I can actually think, I'm not too sleepy and depressed to look after myself and after two years of being disinterested in everything I feel enthusiastic again!",9,96
Latuda,I have been on Latuda for over three years. My cycles are very rapid and this drug has saved my life. I take one 120mg pill at night. Wow what a difference. My mania is under control and I have less episodes of depression. Having a dual diagnosis I am very comfortable with this medication. I was on lithium for over 11 years and that worked well until I almost had kidney failure due to toxic drug levels. I would recommend Latuda to any bipolar client that is dealing stability and a once a day simple administration.,9,49
Latuda,"Worsted my situation, headache, difficulties to talk, suicidal, lethargic, SLOW and lost contact with reality. Worst drug I've ever took.",1,22
Latuda,"Therapist thinks I have bipolar II. I was taking cymbalta, trazadone and klonopin. I am now only on 40mg of Latuda and klonopin. I feel like a zombie. I have no desire to speak when I'm with friends. I've found myself drooling sometimes, letting a small amount of drool drip out. Very embarrassing. I often find myself staring out into nothing. I have trouble keeping still most days. I have to take it with food or I will become very nauseous. Also I must take it before bed because it makes me drowsy. I don't like this medication. I used to be more full of life even if I was depressed under the surface. Now I'm just a bump on a log with nothing to say. Makes me sad about this.",3,47
Latuda,"Worked great for my 13 year old w schizoaffective disorder for 8 months, the only side effect was vomiting a few min after taking it at times. Zantac seemed to help for a while, but the vomiting became more frequent so ultimately he had to come off of it. It seemed to work well though with no restlessness, akasthesia, or any other side effects. He took it with lithium, so it might have been the combination that was too much for his stomach.",9,17
Latuda,"I am taking 750mg of Lithium and 450mg of amisulpride with 80mg of Latuida. I am reducing my amisulpride by 50mg every week until I eventually come off it. My mum has noticed that my face has become brighter using Latudia. I experience nausea sometimes with Latuda, I need to eat over 350 calories to not have nausea. I can't eat creamy foods with it, otherwise I vomit. I'm hoping I don't go manic and relapse when I fully come off amisulpride.",0,24
Latuda,I have been taking Latuda for two years. I take 10 onenight and 20mg the next night. I have no side effects and the drug works very well. My only complaint is that I feel very blah. Nothing excites me. I think I am taking too much. I am very sensitive to medicine. I am going to try only 10mg every night and see if that helps....otherwise a wonderful drug.,9,47
Latuda,"Latuda has saved my life. I have been on it for two years now and haven't had any bipolar symptoms in that time. I have Type I bipolar and prior to Latuda I had been suffering from severe mixed state, and very suicidal. I was starting to lose hope that I would ever get better. I have had a completely normal life for the past two years. I have had serious stress (huge events!) and have stayed stable through everything. This drug is a miracle. I haven't had any side effects that I can notice - I've got issues with short term memory, but I don't know if that is a function of the bipolar itself or the meds. It's always been an issue. And for me, it isn't crippling, I just lose details.",10,80
Latuda,"I've been on latuda for now almost a year&amp;what a difference it has made in my life! It keeps my mania&amp; depression@ a minimum.  It had also helped me with my irrational fears, O.C.D., &amp; ruminations!  Thanks to latuda I'm back to a lovely creature!",10,65
Latuda,I started on 20 mg of latuda. I now take 80 mg at night after supper. I also take pristiq and lorazapam. I have been good for five Years on it. No bad side effects. I do go to bed and take the meds at the same every day.,10,39
Latuda,"I have been taking latuda for around a year and a half.  The problem is with this medicine is the akathisa, I started with 20 mg, I was prescribed cogentin, it helps, I seem to be good with the 20mg of latuda, I don't want to stop this medication it works good for me, I can't increase my med because of the akathisa, there are other medicines out there . I hope this helps others",0,27
Latuda,"Worst medicine for bipolar I have tried, it made me extremely angry and irritable. I got extreme hot-flashes that got worst during the night, which prevented me from sleeping. It also made me feel more depressed and I actually gained weight on it. The withdrawals weren't that bad but the hot flashes haven't gone away completely. Not a good drug for me personally but I hope it works well for others.",1,31
Latuda,"Didn't do a thing for my depression. After taking it for just 3months , I came down with the movement disorder. I could not stop suckling and moving my tongue! I would make my tongue raw. I could stop only by chewing gum. Even after having been off the it for almost a year, I still have a problem with my tongue movements. It isn't as bad and I can stop myself from doing it most of the time. I would not recommend this drug to anyone. I was on a very low dose. Some people come down with worse movement disorders than I did. Only take this if you are so depressed you may commit suicide. Otherwise, don't do it. Stay with antidepressants and natural remedies. Like NAC, folate etc..",1,25
Latuda,Horrible!!!  wouldnt recommend to anybody,1,6
Latuda,"Suffering from Bipolar I was prescribed Latuda. Over a 1 year period of taking the drug I lost motivation, became depressed, and bordered suicidal. With a lifetime of struggling with mania and anxiety, I've never been suicidal until taking this drug. It's also a tier 3, so it will run your most expensive copay or thousands a month without copays.",2,15
Latuda,"I am 50ish and have had 'issues' since 20ish and never written a review. Diagnosis is 'bi-polar II' (not sure I agree) but, I also have sleep apnea, hypothyroid &amp; seem to have ADD (only H is my non-stop brain).  I have taken Wellbutrin, Prozac, geodon, abilify, seroquel, lamictal, cymbalta, zyprexa, lithium &amp; others all at ridiculously high clinical doses - stopped each one cold turkey w/o issue. Lamictal worked a little at a point - Latuda (80mg) is the ONLY drug that has given me hope of feeling normal (along with ADD &amp; thyroid). Working on the c-pap and hoping Latuda keeps working.  This brain stuff is a lot of guessing &amp; @ 30 yrs in, I was about to give up on ever feeling ok again - this is awesome!  I remember being me &amp; love it ; )",9,59
Latuda,"I have rapid cycling bi-polar. I started with 20mg of Latuda per day for 4 weeks. Tried it in the morning, and felt so tired and groggy that I could barely function at work. So, I tired taking it at night with klonazepam for sleep and it worked perfectly, except for vivid dreams. At 20mg I was finally feeling happy, smiling, talking to everyone, just all around pleasant. Recently I've bumped up to 40mg and am feeling agitated, cranky, reluctant to talk to anyone, the opposite of where I was emotionally on 20mg. I am going to reduce to 20mg again and see if my positive attitude returns. Definitely take with food. Suicidal thoughts eliminated. Good medication over all!",0,40
Latuda,I have been on Latuda 80mg for almost 2 months for bipolar. I can't function. It has made me more depressed than ever and I wasn't even depressed in the first place. All I had was really bad anger. Doctor told me I am bipolar???? I use to be happy and full of energy. Now I can't get out of bed.,1,25
Latuda,"I first started on Latuda at 20 mg two years ago and then my psychiatrist upped it to 80 mg over a month ago. I do not the same irritability and agitation like I had when I was on 60 mg and small things that rubbed me the wrong way before do not have the same affect on me now. I also take Wellbutrin 300 mg and Viibyrd 20 mg in combination with Latuda. All together I now feel more stable than I have since I was 16, and I am now 23.",10,27
Latuda,I am Bipolar II and have been taking Lamictal 200mg for the past year with great success but I started experiencing severe depression after a manic episode. My psych prescribed Latuda about 9 months ago. In the beginning I was on 40 mg and I began to better but my psych thought if 40mg is good 60mg is better. Well that turned me into a zombie. My whole body slowed down. I became extremely claustrophobic like I was going to stop breathing. I had to take it at night with dinner because it knocked me right out. I had my psych reduce my dosage to 40mg then to 20mg. However now that I'm on 20mg I still feel some depression so I don't know if it's worth being on. I do get Latuda for $15 a month using their savings card with my insurance.,6,17
Latuda,Wonder Drug,8,4
Latuda,"I'm 21 years old, and have been diagnosed as major depressive and having generalized anxiety since I was 17. Since then I've been on three different antidepressants from citalopram to Zoloft, and they all had mediocre effects on my depression. It wasn't until I saw a new psychiatrist and had a new diagnosis of bipolar l that I started to experience genuine relief. I attribute most of my recovery to Latuda. In the first weeks of taking this medicine I experienced terrible akathisia (the feeling of tickles or ants in your body) which kept me up at night, but after a few weeks I was told to take it with my trazadone (my sleeping pill) at night and the sensation went away. It was probably only a few weeks when I began to feel normal.",10,38
Latuda,"Currently take 80mg once a day for bipolar II.  Take with food at night, otherwise feel nauseous. Used to be terrified of going out in public (grocery store) and now I no longer feel anxious going shopping by myself.  Had extreme road rage, everyone around me made me angry.  I have no road rage at all now, even with LA traffic.  I can go dancing with my friends and be completely sober, when before I'd have to have a few drinks before I'd even think about stepping out on the dance floor.  Latuda has really changed my life I am more social, less irritable, and just a better person to be around.",10,76
Latuda,"Before I was prescribed latuda, I was at the end of my rope. I was SO depressed. My doctor put me on 20 mg and overnight everything was beautiful again. I enjoyed doing things I hadn't in years. The latuda would put me right to sleep and I had vivid dreams. 2 months later, all those good feelings were gone. My doctor bumped me up to 40mg but I only experienced horrible side effects like agitation and anxiety. I'm back at 20mg and I want off it completely. I can't eat or sleep. I have to take xanax to fall asleep now and I feel myself slipping back into depression. I should also mention that whenever I have a drink, I automatically black out so I can't even have a few drinks with my friends anymore.",4,39
Latuda,"Started this medication for bipolar depression. At first it worked wonderfully. I was happier, open and energetic but after 2 months I started to feel more and more anxious. The anxiety took over my life. I was terrified and I became a total basket case.  I stopped taking latuda and I returned to normal. If I hadn't of stopped when I did the latuda would have ruined my life. I will never touch this drug again.",1,38
Latuda,"Worked extremely well when I first started it at 20mg- I felt amazing good, started listening to music , became more affectionate and loving with friends and family , I was feeling so good that I started telling people out of the blue that I feel happy for first time in my life. BUT, that didn't last for very long. Over the next 4-5 weeks it completely stopped working and my old depressive symptoms of my bipolar disease came back. My doc upped the dosage to 40mg to see if I could get back to the old positive state I had before at the beginning but no dice . The higher 40mg dose gave me horrible severe anxiousness, agitation , and restlessness. Others have referred to this state of agitation as akathisia. I was climbing the walls!",3,42
Latuda,"I cannot express how much better I feel and am after trying Latuda. I'm on the lowest dosage, and I felt the effects within the first few days of taking the 20mg. It has been life changing medication but extremely cost prohibitive. I wish that it wasn't so expensive since it works so well. I used to be irritable, angry and unpredictable--occasionally reclusive and had big manic upswings of extreme activity. I had a hard time being affectionate and open emotionally. Latuda has changed my life. I want to touch my husband, hug my kids and I am not annoyed by everything and everyone around me. I take Clonazepam (Klonopin) with it at night and have not had trouble sleeping at all.",10,47
Latuda,Good Experience overall. More motivated less depressed and no side effects. I take 30mg. You have to take it with food otherwise you'd get nausea.,8,28
Latuda,"I don't want to bash this drug because it sounds like it is really good for a lot of people. Also, it is by far the best antipsychotic I have tried in terms of side effects and effectiveness. However, like all antipsychotics I've tried so far (Seroquel, Abilify), it made me emotionally flat and unable to enjoy life. Being on it is better then being depressed, but it took away my ability to enjoy everything I used to (reading a good book, listening to music, looking beautiful scenery or paintings). I am switching over to Depakote, and I can already feel my life coming back as the Latuda goes down.",6,36
Latuda,"I was looking forward to trying Latuda however in the month that I took it, the side effects were too much for me.  I could not sleep, I was restless,  irritable, argumentative - basically not pleasant to be around.  And it made my muscles ache so bad I could hardly walk.  It wasn't for me.  Good luck!",2,26
Latuda,I have rapid cycling bipolar disorder.I was starting latuda because I wanted to get pregnant and it was suggested by my psychiatrist. While I was on it my moods were rapidly cycling worse than I was when off meds. I had 4 attempts at suicide before the doctor suggested going back to lithium.,4,21
Latuda,"I took Latuda for my recently diagnosed bipolar II. I started on 20mg and it was great for my mood. It did have a strange side effect of making me incredibly anxious to go to bed. I physically had to go to sleep at the same time every day or I would be jittery, irritable, and anxious the whole time I stayed up. My doctor thought going up in dosage could reduce this and help my mood more, but it just made the akthasia worse, leaving me with shaky hands and a clenching jaw as well. I wish this drug didn't have the physical side effects, because during the day I felt great!",7,29
Latuda,"I started latuda 11 months ago (20mg, then 40, now 60), and I think all it does is trigger hypomanic episodes with dose increases and when those end I end up feeling more depressed than ever. The depressive episodes on latuda have been some of my worst in over three years, and the hypomanic episodes seem to last longer than usual. I also get ridiculously restless, having trouble falling asleep, but then having trouble waking up (I sleep through alarms for over an hour). I thought I found the drug for me, but I'll be seeing my psychiatrist soon to switch. At least it worked well for awhile?",4,19
Latuda,"I have some kind of Depressive Disorder-- Never have had a diagnosis done but I ruminate a lot. I also suffered a manic episode a few months ago which served to make me feel more trapped and hopeless than ever. I started Latuda about 6 weeks ago at 20 mg. My psych was confident about this medication. Three weeks into the treatment I began to feel way less depressed. I was socializing more, and I wouldn't get stuck in my thoughts. It was wonderful. Unfortunately it lasted only for a few days and the depression came back. I continued to work with my doctor and we increased the dosage from 40 to 60 to 80. Right now, I am tapering off of it and feeling more miserable and incapacitated than I have in my entire life. It's horrible. I feel like I don't know what to do with myself. The voice in my head is relentless. This medication made me worse, and my psych and I had very high hopes for it. I couldn't sleep on it as well. I wanted to stick it out to see if a higher does would work for me but decided that the depression I'm experiencing now is much too intense to push on through. I'm going to see her ASAP after the holidays and ask to be put on Lactimal. Maybe this will work for you, but it was not my niche. I'm giving it a two only because I experienced no side effects aside from the insomnia, and Seroquel took care of that.",2,27
Latuda,"I've been taking latuda 40mg for almost 2 weeks. I was feeling less depressed, my mood had stabilized but I felt a lot of anxiety, more than before I started the medicine. Looking back and thinking about where I am today, irritable, angry and feeling confused. I may be having a manic episode that the medicine may have induced.",3,19
Latuda,I tried for six months and would always wake up after only 3 hours. I was great for 4 or 5 days and then would sink into deep depression and threaten family with suicide for about 2 days. . Could never get sleep under control. Made my mood swings more dramatic. Have stopped and gone back to geodon. Just have to put more effort in personally to make myself better to get past serious depression.,4,20
Latuda,"I was deeply suicidal for 15 years with repetitive suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. I was at the end of my rope close to killing myself and my doctor suggested latuda. I started at 80 mg 1x a day at bed time. Suicidal thoughts and constant thoughts of my 15 year old cat constantly dying largely diminished. I have a down episode once every 6 days about where I am hopeless and negative thinking again, but that lasts only a day or two. I am not missing work any more and have no problem waking up. I can only sleep 3 hours a night though after 3 months and my doctor upped me to 120 mg. Bad decision still sleepless. Going to try to go down to 40mg to help sleep will report back with results. Xanax and unisom help sleep. Well after 6 months on",9,34
Latuda,"I started taking Latuda on the 20 mg. starter dose and am now up to 40 mg. at night.  I also take 1200 mg. per day of Lithium.  I started taking Latuda because the Lithium was not quite controlling the hypomanic break-through events.  The Latuda is amazing.  I started noticing the change about 3 days into it.  The main thing is that I feel calm, the best I have felt in about 20 years.  It does not make me that sleepy, although I used to have trouble falling asleep, and now it is no problem.  It does make me hungry, which I have to fight all day.  I will take hungry over feeling like crap any day.",10,44
Latuda,I am bi polar 1 and I take 80 mg of Latuda and 150 mg of Lamictal. I feel wonderful. I've been healthy and stable for 8 1/2 months.,10,38
Latuda,"Before I took latuda, my bipolar disorder was pretty much ruining my life. I started latuda and about 2 months later, while I was starting to feel so much better. I also noticed that I was starting to feel overwhelmed and was starting to become delusional and developed irrational fears such as being scared to even go outside for example. I stopped latuda and went back to feeling normal. I thought it might have just been me and my bipolar was starting to have a severe effect on my life again so just a few months ago I decided to try latuda again. And within a week I was starting to feel overwhelmed and delusional again. I will never take it again. While the medication was effective, the side effects were horrific.",1,32
Latuda,"I recently sought help from a psychiatrist and he prescribed me starter doses of Lamictal. He also gave me samples of Latuda for if I began to notice myself experiencing an episode. I noticed that I began to have a quick decline in to depression after a hypomanic state and reluctantly began to take the Latuda. It is AMAZING. After only 5 days of use, I already feel so much better.  Today  I just noticed that I am not depressed anymore, as I was a few days ago. I am able to take better care of my body (eating better, exercise) because I already am feeling so much better. I get very sleepy and some akathisia, I just take it at night to avoid those side effects.",10,35
Latuda,"I went through a traumatizing story but, I rather just tell you the thoughts on lutuda. Unfortunately, I'm on it due to suicidal thoughts according to these amazing doctors  (being sarcastic!). I wasn't suicidal the least. But, I've been on this medication for over a month I'm taking lutuda at 80 mg and cymbalta at 30mg. Latuda is working for depression but, I still cry everyday because of my experience which was horrible.. I'm taking cymbalta for chronic pain and its helping, I rather take only cymbalta I don't feel safe with latuda I honestly do believe latuda is for personality disorder and I don't even have that.. But, the doctors keep giving me drugs I do not need to stabilize me.  I want to get off asap",6,14
Latuda,"I have been on Latuda for over two years. I feel a lot better,  though I am somewhat apathetic and don't want to bathe, cook, or clean house. I have to eat a large meal to stave off the nausea. When I have nausea,  I eat saltine crackers until I no longer feel sick. Other types of crackers work too. I take benztropine to prevent unconscious chewing. It doesn't stop the fidgeting and restlessness that I feel.",8,20
Latuda,Been on latuda for 6 weeks and seen no  improvement with my depression. Still have suicidal thoughts and zero energy.,1,15
Latuda,"This medication saved my life. I was so numb from bipolar depression that I literally lost all feelings; I did not have pleasure in anything, was not upset by anything, was not angry and basically had no personality. After two weeks on this, I got significantly better. Of course, I needed other meds, and finding those was difficult. This was the pillar medicine after which everything else became add on's. I was recently in Australia, and they don't have Latuda there, so I don't think I could live there! I've been hoping for the day when I can finally give a med a perfect score (because when I was sick all I did was dream of getting myself back), and now I can. Alleviates bipolar depression and any residual psychotic symptoms.",10,37
Latuda,I have been severely suicidal for 15 years with no attempts in that time. Just could not escape the repetitive desire to escape my bad depression. Started taking Latuda 4 months ago 80mg and suicidal thoughts have diminished greatly. Problem sleeping now and some twitching doc put me up to 120mg and sleeping only 3 hours a night usually. I am 250 pounds and was 290 before bipolar medicine. Food cravings have pretty much ceased. Amazing thing is even with little sleep I am not having nearly as many haywire thoughts from my schizophrenia as I usually do without much sleep. Actually want to try now. I am back down to 80 mg and think I am going to halve that to 40mg in a week to get sleep back under control. Xanax and unisom are helping for sleep now,7,14
Latuda,"I had been on Latudia 2 yrs with excellent results I feel it saved my life. But, due to being on Medicare now the cost is not covered. I am now on the roller coaster trying to find the right fit for my Bipolar. This is very depressing.",10,21
Latuda,"I have been on Latuda for a little over a year now. It's been extremely helpful for both mania and depression. I had psychotic mixed episodes, which Lithium did not help. On Latuda, I feel stable and like myself. However, I have mild akathisia, meaning I don't twitch, but I feel horrible if I take it during the day. I take it at night before bed with Lorazepam as needed, (I am probably going to switch to a more regular sleep med soon) and that pretty much solved the problem. The only issue is that it is expensive, but thankfully I have insurance that covers it after my deductible.",9,25
Latuda,"I recently started this medication after issues with my previous meds that lasted two and a hhalf years. Major improvements! I enjoy the clarity, the increase in motiviation (for finishing tasks and social experiences) and lack of 'fog' that used to cloud my mind. I'm a big guy, so I started on 80mg: which was way too strong. But after cutting the dose in half, I am actually looking and feeling better than I have for years; my therapist, psychiatrist, family and friends all notice an extremely postive difference and vocalize this almost every day :)  Taking it with dinner, though, seems to cause my mental and physical energy to dissipate rapidly. I go to bed much earlier than I'd like to, though.",8,36
Latuda,"I have been dealing with mental health issues since I was about 19yr.s old and am 45 now. I have been on numerous medication, too many to count and I started taking latuda about 3 weeks ago. I also take trileptal, lamictal, litium, and prozac, and vyvance, and I can't begin to tell u how much better I feel. It just amazes me. I haven't snapped at anyone in a couple of weeks, my mood is the most stable its been in 20yrs. I actually like to be around people again. I'm not full of hate and anger. I have dealt with some serious nausea, vomiting, and headaches so it is very important to eat at least the recommended amount of calories, and its much better if I take it at night. I am very grateful I was willing to try latuda. Thank u.",10,29
Latuda,"I wrote a few days ago on 11/13/15. I finally started feeling an increase in my mood over the weekend! It is still very early on, and I am only on Latuda 40mg, but this has left me feeling very optimistic! I got out of bed a little easier today, and when I got to work I had lots of energy. One of my friends texted me and I actually felt excited to text him back (most of my friends know that I'm hard to get a hold of since I've been so isolating). It's still early in the morning as I write this, and my depression tends to get worse toward the end of the work day since I don't know exactly what I will do with myself once I get home for the day, but I am feeling better and I can only hope things continue in this direction!",8,41
Latuda,"I'm on day 6, @20 mg.  I've been waiting for this feeling for a long time.  I have energy, no brain fog, I don't feel like isolating myself, most of all I feel happy.  I'm having weird dreams but I can take that.  I'm not sitting on my assets for days without showering bc it was so laboring just to think much less move.  I don't ache in the way I have been for nearly 8 years.  I also feel like there's an open communication between my brain &amp; body now...before  I had great ideas of things to do but my body wasn't receiving the message.  I can think and remember things now. I got to a point where my head was so tired I had to keep my eyes closed and it's gone now.  This is going to change my life...that's amazing.  I can't wait!",10,46
Latuda,"I take 20 mg of latuda in the am with 450 mg of wellbutrin and at night I take 60mg of latuda with 150mg trazadone, 60 mg of inderal and 1 mg of clondine per day as needed. Latuda has changed my life no more racing thoughts. No more bugging out in public or on people . Just have to eat with food because it does make me nauseous. I recommend this for young adults who are manic or have a personality disorder.",10,28
Latuda,"The first time I took Latuda was in the hospital and I was put on 40 mg. I had a little nausea, but no other side effects. Later my psychiatrist raised the dose to 80 mg. That's when I started having severe akathisia and vomiting (no weight gain or loss though). It seemed almost intolerable, but I stuck with it for several months. I then switched to Abilify but soon was taken off antipsychotics all together. I was stable for several months, but then started having mania again. Recently, my psychiatrist recommended that I try Latuda at a smaller dose. I was skeptical, but I decided to try it. I love it! The dose is just enough to control my symptoms, and I've had no side effects. My new insurance is denying it though, so I'm on samples.",9,39
Latuda,sever headaches and nausea.  Awaiting the phone call from my doctor to get me off it!,1,13
Latuda,"Latuda has been a lifesaver. I've been battling crippling depression, suicide attempts and extreme mania. I have been through it all, tons of money and success to literally living out of a van. Latuda has completely equalized me and has allowed me to live a normal life. Bad akathesia as a side effect but if I take it at night I'm ok. Make sure to take this drug with food, that's vital!  Give it a try it may save your life :)",10,43
Latuda,"I started taking Latuda in 2014 after I went off Lithium, and Lamotgrine just wasn't helping my depression side. Right away I noticed a difference. I think ever since my life has been doing well. I'm doing well in my professional life. I think of suicide very little now. I still have my ups and downs at times though, and I think a lot of it has to do with not eating right and exercising. When I do those things and take Latuda I feel great. Only thing I don't like about Latuda is if you don't take with enough food (vegetables not enough, you need something starchy at least 350 calories) you vomit or feel really sick. It feels like something foreign in your body. And it also makes me soooo tired! Sometimes I actually feel a little scared.",0,32
Latuda,"For mixed mania sufferers. This medication did a wonderful job killing a severe mixed mania that I had last winter. Most symptoms vanished within a week, though some persisted for a little over a month. But this was on the minimal dose. Now for depression; it didn't exactly work wonders at all. In fact, I don't think it did anything. But again, a low dose at that point was 40 mg. But yes, take this for mixed episodes. It can really help!",8,14
Latuda,My mother has been on this medication for about 3 months.  We have seen improvements.  However now the issue is she can't afford it. In Sept the portion she had to pay was $95.00  (high but do able) and in Oct she will have to pay $383.00.  what the heck...And she doesn't qualify for any of the coupon program out there....No in the process of trying to get her doctor to prescribe something cheaper.,0,19
Latuda,After over a period of 17 years and trying a crazy amount of other drugs I'm happy to report I feel better then I have in 25 years. It's been a struggle. I'm no longer suicidal which is a miracle. I feel good but not flat. No side effects. Anyway good stuff. Perfect for me.,10,36
Latuda,It made very aggressive that the police had to come to my house I don't recommend if your under 18,1,16
Latuda,"I have been suffering with depression,anxiety and suicidal thinking since age 13. I'm now 27 and have been on many different meds. Nothing has ever worked for me until I got prescribed latuda. There are a few side effects like nausea and headaches but that's nothing compared to how I felt before. I take 40mg daily and recommend it to anyone who is bipolar or depressed. It  REALLY works for me. I can actually live a happy and fulfilling life now. Good luck to all of you. Stay happy :-)",9,40
Latuda,"Took it for three days on third day had a breakdown while driving the medication made me very nervous and it ended with me having a severe anxiety attack, stopped taking it anxiety went away",1,17
Latuda,"Wonderful drug if you are bipolar and type A personality, lots of energy and almost no side effects , I have to work out or run almost everyday and have a healthy diet if not the drug is too much to handle for me",10,32
Latuda,I love latuda! After being prescribed countless different meds for my bipolar I can say latuda has been a life changer. I'm less manic my highs and lows feel pretty stable. I've only been on 40mg going on 3wks. I do make sure to take with at least 350 calories.,9,18
Latuda,Lauda has been a life saver for me. I am bi polar 1 with rapid cycling. I've been on this drug for about six months and I am happy and stable. The two things I recommend though are take it at night and take it with a meal. The first few months it made me so sleepy but that eventually wore off. Good luck!,10,39
Latuda,"I have been battling bipolar the majority of my life. At one point I was on 8 different medications: lamictal, depakote, seroquel, elavil, neurontin, propranolol, a couple I can't think of.  My most recent doctor got me down to 3, the main one being Lithium. I began Latuda on 20mg for a week and now I'm on my 4th day at 40mg. Today is my second day with adverse side effects...extreme nausea, loss of appetite and diarrhea.  I trust this will pass as it did the first few weeks with lithium.  I have to say that I'm loving the med otherwise. I'm quicker to smile and slower to anger...I nearly feel in control.  Make sure you take with food and expect to be less than 100% for a couple of weeks.",8,38
Latuda,Recently diagnosed bi polar. I was on Latuda 40mg and felt good. After two weeks of the 80mg that my psychiatrist prescribed me I started to notice severe depression. It would occur about 30 minutes after taking. I was even having suicidal thoughts which has never happened to me. The first night I stopped taking it I did not feel depressed at all. The med just didn't work for me. We are going to try Abilify next.,3,23
Latuda,"For anyone setting on the fence about latuda please give it a try. Its new and has least side effects. After trying geodon, tegretol, abilify and others this past year and one other which suddenly made hair loss which was a side effect plus it really wasn't the best, I tried latuda, first week I felt confused etc. So I stopped taking it less than a week. Iam med sensitive big time, everyone suggested to try again for one month and I did and confused and forgetfulness etc passed in a weeks time and a month no side effects and I began to be my old self finally after two years. I'm happy and feel great. No anxiety or depression now. Very clear and focused and not forgetful. Concentration is great.20mg pm. Cymbalta am 60mg. Hope I helped",10,60
Latuda,"I have been taking this at 20mg for a week and have went from decent to violently ill ...vomiting, the runs, crippling headaches, muscle pain ... I stopped taking it today slowly starting to feel better...",2,16
Latuda,I've only taken latuda for 4 days. I'd been diagnosed with bipolar several times in the last decade but too scared to try other meds. Was on Lexapro which made me feel warm and bundled up but not myself. I don't know how to say this but I'm feeling better than I have for 10 years. I forgot what it was like to be me. Taking it at night because it make me feel sleepy for a few hours. I just do things rather than want to sleep or come up with reasons not to do them. I found myself smiling today without a reason. I'm hoping this positive reaction will continue. If so I can't believe what a great drug this is.,10,55
Latuda,Do not take this medicine without food! I cannot stress this enough! I forgot to take my meds with dinner tonight and remembered several hours later but forgot that I had to eat while taking it. Less than 5 minutes after taking it I became extremely nauseous and had to force myself to not throw up. It causes nausea anyways but this was awful. So Always eat something with this medicine.,0,35
Latuda,"Because Abilify went to generic recently, my therapist could no longer give me samples, so I had to discontinue it and after going a month with only taking my Wellbutrin &amp; Xanax to help treat my Bi-polar disorder, I crashed!! My therapist suggested I try Latuda, but because I have serious side-effects from most drugs, I was hesitant! Finally decided, after reading a lot of reviews on here, to at least try it. I started on 20 mg and after 10 days, the only thing happening was a lot of vivid dreaming!  I was still anxious &amp; very depressed, so I increased my dosage to 40 mg and after 3 days, the depression &amp; anxiety lifted!  No nausea or weight gain, but very sleepy after a couple hours of taking &amp; still lots of crazy dreams!  I'm HAPPY again!",8,50
Latuda,I've been on so many medications since I was 13 I couldn't possibly remember nor list them all. One was abilify. I hated it. It made me extremely tired and fatigued. Latuda is by far the best medication I have ever been on. To bad it is so expensive.,9,33
Latuda,I have had rapid cycling bipolar for years. My depression was always there even when I was at my best. I started taking latuda about 8 months ago and I've been without a major episode for 6 months. I think it's my miracle drug I haven't been this well in over 10 years.,10,50
Latuda,Started taking 20 mg.  Makes me sleepy (like almost knocks me out) and had a headache for a few days. Week 2 Day 2 of upping  dose to 40 mg now sleepy &amp; nauseous.,7,17
Latuda,"After 6 years of different meds that never worked I was put on 20mg of latuda. Didn't do anything, didn't work at all. Doc upped it to 40mg. Taking 40mg gave me maybe 3 weeks of terrible headaches and nausea. Then one morning I woke up and actually felt good, well rested, clear-headed...was such a strange feeling to me. Then I turned on some music and I actually FELT music again, I started dancing around while getting ready. Started reaching out socially, started exercising, and started actually taking a shower every morning again! I can not express in words how good and normal I feel, I actually feel things again. Latuda did a 180 degree change on my life, thanks to the researchers who created this drug, you guys are amazing!",10,87
Latuda,"300 lithium, klonopin, 20 Latuda...I took the latuda for 3 weeks. With in 2 days it made me emotional.. I cried about everything. I thought maybe it was a temporary side effect.. after 3 weeks I quit taking it, I couldn't handle being so emotional. I've been off 4 days and I feel like I have regressed.",1,25
Latuda,I had tried every medication that my doctor gave me for bipolar disorder and none of them worked. Then they put me on latuda. It worked wonderful for me. I was on it for a year and a half. Then I got tired of the tremors. I have been off of it for over 6 months now and I still have the tremors. I'm a diabetic and cause of the tremors I can't tell when my sugar is low. I also can't feel when it is high either. This medication works great for bipolar but the side effects suck.,10,22
Latuda,"I've been on this medicine for 2 months now. They up'd my dosage every week as follows, 20mg, 40mg, 60mg, 60mg went to my check up and I still felt very irritable and mean so she bumped me to 80mg and said that should work. NO! I hated it! I felt like I was jumping out of my skin, I couldn't sit still and felt so antsy that I couldn't sleep. I had to drink a beer or take a Xanax to fall asleep. I decided to take matters in my own hands and dropped myself back down to 40mg and I feel great now. I have no depression and I feel alive again. My anxiety is still here but will be back on my Klonopins soon to help. I HAVE to take this with dinner or I feel nauseous.",9,29
Latuda,"The only med that ever worked for me! Although it has major side effects like confusion, memory loss, and muscle aches. Thanks sunovion for making a wonderful product. Unfortunately  I can't take it right now cause I don't have insurance and 120 milligrams is 1200 bucks for a month.",8,28
Latuda,"Sure, I feel great. But I've gained 20 pounds. I was 125, now I'm nearly 150. I'm a teenager, I don't need this. I don't even know why they put me on this drug in the first place. Not to mention that my hands have been shakey and slow. I'm an artist. This just isn't right for me.",3,33
Latuda,I have been on Latuda 80mg for 10 months now and can honestly say that it has changed my life. The first few weeks of adjusting to the medication was awful - I couldn't work and the nausea and headaches were out of this world. However now I feel as feel as good as new. It has stopped my hallucinations and has kept me balanced. It does make me very sedate after taking it so I only take it right before bedtime.,9,25
Latuda,"It's one of those pills that I dread having to take -- no matter what, without fail, it makes me feel sick to my stomach. It hasn't lessened in the least and sure, it's gone by morning, but in the meantime it's pure hell.",1,18
Latuda,"When I took Latuda, I had terrible back spasms that lasted for hours. I couldn't stop moving and when I sat down I had to rock back and forth for any comfort. I know that maybe it was because I took 120 mg a day but, when I started taking lower doses with cogentin it was just getting worse. I now have been off of it for almost a year and I have never felt better except with the occasional back pain. I know this may not help you but, know that there are always going to be people out there to support you. They gave me this drug at that dose when I was fourteen and I know why. I hope this helps in any way",1,19
Latuda,"After battling insurance to finally cover this med, I can't say the improvements in depression are worth the 1,000 price tag. After trying numerous medications for over 17 years to help with depression, I was really hoping for more. I would say that as an add on to Prozac, it is only somewhat effective. At first I was pleased by the lack of noticeable side effects compared to other antipsychotics. It didn't make me groggy during the day, nor did I experience any muscle twitches. However, at about the third month on 20 mg, I began getting severe akathesia shortly after ingesting. It manifested with inner restlessness (not normal for me), anxiety, and inability to stop moving. For me, this has gotten so unpleasant that I've decided to stop it.",3,29
Latuda,I have taken this med twice in the past few years. Because of ECT I couldn't remember my prior experience but for some reason I was taken off it. I remember now. I experience crippling nausea and irritability. I makes me mean. Also within 15 minutes of taking it I'm so sick I have to lie down. I'm going to ask my psychiatrist to take me off it. I just can't function with so much nausea. :(,5,23
Latuda,This drug is the devil.Its evil! Some drugs are not for everyone and this one is not for me! Be careful.,1,27
Latuda,"I am on 80mg of Latuda, 1050 mg of Lithium, 12.5mg of Ambien CR and can say I feel normal and happy again. I got my life back!",9,28
Latuda,"I have just started Latuda and I am so happy with it (I will update after I've been on it for a while).  I switched from Olanzapine and the difference is incredible. Olanzapine had me feeling groggy and tired. Latuda, from day one, has had my brain feeling clear and I've had my my energy back! My apartment is finally clean and I'm not losing everything all the time (seriously - I lost my phone daily before)  The only side effect is that I am super drowsy when I take it, which has to be with dinner, so the whole night I'm tired. I see this as a positive, because I used to be up all night on olanzapine.  Plus, I wake up in the morning and I'm wide awake! Latuda has been amazing!",9,56
Latuda,"Dr. decided to try Latuda. The side effects completely outweighed the benefits for me. For a while I was able to tolerate the headaches and nausea, and enjoyed the mood improvement. I was actually able to feel true happiness in happy situations. But it also affected my menstrual cycle to where I was experiencing a full week of cramps (not normal for me) and was 2 weeks late (also not normal for me). Then the nausea just became vomiting every time I took the pill. So I stopped it. I really wished it would work because I liked the happiness I experienced and no mania.",2,13
Latuda,"I was on 74mg of Latuda, gained 30lbs overnight and developed tardive dyskinesia. For me the side effects outweighed the therapeutic benefits.",1,22
Latuda,"I was on 20 mg Latuda with 300 mg Lithium. It was the most normal I have felt in a while. For me it has being weight neutral in comparison with Zyprexa. Zyprexa made me gain 5 pounds per day &amp; 80 pounds in a few days. Latuda gave me more energy to work out. Naturally, if I don't take meds I don't even have to work out &amp; have a fast metabolism &amp; loose weight easily. With meds I need to exercise. However, the main difference is that with Zyprexa I would exercise 5 times per week, 2 hours per day, eat healthy &amp; still gain a ton of weight. Latuda helps me maintain healthy weight. Unfortunately, my doctor for some reason decided to increase my Latuda doze to 40 mg. I am now having muscle spasm, around my eyes.",10,31
Latuda,I've been on Latuda for around 8 months now.  I have a Dr appointment next week and I am going to ask to switch to something else or add another med to it.  I am tired all the time.  I can barely stay awake within an hour of taking it.  I am emotionless.  Never feel better than a 5 out of 10.  Don't feel happiness.  No joy in any activities.  It's definitely good at evening you out....too good.  It has not conquered my depression.  I find it hard to focus and it is starting to effect my job.  I just want to feel happy again.,6,27
Latuda,40mg latuda Makes my arms hurt. Makes me feel high like a zombie take it at night only. I been getting a lil snappy towards people. I take trazadone 150 mg at night to sleep. Also take hydroxyzine 25mg as needed for anxiety. Bipolar I diagnose. . I hate meds...,2,20
Latuda,I've been on Latuda for 8 months now. Got off Risperdal which made me zombie like. I am taking 120mg of Latuda and love this medication. It has been successful in treating my depression/irritability. I am also taking Viibryd and Welbutrin. I have experienced NO weight gain. I recommend giving this medication a try if all others fail.,10,45
Latuda,This med did nothing for my Bipolar 1 disorder. It's very expensive if you do not have medical coverage,1,18
Latuda,It did not help at all  and my doctor said there's no weight gain yet there was,0,26
Latuda,"I've been taking Latuda for over a year now for bipolar 2.  It seemed to work well for a few months at 40mg, then stopped working.  Upped dose to 60, worked for a few months.  Increased again to 80, now ineffective.  Now I'm on lamotrigine concurrently - if that helps I will stop taking Latuda. Side effects have been very bad.  Never had a panic attack in my life until I took Latuda, now I've had several.  Nausea every time I take it.  Supposedly this medicine is weight-neutral, but I gained at least 30 pounds over the past year and a half (I didn't change my diet or exercise habits from before taking it).  Now I am eating better and working out, but I doubt if I can lose the weight until I'm off Latuda.  Hope to get off it soon!",3,24
Latuda,"I've been taking 10mg of Latuda for two days now. I take it in the morning with breakfast, so I haven't experienced nausea. However, I do have more difficulty getting up in the morning, but once I'm up, I seem to be more energetic than I have been in ages. Last night I was watching a comedy show on television and laughed so hard for so long it actually scared me. Like it was completely foreign to me to be express that level of happiness/giddiness. On the flip side, I've noticed that I've gained 4 pounds in two days, so that is totally freaking me out. I have always been a little overweight, so the idea of gaining more weight is untenable for me. I will be watching my weight over the next few days and see how it goes.",8,48
Latuda,"I had been on Effoxor XR forever, and it wasn't working like it used to. It just kept me barely sane. I added Latuda 20mg at night, and very quickly I was feeling normal for the first time in years. No more crying depression, no more overly happiness. But a stable feeling. A happy medium. It didn't make me numb or zombie like. I feel productive for the most part. I sleep better and wake more positive. It has triggered my already sweet tooth, and I've gained weight, but I'm just so relieved with my mood, I can handle it...I like it overall.",10,51
Latuda,After taking for a week I felt awesome! My mood improved tremendously!! Then at about two weeks my muscles in my hands stiffened up and they were very restless. It was a horrible feeling so I stopped taking it,5,24
Latuda,Hated it,1,18
Latuda,"Just started 80mg at night with a meal. Was taking Seroquel 400mg at night, gabapentin 4000mg a day and depekote xr. Found a great shrink and was re diagnosed bi-polar I. In the past it was bi polar II.  I never gained weight since I am Type 1 diabetic. Along with 0.5mg klonopin twice a day as needed for panic disorder. Life seems brighter when I wake up. I am on no opoid meds. It seems this new drug doesn't spike glucose levels like most bi polar meds eg. Seroquel.",9,32
Latuda,"I started latuda about 2 weeks ago and am taking the 80 mg So far I have not noticed much change at all. I feel a bit more happy during the day but not much. However, debating on if I should stop taking it due to the horrific side effects I am having. It makes me feel over tired. You know that feeling you get when your to drunk? You wanna go to sleep but your to dizzy and feel like throwing up? It feels like that. Also I become very weak and can hardly pick up anything. I'm hoping these side effects will pass so I can start to understand if it is working for me or not.",5,36
Latuda,"I took Latuda 20mg po qd for 3wk out of 4wk I got Rx for. During the 1st wk , I felt better.  In the 3rd wk,  I increasingly felt weak, drugged and unable to function. My BP remained normal. At no time, did Latuda helped with my chief symptom -sleeplessness.",2,19
Latuda,"I started Latuda (20 mg) about 2 weeks ago and felt improvement almost immediately, like within 24 hours. I was extremely skeptical thinking it was just an anomaly but I have felt good every day since starting it. I am bipolar 1 and was in EXTREME depression and anxiety before starting it. I do not take it with food and have had no nausea. (As a matter of fact I had had more nausea before starting Latuda than after! ) I have been on about 8 other meds and none have worked like this. Just 3 weeks ago I could not even sit at the table for a family dinner. I was so depressed and anxious I would leave almost immediately. Now I feel happy ( yes happy!) and sociable. At first it made me sleepy but that one side effect has left.",10,93
Latuda,"I switched from Seroquel to latuda 5 days ago, INSTANT IMPROVEMENT! My sweet cravings are gone, I can exercise again, I don't feel like a slug at work. I Have only one complaint. The nausea is pretty bad, I've almost thrown up a couple of times, but right now, the pros outweigh the cons, hopefully the nausea will subside after a while. Ill update in a month",9,58
Latuda,After trying to commit suicide my psychiatrist put me on latuda  it has literally saved my life. I'm on 120 mg at night as well as seroquel trazodone pristiq and tegretol. I'm living life again !,10,55
Latuda,"I first started latuda at 40mg and it had zero effect.  My dose was increased to 80mg and within two days, every single last bit of noise in my head disappeared completely.  My focus is excellent now and my life has literally changed because of this drug.  My energy is put into things that are important like a clean house and a clean body and I am so happy all the time now.  I can't believe how excellent this drug is and I am so happy I was given the right dose to help me live a better life.  I'm actually ready to face the world again and get off of disability and go back to work!  I CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW MUCH THIS DRUG HAS CHANGED MY LIFE POSITIVELY.  Complete 180 degree turnaround!",10,126
Latuda,Switched to Latuda after suffering a full manic episode.  Works so much better than Depakote.  No real side effects.  Works very well at helping to control my mood-swings and manic energy.  Everyone including myself cant believe how well it works for me.,10,98
Latuda,"I've always felt  like I live a totally parallel life to everyone around me - Never feeling like I am living a normal life. I was always way up or way down,  never a happy medium. Honestly, it was difficult to keep up the charade of tirelessly trying to hide what everyone but me already knew &amp; accepted - I was bipolar.  I have tried a flurry of medications in conjunction with my current medication, Adderall - as I have always been classic ADHD. The last medication I tried scared me from even trying any new medications as I suffered from some serious SE of Stevens-Johnson Synd. Reluctantly, I tried Latuda &amp; suddenly, my world was righted &amp; I feel normal. I've never felt better in my entire life (aside from the headaches)  I'm reborn baby !",10,57
Latuda,"After 5 months on this medication it did nothing for my manic-depressive bipolar disorder that I was diagnosed with. It caused me to rapidly put on fat and riddled me with anxiety. I've never had a panic attack in my life until I took this medication. I was prescribed latuda 40mg, after 2 months had numerous panic attacks and gained over 15lbs of fat, made me very angry and anti-social, it's also expensive as hell even with insurance. I quit taking it and forced myself to workout and eat clean and I feel 10x better than when I was taking this crap. No more depression, no more panic attacks or anger. My bipolar symptoms are completely gone from just changing my diet and adding structure to my chaotic life.",1,37
Latuda,"I started Latuda about 4 months ago withgradually increases in dosage. This medication has been a wonderful. I have PTSD and bipolar anxiety/depression. I've taken all the usual Meds depikote, Zoloft and many others with weight gain and other side effects more than I can mention. When it comes to latuda though I have had some restlessness but that only comes when I don't eat proper meals with it. Otherwise I find that with Trazadone and lamotrogine I sleep well and my  night terrors are better controlled. I love this medication.",10,48
Latuda,"I've been on Latuda going on two months now and it's just not working. I'm still depressed crying all the time, and have even been violent towards my boyfriend. Also very angry. The side effects are very bad for me since I don't have an appetite. But I was dealing with it. I tried and nothing. Desperately have to try something else.",1,64
Latuda,"I was given Latuda after a psychotic manic episode. Despite the weight neutral claims, I gained 13 pounds. I am now weaning as my episode has cleared, and am moving onto Lamictal. Here is a hint for everyone gaining weight from antipsychotics. They trick your body into being Type 2 Diabetic. This changes how your body responds to eating carbs. Cut the carbs, and you won't gain weight. Eat carbs, you most likely will.",7,56
Latuda,"I was on Latuda, for 23 days for my post traumatic stress disorder, manic attacks, etc.  At first it seemed to be working.  By day 19, I began having uncontrollable muscle shaking. The last day I took it, my throat started closing up. My tongue was stuck to the roof of my mouth.  Luckily, I had some Xanax.  Otherwise I'd been in the ER. I couldn't sleep, think clearly, or simply sit still. I'm sure for some people this medication is helpful.  It scared me, cause I was having problems swallowing, and breathing.",2,83
Latuda,"I've been taking Lamictal as a mood stabilizer and a foundation to treat my depression. Found it was insufficient on its own so doctor started me on 40mg of Latuda. It worked very well but I just felt ok and it was quite expensive. Tried to switch to Abilify but the restlessness was intolerable and the therapeutic effect wasn't nearly as palpable. Switched back to Latuda at 60mg and don't think I'll ever look back. Tried Zoloft, Celexa, Wellbutrin, Pristiq, Effexor, and Cymbalta also.",9,112
Latuda,"I've been in lamictal and Wellbutrin for over 2 years without a lift on severe bipolar depression. It felt like they kept me just from the edge of suicide but in dark misery.  We started trying atypical antipsychotics...abilify helped a bit with 8 lbs weight gain, saphris lowered anxiety and weight but left depression untouched then came latuda and life changed at 40 mg. The dark cloud lifted in three weeks and I saw and thought and felt clearly. I'm envious that people feel this way all the time and don't appreciate it all. I'm finally living and not just surviving.  Small prices to pay are sleepiness and having to eat so much to take the pills, because it knocks me out I eat later than I'd like and have noticed weight gain.",10,38
Latuda,"I've only been on Latuda 20mg for 2 weeks for bipolar depression. I'm sure my doc will increase my dosage at my next appt this week, but I definitely felt better after a few days at 20mg. Not great, but better than I have in a long time. Kind of a strange feeling to feel a little better after feeling suicidal and depressed for years. I still take clonazepam for my severe anxiety, but I feel latuda can ease my anxiety and depersonalization more with an increase. At first, latuda knocked me out and I slept like a baby. I have trouble sleeping, so this was a nice side effect for me.  Now, after almost two weeks at 20mg, this side effect has subdided. Bummer. So far that's the only side effect I've had. No akathisia for now, thank goodness.",7,26
Latuda,"When I was first prescribed it, it was pretty nice. It stabilized my mood and turned off the static in my head, and could think way clearer. My family commented on how much I was more like myself again. However, over time, I think it lost its effectiveness and eventually suffered a bout of akathesia. I switched to Geodon, which I find better than Latuda.",5,48
Latuda,Have been on Latuda (80 mg) for 3 months and it has done wonders for me.  I am primarily manic and Latuda has helped me greatly.  Much better than Seroquel and a whole bunch of others. Some mild nausea but if I take it with the 350 calories required this equates to no nausea.  still suffer from elevated anxiety but that's another issue.,10,72
Latuda,Started this med a week ago today. It has been the only thing that keeps my moods in line and in check. I am on 60mg of it along with 100mg of Wellbutrin. I have never felt this calm and feel as though I can get thru a day now without constantly mood flipping. The only thing I do not like is that it makes me restless and feel like I constantly need to move around.,9,17
Latuda,Been on Latuda for 2 months and for the first time in years I feel happy and content plus I'm not flip flopping between mad confusion to hyperactive depression anymore.  It gives me that second to think before I react and that has been all the time I need to see where I could go down the angry paranoid path or CHOOSE to take another route.  My anxiety is almost gone with or without benzo's. I smile and have a positive outlook on things now.  The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is as of now it creates a very uncomfortable energy almost like I can't keep still.  So worth it to me I can deal with that.  I have been on all the anti crazy and bat shit loony meds out there and this so far has been the best.,8,159
Latuda,"I was a big time researcher of Latuda before, so I thought I'd add my two cents. Latuda is the only antipsychotic that ever worked for me. I was so depressed that I was in pain and the other atypicals didn't do anything but make me feel like a weird zombie with other movement side effects. Latuda works. I have to be on 3 other meds, but this is the backbone of my treatment. Finally they developed what has been a true miracle antipsychotic for me. I cannot say anything less than it saved my life.",10,115
Latuda,"Diagnosed 20  years ago with bipolar 1.  Struggled for years to try and manage depression with Paxil and anti anxiety meds.  The ups and downs were absolutely wearing me out!  Finally, Latuda was advised by my therapist for my psych to prescribe.  8 days in and I feel almost normal!  I say almost since there is that little uncertainty with any new medicine that it will have staying power.  So far, so good!",8,75
Latuda,I have been telling everyone I trust that this is the best medicine I have ever taken! I have tried everything! I mean everything! I only have a little weight gain and that's it. I'm not tired or exhausted. My crashes are like 5 seconds! Seriously! I'm 44 years old I'm a leisure Body Builder and I'm in shape. I've always been in tune with my body. I always feel if I have a cold coming on and I would fight it before it becomes full blown. I know if I'm getting side effects from medicine which I always have from the other medicines. Latuda does not mess with me sexually either. I recommend this medicine!,10,90
Latuda,"I have struggled with the depression part of Bi-Polar well, forever. I am 34 finally, I can tell that this medication is not only helping with the bi-polar part but I actually feel GOOD! This medicine is a God send for me. I cannot testify to weight gain or side effects just yet because I have only been taking the medication for about 4 months, HOWEVER, I can say that when I take it at night, I have the most horrific nightmares every night.  I am going to try taking in the morning, but I hear it may be a sedative.  I do have a history of sleep paralysis but this is a guarantee nightmare for me.  A sleep aid like Clonazepam sometimes helps... but it is a gamble. I also take  250mg Lamictal a day and 50mg Pristiq a day.",8,41
Latuda,"I've been taking Latuda for about half a year already. It has stopped the voices, and visual hallucinations for a little while. But then they come back after awhile, I'm on the highest dose right now 160mg and I have had less frequent hallucinations but they are still there. I am currently taking it with 5mg of Zyprexa. I also have noticed a notable amount of weight gain, I went from 130lbs to 170lbs. I'm also on 5 other medications, so it's hard to target which is causing the weight gain. I'm also concerned about my blood sugar and the possibility of getting diabetes.",8,40
Latuda,"I'm diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic features. When I first started this medication about 8 months ago, I would get extremely tired soon after I took it, also nauseous. I have to take it at night. The tiredness put me in a low mood but not depressed. After steadily taking it, my doctor put me on a stimulant and that cancels out the tiredness. Honestly I'm so happy at this point in time and I've come so far. I have a job now and a 4.5 GPA and I volunteer. It really has changed my life. I also lost almost 40 pounds and I feel healthier and love life. If you take this medicine everyday and stick to it, it really works. If I skip I definitely feel very agitated and paranoid and angry. I take 40mg a night, sometimes I do still get nauseous.",9,84
Latuda,"It's ok, I'm not suicidal anymore because of Latuda. Not too long ago I got off of Pristiq and Lamictal even tried getting off of Vyvanse, everything went downhill from there, so my psych doc decided to put me on Latuda. At first I felt restless at bedtime but now I feel super tired and sluggish, zombie like.  Also emotionless so I don't know if I will keep taking it. I want to feel again. Right now I've not been feeling like myself. So we will see what the doctor says.",7,36
Latuda,"Latuda changed my life. I feel normal. I'm 48 years old and have been on many, many different types of meds for Bipolar type 1. I was diagnosed when I was 28, and have had quite a roller coaster time until I was put on Latuda 80 mg as well as Wellbutrin XL 300. I also had to add Trazodone 100mg later for sleeping. It's been 3 1/2 years now and I'm married now and taking care of both of my daughters, my grandson, and my husband. It truly has changed my life to stable and normal.",10,69
Latuda,I have been on so many medications that have not worked until I was prescribed Latuda. Everything changed. I feel normal now. It's the best medication for bipolar that I have ever encountered.,10,79
Latuda,"From day one, my mood immediately improved. I felt happier and more energized and started enjoying life again. The problem I have with this medication, however, is that about an hour or two after taking, I am overcome with extreme exhaustion and have to sleep immediately. I can afford this thanks to the discount card, making it around $30 a month.",8,77
Latuda,"I was suicidal and depressed for months. Feels like years. I'm on Wellbutrin as well but have been for years with no improvement. Latuda at 40 mgs has changed my life in 3 weeks. I'm not manic. I'm just normal and happy. High stress situations don't make me spiral, setbacks aren't out of proportion and damn if I'm not in awe that people live like this naturally and take it for granted.",10,162
Latuda,"Thanks to Latuda, I have my life back! I've taken so many medications in the past with no relief of my symptoms until Latuda! I wish I had known about Latuda years ago.",10,55
Latuda,"I have Bipolar depression, schizo effective disorder and PTSD with lots of anxiety. I have been on probably all of the antipsychotics and Latuda is the best so far. I take Klonopin and Viibryd as well.  I also have diabetes which makes it hard to find the right medication as most antipsychotics raise your sugar. Latuda has not raised my sugar. I have even lost 20 lbs. The only thing I don't like about Latuda is it makes me feel weak. I have been on for 6 months now. I have no appetite most of the time which in turn makes my sugar drop to low. I do feel more normal on this but I wish there was something even better. I have the card to get Latuda for only 25.00 if you have insurance.",8,41
Latuda,"It's been a love, hate relationship with Latuda for me. After 2 months of using it, I noticed a significant change in my depression, which was fantastic. But, I experience SEVERE nausea even when I eat enough food. I have even thrown up about 6 or 7 times within my 7 months of taking it. Which is unpleasant to say the least. The nausea usually sets in about 30-45 minutes after taking and lasts anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour.",5,102
Latuda,"I took this, started at 60 mg. Caused severe restlessness and lack of sleep. Felt like I had tachycardia going on but didn't. switched down to 30 mg without doctors consent and don't get restless or have the feeling in my chest as bad. It's been a little over a week wish I had better idea on if it's working or not.",5,52
Latuda,I was on Latuda for 3 weeks and it was horrible. Where to begin. From day 2 I was unable to sleep at all. I averaged 2 hours of sleep for 3 weeks straight! Fortunately my Bipolar 1 and Schizoaffective Disorder were held in check. I don't know how. My sleep has now come back due to 100mg of Seroquel. Albeit I can not fall asleep without it. The worst lingering side effect has been with my tongue. It is constantly pushed up against the roof of my mouth! It never ends. I also constantly grind and clench my teeth. This has been the worst experience with any medication I have been on. I am also on 900mg of Lithium and 300mg of Lamictal.,1,50
Latuda,First medicine in years that has seemed to help depression without causing mania.,10,79
Latuda,I've been on Latuda for about 6 weeks for Bipolar depression. It is one of the most effective medications that I have taken for depression but I'm dealing with a few side effects that I hope will go away. I have the paradox of extreme tiredness followed by difficulty sleeping. If I take it during the day I will have a few hours of fighting falling asleep. When I take it at night (which is what I do now) after the initial sleepiness wears off I wake up several times and am somewhat restless. Hopefully I will be able to adjust better over time. If you need something that works fast for depression I would recommend.,7,86
Latuda,"This medication has been helping me since day 1. I had to work through my own set of side effects, of course, but with the help of my doctor and 20mg / night of Latuda, I am well on my way towards a more stable life. I was very leery about taking the step to be on medication again, what with all the trials and errors, as well as misdiagnoses of my past. After barely even 3 weeks of taking Latuda, I feel almost proud of myself for taking this step. I am able to function again with a healthy routine.",8,118
Latuda,"It has been great, but I am to relaxed and have not much desire to do things but when I need to do things it's not a problem, in fact my work has been much faster than it has been in years. I am more focused and content. The unusual effects have been it has stopped my hypoglycemia, caffeine has no effect on me any longer and I have no withdrawals at all when stopped cold.",9,78
Latuda,"Latuda is a miracle for me. I started on 40mg at bedtime then moved up to 80 mg at bedtime. 80 mg was too much as I started having inner restlessness so with my doctors approval I went back to 40 mg.  At 40 mg everything is perfect.  My depression lifted, my compulsive thoughts went away and I can think again.",10,105
Latuda,Amazing medicine. I tried almost everything with no results.  I felt hopeless and wanted to die until Latuda. It has made a great difference in my life in less that 3 weeks.  I now feel again....amazing!  Only draw back is the cost if you do not have insurance but thankfully I do.,9,92
Latuda,Amazing medicine!  My doctor finally took me of Seroquel and put me on an upped dose of Latuda making my dosage 160 mg instead of 80 mg. I feel great and never better. I've lost 20 lbs in a month! Now I'm stuck at this weight but I did lose most of the weight I gained before.  It definitely makes me sleepy but I've heard this goes away soon as your body adjusts.  As for the nausea I've found eating small amount before and larger portion after taking the medicine and following it with a ginger pill and milk helps to stop it.,9,97
Latuda,"Although I am totally stable on this medication, feel great in fact, I have gained weight (40 pounds to be exact).  I take 40 Mg, for about two months now.  I'd give it a 10 but for the weight gain (never been overweight in my life!) which is driving me crazy, especially since my appetite is way down.  My dr is adding Wellbutrin to it.  I am bipolar II.  Been on almost everything else, bad side effects, especially on Abilify.  Good luck. I had hoped to lose weight, but it looks like I'm predisposed to weight gain.",7,73
Latuda,"I've had a horrible experience on this medicine. It makes me really irritable, even more depressed and anxious.",1,74
Latuda,"I've been taking Latuda for about 2 months now. I enjoy life again, everyday I wake up feeling better than before. The intensity of feelings is amazing, I feel alive for the first time. No bad side effects as of now",9,149
Latuda,I rook risperidone for approximately 1 year for bipolar and although I liked the way it made me feel it increased my hunger and I felt more out of control with my eating. I switched to Latuda and noticed my hunger level went from a 8 to about a 2. I felt more in control of my food intake. Although I still felt hungry it wasn't a strong uncontrollable feeling of the need to eat. I recommend this to someone who likes risperidone but has less need for increased appetite. I am glad they approved this medicine for bipolar disorder.,9,95
Latuda,"Am currently on a low dose of Latuda (20 mg), experiencing very bad nausea and irregular bowel. Hopefully I will adapt soon.",10,66
Latuda,"I was diagnosed five years ago as being bipolar and long term Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I have taken many medicines.  I felt so much better when adding Latuda that I went from 80 mg to 120 mg. I totally crashed. I was extremely depressed. I went off the medicine for six weeks. I started again taking 80 mg. I have been stable for five weeks. I also take lithium, Xanax, and Klonopin.  I stay on a strict schedule of exercise.  I am taking it day by day.  This is one of my most expensive medicines.",7,72
Latuda,I took Latuda yesterday for the first time. I took it around 5 pm. I couldn't sleep well during the night but that was probably just getting used to the medicine. Went for a walk for exercise felt great. Felt pleasure again. Felt joy and happiness and love.,10,95
Latuda,"I'm a female in my 60's.  I have been on various anti-depressant medications for about ten years. Nothing has helped much. I finally gave up on them all.        My diagnoses: Depression &amp; post traumatic stress disorder. For the last 2 weeks I've been on 20mg of Latuda. What a positive experience!  It definitely helps me focus better. And helps decrease my depression.  The only complaint is that I'm hungry more. My dr said I could increase to 40mg Latuda  and/or add Wellbutrin. Right now I'm okay with just 20mg Latuda.   Don't want to change anything right now.   Yes, I recommend it. I don't know whether my Medicare will cover Latuda. My dr gave me samples.",9,82
Latuda,"Increased muscle &amp; joint pain, panic/anxiety attacks, confusion, exhaustion.",0,69
Latuda,"I was on Latuda (started at 40mg and ended at 80mg) for about a month and a half before deciding to switch. The best thing about the Latuda was the significant decrease in my appetite, but that could have been an effect of removing Seroquel from my regimen. When I first started I had a very hard time sleeping due to restlessness but that went away with time. The main issues I had with Latuda were a feeling of numbness to the world around me (no desire to do anything or say anything), a definite decrease in my sex drive, and the cost. Neither of my insurance plans will cover it, so unfortunately, it's no longer an option. If you do decide to try it, take it with plenty of food, otherwise you may get nausea.",6,92
Latuda,"Latuda so far has been the best medicine I've taken.  Geodon made me really shaky but not with Latuda.  I have not gained any weight, more focused, more energy.  I am able to complete my tasks throughout the day.  Overall I feel happy and don't find the need to want to lie around all day and watch T.V. I am very pleased with Latuda.",10,117
Latuda,"I've had mostly positives with it. I do have some difficulty moving quickly at the gym because it causes dizziness, but this is a small inconvenience. It does raise my sugar, but weight loss counteracts this. It is really expensive, so I'm glad my insurance pays for it.",9,66
Latuda,"I have high hopes for Latuda! Over the past 15 years I have been treated for depression/anxiety disorder/panic attacks, and things would sometimes get a little better, but eventually get worse again. I went through a particularly awful time about a month ago, so my doctor gave me a sample of Latuda. Like many here, I felt extreme exhaustion right away, which would put me straight to sleep. However, it abated a bit after the first few days, and by a week it is not bad I have gained some weight, but I think it's because I've been eating/taking Latuda later at night. (Nothing like what I gained on Abilify) I am also waking up earlier in the morning (7 a.m. instead of my 7:30 alarm) in a good mood!",8,92
Latuda,"I don't review medicines often, but thought this might be valuable. Love this medicine, been on everything, like most of us. I take it as monotherapy for bipolar II. No bad side effects. When first started, I had a headache for a few days. That went away completely and now it helps prevent them. I also tire a little more upon exertion, but not too much. I feel slightly shaky, but even that has improved. In the beginning I had slightly restless sleep, but now have great sleep, with pleasant dreams. I feel normal, calm, happy and stable. I have NEVER felt this way. Definitely not manic at all. I have not gained or lost weight. I have no nausea and my cognition is good. I hope this helps. Give this medicine a try.",10,187
Latuda,"Never been so sick, flu like symptoms and no help with depression. I experienced anxiety and panic attacks while taking it. 3 weeks was all I could take. Back to the doctor for a medicine change. Thank God I had some Xanax to help along the way. Hope others have better luck with it than I did.",1,66
Latuda,After taking for three days had a severe anxiety attack while driving a car. Ended up an emotional wreck the rest of the night. I've never had anything like that happen.,1,83
Latuda,"I'm on 200mg Lamictal and 150mg Wellbutrin for bipolar II with mania controlled and depression affecting my daily life. Added 20mg of Latuda 3 weeks ago and I've seen massive improvement. I went from sitting at home on the couch all the time to going out and applying for jobs and completing many projects around the house. It does come with drowsiness, works better than my prescribed sleep medication, and some nausea but food solves that. I don't know if my dosage will be increased but I feel great now with all my other medications plus the Latuda. Overall the pros make the cons nonexistent in my eyes.",9,185
Latuda,This is the first medicine since I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 that makes me feel normal. I started on 20mg for a week then went up to 40mg for 5 wks now. Unfortunately my insurance won't cover it so now my Psych is giving me Abilify samples. I'm not happy about this because in past yr Latuda has worked the best without any side effects. Latuda made it possible to actually function as a mother and full time worker. I'm afraid to go on Abilify I don't want to feel crazy again especially after finally feeling normal for once.,9,148
Latuda,"I have been on all sorts of meds. Wellbutrin was beautiful but my throat swelled up and I broke out in hives. They  have tried lithium (scary rashes that took 4 months to clear) some other ones that made me worse or rashes. Latuda is the first that has been close to the awesomeness of Wellbutrin. I have more energy, eat less, fog like state of not fully being there is gone. I feel like a different person. The first week was nauseating but that went away and lasted a half hour at a time. When I bumped up to 40mg the nausea came back. My kidneys seem to be hurting but I am going with a wait and see if that goes away as well. I do not want to be taken off. Meds are hard to find that work.",8,117
Latuda,"I have tried many medications over the years, mostly antidepressants but a few others like lamotrigine &amp; Seroquel. I must say that nothing has been more effective than Latuda. I was on Wellbutrin for a couple years, was ok. This does make me drowsy so I take it at night. I do have to take with food or will make me really nauseous. Truly a miracle drug as I was not doing well.",10,136
Latuda,"For over a year I experimented with many different medicines for my Bipolar Depression without success until I started Latuda 3 months ago. I started at 20mgs, and am now at 80mgs and will be staying at this dosage. My depression has lifted, it has helped tremendously with my cognition (my brain 'fog), and I am an active participant in my own life now. As long as I take it at night with a meal or snack, I don't experience any side effects. If you take on an empty stomach, it makes you nauseous. The maker of Latuda has a patient assistance program as well. Overall, it has been a miracle for me!",10,153
Latuda,"I have Bipolar Disorder II, diagnosed 4 years ago. I've taken a wide variety of medicines during that time. In my experience, many medications are good for ending a manic episode, but nothing has ever helped me with the ensuing, longer-lasting depressions.  3 months ago my psych suggested Latuda, and I agreed with zero expectations of success.  The result has been miraculous.  Within a week of starting, all negative feelings were gone.  I experience nausea when I take it, but that is a small price to pay for such a major shift in my well-being.  My appetite remains normal, and I've lost 5 pounds since starting Latuda because I have motivation to exercise again.  Highly recommended to anyone who is BP II and wants to break out of depression.",10,191
Latuda,"My experience with Latuda was not good. At 20 mg for about a month I decided it wasn't working well but my psych asked me to try upping the dose. After a couple weeks I found that it gave me akathasia, which was far worse than my bipolar. It also increased my appetite.  I am taking 20 mg Lexapro as well, which is fairly effective for me.",2,36
Latuda,"I started taking 20 mg of Latuda in addition to the 900 mg of Lithium that I've been on for over 10 years. Even before the dosage was increased to 40 mg after one week, I noticed a difference in my mood: I became less depressed, wanted to do things like cleaning up, less withdrawn, and the suicidal thoughts disappeared. My sleeping is still not as good as it should be however even with the 25 mg of Seroquel which I sleep very poorly without. I also take Lorazepam as needed for anxiety. I am starting on 80 mg dosage of Latuda shortly, and if all goes well my psych said the Lithium may eventually be dropped.",9,92
Latuda,"Latuda has changed my life.  I've been treated with everything under the sun since I was 20 years old.  Within days of taking the Latuda I felt like a normal person.  I don't know if I EVER felt so genuinely happy, light-hearted, motivated to make life changes.  It's like a miracle.  I don't experience any side effects.  I don't feel tremendously hungry either, as I have with other anti psychotics.  I only hope it continues to keep my bipolar at bay.",10,179
Latuda,"I have been taking Latuda 40mg for a month now. I take it with meals as prescribed but I still feel nauseated. I also take Vistaril which helps with my stomach. I'm bipolar, severely anxious, along with manic depression and I found that out of ALL the meds I've tried over the past 15 years, the combination I'm taking( Vistaril 25mg, Latuda 40mg, Neurontin 300 mg 3 x a day) and Topamax 200mg at night have balanced me out very well. I still have my normal social anxieties and that's something I have to face; not a pill. If you are crying out of control, major mood swings, tired, depressed, then Latuda will help you. If you feel sick to your stomach make sure you eat first, then take it. I don't eat much so that's why mine gets upset.",0,99
Latuda,"Absolutely amazing. I have been treated for bipolar/major depression since I was an adolescent. Been on everything under the sun. Some did help-but nothing kept me consistently on an even keel. By the time my Dr gave me samples of Latuda-I had no expectations. For the first time in my adult life I feel normal. My mood is relaxed and happy-I'm sleeping well and no excessive hunger. It does kill your libido-but that is fine with me-I have lost 7 lbs. I started on 40mg and gradually increased to 120mg--I also take 300mg Wellbutrin, 30mg Adderell twice a day and Ativan as needed for anxiety. This medication is life changing.",9,108
Latuda,I took Latuda 20mg for 2 weeks. Was taking Abilify and had gained 8 pounds. Thought Latuda would help me lose weight but made me ravenous and gained 3 lbs in 4 days.  Went back on Abilify.,6,26
Latuda,I was just taken off my previous meds 200 mg Lamictal 30 mg Prozac after a week of involuntary commitment and put on 30/40 mg Latuda one daily at bedtime ..I feel confused ..manic..I'm not completely sure if I'm awake or dreaming most of the time ..I think I was given a placebo ! This crap isn't working for me.I just wanna be normal I have ZERO motivation to do anything,1,44
Latuda,"cont. So my diagnosis is Bipolar II, Panic Disorder, ADD. Wellbutrin, Lamictal, Xanx, Adderal and now this. Anyone else on so many different things? I hope I get as lucky as most of you. I've been so low over the last several months, and for the longest time my memory has been just awful.I'm always anxious. Always. I don't expect this medication to fix that, my xanax dose is increasing for that. I'm afraid of weight gain. Wellbutrin has helped me be smallr again and I can eat whatever. I'm not prepared to lose that.",0,29
Latuda,"Anyway, I literally just took my first dose of Latuda. (20mg). My psych told me to take it with dinner (I'm taking it at night. So dinner for me :) ). And emphasized how I have to eat half my dinner, take the medicine, and then eat the other half, otherwise it doesn't absorb right. That's his experience with patients any way. But after taking my first dose tonight I felt some nausea and am quite sleepy. I usually lose track of time and stay awake. I'm supposed to be taking ambien nightly for that though. So, I'm taking the ambien at night, 400MG Lamitcal (200mg twice a day), Bupropion[Wellbutrin] 300mg, 30mg Adderall 3 times a day, .5mg xanax 4 times a day, and now the Latuda 20mg. Quite the cocktail, which does make me a bit nervous.",0,31
Latuda,Has brought my anxiety and mania down. No weight gain. No other side effects. Love it. Been on it 3 months But NO sex drive. Anyone else experience this,0,63
Latuda,"I just started taking Latuda, and have found it makes me very sleepy, I'm wondering if I should take it at night instead of the morning.   I was on Wellbutrin but had to be taken off because of extreme anxiety and emotionality.",4,29
Latuda,"I have been on Latuda for about 3 years! I was struggling so much with other meds, I was either too tired, wired or depressed! Once I started taking Latuda I was feeling like a new person. I wasn't nervous or scared anymore it saved my life.",10,115
Latuda,"I have been taking Latuda for 6 months and I am bipolar II. I also am on Wellbutrin. Overall the medication has made me feel better. But I now find that I am suffering from intense anxiety, which is terrible at night. I need to check with my doctor to see if this is a possible side effect.",6,33
Latuda,"I've been diagnosed Bipolar II 3 years ago. My depressed periods were much longer than manic ones. My psychiatrist and I tried many medications without success for bipolar depression. In April, he suggested to try Latuda. I was hesitant because we already tried so many medications... but I decided to try. After a week, my depressed symptoms were almost gone. No suicidal thoughts anymore. I was feeling good and was able to determine if my bad feelings were related to my life conditions or to my bipolar condition. I noticed a decreased libido which is my only side effect. This medicine doesn't reduce my anxiety which is still very high.",10,58
Latuda,"I have been on multiple medications over 20 years for Bipolar II/ depression.  I am currently on Vivactil which has worked in the past but gives a side effect of anxiety.  My doctor prescribed Latuda 6 months ago. I sleep well now but still have some anxiety. I have also gained 35 lbs while dieting and working out. I have almost no appetite, but am still gaining weight.  Mentally a 9, but cannot continue this because I am getting depressed and having back pain due to the weight gain.",7,50
Latuda,"Began taking 20mg Latuda daily about ten days ago. About five days ago I noticed that I'm a lot less anxious - a lot less catastrophising - think more clearly, most definitely happier. My appetite is back as well. Suffering far less psychomotor retardation. Actually feel motivated to do some things! Genuine laughter! Also taking Aplenzin 522mg daily. Best I've felt in recent memory. It's my experience only.",9,74
Latuda,"Been on 20mg for only 2 weeks now and have noticed a good improvement in my mood. My dose has now been upped to 40 mg once a day. This drug so far has worked better than any antidepressant I have taken (Wellbutrin, Prozac, Effexor XR, Mirtazapine) and better than any antipsychotic I have taken (Zyprexa, Risperidone, Thorazine, Seroquel) All antipsychotics I have taken so far have caused weight gain EXCEPT THIS ONE. Since taking it for 2 weeks I have LOST 3lbs without any major exercise BUT I have dropped calorie intake to around 1000-1200 a day). The only negative side effect I have had is staying asleep for longer than 5-6 hrs . I also have social anxiety but this medication hasn't helped with that (so far if possible) Highly recommend.",8,67
Latuda,Great! Slow start but kicks in well and helps with high mania and low depression. On 160mg daily. Makes me sleepy at night so I take 1 and 1/2 at night and half in morning.  No weight gain.  Getting smarter.,10,63
Latuda,"Have tried almost everything since being diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder-I 4 years ago. I have been on 40mgs for a month now. Couldn't be happier. My time at work used to drag and make for an even more miserable day, but no longer. Happier thoughts and no mind racing. I have even been able to stop drinking alcohol while on this medicine. I guess it took away the need to self-medicate.  I take this medicine at night with dinner, but after an hour, I can't sit still yet I am very sleepy. I try to sleep but keep having to turn over and over until I fall asleep about 3 hours later. It is a miserable feeling, but sleep very well once I do fall alseep. Small price to pay for feeling so much better. Good luck to all!",9,87
Latuda,"I've been taking Latuda for 4 days now. I woke up today singing, motivated and happy. I just hope it lasts but so far this medication has changed me dramatically.",9,79
Latuda,Nothing but upset stomach all the time!  Feel like I'm going to throw up every minute of every day for 3 months now!,1,27
Latuda,"I've been struggling with Bipolar I rapid cycling for almost 10 untreated years. I've had really bad depression to the point where I was a afraid to go outside, constant racing thoughts, extreme anxiety. I was sleeping about 3 hours a day at most, and overall I couldn't function at all. I started taking Laduta 20mg for a week then went to 40mg. Soon as I started taking the medicine, I noticed a big difference the next day. I feel more stable, my depression is gone, my anxiety is gone, suicide thoughts gone. I feel like my old self again, where I can function normally and do my everyday stuff on top of being happy. This medicine literally saved my life, and I want to say thank you to the pharmaceutical company that made this.",10,118
Latuda,"I have struggled greatly with Bipolar 1 for many years. The past two years have been horrific for me. I am a rapid cycler and it has been so unrelenting that I have had to fight my company through a legal battle to stay employed through the ADA act. Finally I got a new doctor who discontinued me from taking Depakote, Klonopin, Trilifon and Trileptal. He started me on Seroquel XR which was too sedating and now I'm on 40 mg of Latuda. It is wonderful! I have only been on it for 4 days but I feel human again! My appetite is normal and I am losing all my weight from the other meds. I want to socialize and don't feel manic or depressive. So excited.",10,120
Latuda,"I've been on this medication for Bipolar I for over a year now. Recently I'm experiencing a bit of bipolar depression with irritability and anxiety, so my doctor has increased the dosage from 40 mg/day to 80, but I'm titrating up at 60 mg this week. I also take Lamotrigine at 75-100 mg/day and I already notice a positive difference, so I think it's fast-acting, which I initially noticed when I was first put on over a year ago (I posted a review here in June 2012). Some minor side effects for me are increased tension in the jaw area.",9,56
Latuda,"I started taking 40mg of Latuda alone about 6 weeks ago now. Before that, I was wondering day-to-day if I would make it. Now, aside from being sleepy (that is the biggest side effect, but who doesn't like a nice mid-day nap) I am much more productive, I can get out of bed in the morning, I don't cry uncontrollably, and best of all I don't have those same impulses I did before with shopping and drinking/etc. This really is a miracle in a way. I am on Klonopin now too help sleep, as by the time I go to bed I am all worked up, and they help. They also help for meltdowns although I am going to talk to my psych to see if upping Latuda to 80mg is wise to prevent the meltdowns altogether. 23 and happy now, who would have ever guessed.",0,75
Latuda,"I'm very frustrated.  I gained so much weight on Seroquel, but felt great.  But, I continued to gain weight so switched to Latuda.  I'm miserable.  I cannot sleep, which of course makes everything worse. I've tried it for a week and am having to switch back now. I hope I can find something eventually that helps me sleep and feel stable, but I don't gain weight.",2,42
Latuda,"First I must say that Latuda has done something for me I never thought possible from any medication. It has almost completely wiped my depression and anxiety away. I the first time I tried Latuda I woke up the next day a whole new person. I could believe it! I take Lamictal, Cymbalta and Latuda everyday. 1 mg of Ativan as needed for anxiety. My Doc replaced my Abilify with Latuda and my whole life has changed. It's expensive though and I found a lot of insurances will not pay for it without prior authorization my doc. We will see how that goes. If you feel hopeless like you have tried all the meds and nothing has worked i'm telling you to ask your Doc to put you on Latuda.",10,61
Latuda,I've been on 20mg Latuda for about 1 month. So far it has changed my life. I've had NO side effects. I was worried about weight gain but none at all. I am eating more nutritionally and wanting to take better care of myself. I have struggled brutally with bipolar depression and attempted suicide several times not really wanting to die but to stop the horrific depression. I guess now there's a reason I'm still here. I hope I'm not being too premature in thinking this might last. But for now I'm taking it one day at a time and enjoying the moment. Best medication I've ever had so far. THANK YOU to whoever invented this!,10,137
Latuda,"Before Latuda, I had become scared. thought everyone was lying to me. I had become violent, screaming, crying for long periods, sitting in the dark for hours, staying home. I started on 40mg daily. I noticed within 2 days I was thinking clearer and feeling less anxious. I was still having meltdowns about every three days, so we went to 80mg six weeks ago. I have been much happier, more productive and sleeping better. I take it at night. The worst side effect I had was swelling around my ankles. But that went away. I'm losing weight. No longer eat in my sleep. It hasn't fixed all, but it has me on the right track to trying to get well. Before Latuda, I didn't care about getting well. I Hope and pray it keeps working.",8,98
Latuda,"Within the first couple of days I felt way more productive.  Not as lazy, I feel happier and my mood has improved.  Definitely recommend it. I also take Viibryd.",10,61
Latuda,"I've been taking Latuda 40mg once a day in the evening  for 1 month for BiPolar.  I had been on various meds throughout my life for depression started when I had postpartum with both my children.  I am 45 now and my children are 17/14. I was on was Lexapro for depressrion for quite sometime that seems to run its course with me. Oh was diagnosed with MS in 1992 so add that piece to the puzzel.As far as Latuda,  I have mixed feelings. It seems to help me with focus and cognitive deficiencies, which I could be MS related.  Depression is there but not as it was, but I still cry and at times stay in my head too long.  I seem to be more agitated with my children.  Ativan helps with Anxiety when needed. I will be seeing my psych tomorrow to discuss.",7,37
Latuda,I gained almost 50 pounds in six months on this medicine. I have since switched to Saphris and lost all but 7 pounds.,0,39
Latuda,"I am now more productive, NOT sleepy, and Happy! No more suicidal thoughts! I want to be involved in my family and their needs. I have been on 5 meds before Latuda, this has changed my life! I look forward to every next day.",10,136
Latuda,"I've only been on Latuda for a week, what a difference it has made in my mood. It has lifted the depression &amp; debilitating anxiety. I take it along with Depakote &amp; Klonopin (both of which I've been on for many years). I take it at night because it makes me sleepy. It does give me a lump in the throat sensation, for some reason, about an hour and 1/2 after I take it and that feeling lasts about 2-3 hours.  The next day it's gone.  I will talk with my psych PA about it, to see what it may be.  I haven't had this much motivation in a very long time, and it's not a manic or hypomanic feeling, I just feel like living again.  I hope it continues to work well and doesn't cause any intolerable side effects.",9,90
Latuda,So my experience with this medication is a good one.  I have tried just about everything for bipolar with schizoeffective features but this is the only thing that seems to keep me out of the hospital.  I don't overeat on this medication and I don't have hardly any side effects. I am currently taking 80mg at night and I seem to be getting quality sleep and feeling as good as you can feel with bipolar disorder the next day.  I don't give it a 10 because I still have some unusual thoughts but I have yet to take a medication that can completely take care of them or I think they are also called intrusive thoughts. If you read this I hope your experience with this medication will be as good as mine.,9,87
Latuda,I have been taking Latuda 80 mg for 8 months and am on no other medications for medication induced bipolar disorder which was caused by antidepressants prescribed for anxiety.  Latuda should be taken with 350 calories but when I took the medicine with food I was completely engulfed in anxiety within an hour.  Now I take it at night with no food.  I sleep for 12 hours at night and feel pretty good but am easily irritated.  I had the genetic testing which indicated that I MAY be a rapid metabolizer of this medicine so I'm not sure if I am not getting enough of the medicine (because I am not taking it with food) and that is the cause of my irritability or if 80mg is causing irritability.,3,36
Latuda,"Been on Latuda 40MG for about three weeks. I'm still having some depression, sadness, but not nearly what I was when I first started on it. My Psych DOC and I are considering a jump to 80MG, but I'll be trying to get pregnant soon. Other than that, I think it's doing okay.",8,26
Latuda,"Latuda took away the voices, but caused me to have bad thoughts and depression especially at night. It however, allowed me to lose 20 lbs. I discontinued it and started on Geodon last week my mood has dramatically improved and I feel great.  Hopefully it doesn't cause weight gain.",3,24
Latuda,I was on deep depression. Effexor was not working any more and was having deep suicidal thought. Then my doctor added Latuda 40 mg. Miracle! No more suicidal thought and my bipolar depression ceased by 80%. The only problem is make me sleep when I take in the morning and make me awake when I take it at supper. Taking it at lunch causes a little less sleepiness. Another feature is that it control my severe anxiety.,9,66
Latuda,"I have Bipolar1 Disorder with history of psychotic features. I have just started taking 40 mg of Latuda per day, as I am being weened from 900 mg of lithium.  I was having so many adverse side effects, such as tremors, extreme dry mouth, weight gain and thyroid issues.  Additionally, it didn't seem to be working very well.  After a few days, I notice an amazing positive change in my mood, my appetite, and stability.  I am still on 800 mg. of Seroquel/day and 150 mg of Pristiq, but it all continues to go well, Seroquel will be the next to be reduced.  I am very optimistic, and have not felt this way in a long time.",10,65
Latuda,"I have been taking Latuda for about three weeks now for bipolar II.  I don't suffer too badly from it, mostly slight depression and irritability. Started week one on 40 mg and was still slightly depressed but not cranky. Upped it to 80 mg and am feeling sunshiny again. Positive attitude is back, interest in things, no longer cranky, more focused, more outgoing. The only MAJOR problem is I am sleepy all the time! I tried taking it at dinner, bedtime, and lunch. I pass out out at 8:30 at night, can't get up in the morning and fight to stay awake at my desk at work. I have read lots of other posts that people have said it passes after a month or so, I really hope so because otherwise its a great med. No other side effects for me.",7,85
Latuda,"Struggled with undiagnosed bipolar disorder for 8 years. Finally got on the right cocktail with Latuda included. I'm at 60mg and it has stopped my cycling (I'm a rapid cycler). No side effects, except for weight loss and difficulty gaining it back (which may be great for some of you, but I'm a former anorexic so not so great on that front). Did not change my intake of food ... but the med definitely decreased my appetite. Would HIGHLY recommend giving this med a go. And I've been on practically everything -- this is literally the only thing that has made my life live-able again.",10,126
Latuda,"I was diagnosed with Bi-Polar II after being told I had Depression for about 2 years. My doctor prescribed me WellButrin, which I am still on and love. Following, I was put on Prozac to take my edge off and I took it for 2 years but it gave me horrible nightmares and I am now off of it. My doctor then prescribed me Latuda. I have been on it for about 3-4 weeks and have loved it. Before I was diagnosed with type II I had no idea why I would be so upset one day but feel great with an abundance of energy the next day. It was my cycles. I cycle very frequently, however, the Latuda has helped me stay constant and stable. I don't get upset over stupid things anymore (and they were stupid) and now have a better capability of letting things go.",10,107
Latuda,"I took this medicine while I was pregnant, it was difficult in the 1st 2 weeks. I had a lot of anxiety and I went to sleep really fast but after that the medicine worked perfectly and I was very happy with it. My baby was born full term and very healthy but now I'm nursing and I had to stop taking Latuda, that was a bad idea. I feel horrible right now, I need to go back on the medicine.",9,44
Latuda,"I've been on Abilify seems forever. It did work well except for my sleep. So I began Latuda 4 weeks ago and so far my sleep is really improved and so has my moods. I haven't had any side effects except for the sexual one, which they all seem to take away from that. Highly recommend Latuda. Very expensive though.",8,82
Latuda,"Since starting on 80 mg Latuda along with Buproprion my Bi-Polar mood swings are at bay, I feel no social anxiety or awkwardness and am not fearful much like I used to be. I am more like the authentic self I was when I was younger before my diagnosis: outgoing, articulate, motivated, upbeat/hopeful, productive, stable &amp; high-functioning + energetic. I have been able to quit coffee, cigarettes &amp; carbs due to my new found motivation, will be transferring to a large University soon, function better under pressures of work &amp; motherhood &amp; find it much easier to maintain my 12 Step Recovery Program &amp; stay clean &amp; sober too! I would highly recommend Latuda for anyone lacking focus, drive or positive feelings to see if it effects you as profoundly.",10,142
Latuda,"I took Latuda 40 mg for a week and then 80 the next week. I had to stop halfway through week 2 because I wasn't sleeping and I was feeling more agitated. Actually, it made my bipolar worse. I was up and down and up and down within a matter of minutes.",1,48
Latuda,"As far as I'm concerned it's a miracle medicine for bipolar. A week and a half ago I was so bad off that I didn't want to live. My mother called my shrink at about 6PM, he called in a prescription, and I took 20mg at around 7PM. When I woke up the next morning I felt fine, and I've pretty much been that way since. Some of it may be due to the placebo effect, but I don't think a whole lot because such a dramatic improvement has never occurred when I've started other medicines.",10,89
Latuda,"This has been a miracle! I went from avoiding everyone and everything even cleaning or talking to friends. I've started doing everything around the house, I've been able to stand up for myself. I'm happy every day. Gone are the I'm having a bad day, only drawback 1st 3 weeks I had to take it at bedtime because I was very nervous and jittery, that subsided, no problems with stomach have not lost any weight but I'm much more active. Like night and day difference. I'm so happy.",10,108
Latuda,"Bipolar 2 with psychotic features (voices/some visual when it's real bad) Week 3 of Latuda now on 120mg to replace 800mg of Seroquel. Last dose of Seroquel will be this Thursday. Taking Lithium, Lamictal (I like this one too), Topamax, several more psych meds as required, and asthma meds. Latuda is GREAT! My mood is slightly on the manic side, but sleep is perfect, so a little (safe) fun is just fine by me. Everybody around me has noticed the change. I'll let things settle for a couple months and ask the psych to drop the Topamax some (I think it messes with my memory at 300mg). So far no weight loss on the Latuda like the rest of you seem to have noticed, but the rest is so great, I'm all in.",10,61
Latuda,"I was switched from Abilify (which was amazing), to Lamictal (horrible, didn't work), to Latuda.  I'd say that Latuda is a great medication for me.  I have no side effects, have finally been able to get on a normal sleep schedule, and haven't had any manic episodes.  I feel normal again!  I take 40mg at night.  I also take Celexa 40mg daily and 1mg Ativan as needed.  I also take a lot of vitamins.  I've been taking Latuda for 8 months.",10,62
Latuda,"I love this medication because it has cleared my head and made me feel a lot more stable. I also take Luvox, Lamictal and Klonopin for Panic Disorder and insomnia. Even before going on Latuda, I was having severe insomnia but only at night. I have had problems with that all my life, however. The Klonopin helps me sleep during the day but not at night as it was doing. Despite the great effects of Latuda, I recently went off of it because for several hours after I take it, I am so restless I can't stop moving. Doc recommended Cogentin but I don't want to be on any more meds than necessary. However, after going off the Latuda, I went manic and then crashed. I think I may give it a go again, WITH the Cogentin this time. I have Bipolar 1.",8,42
Latuda,"I have Bipolar 1 with psychotic features. Since being put on Latuda, my mood swings have lessened considerably, and I am no longer experiencing any psychotic symptoms. My doctor was so pleased with the improvements that he gave me the okay to go to college. I am in my first week of college, hours away from home and have never felt better. I experienced akathesia with Latuda, so my doctor prescribed Cogentin to combat that and it helps a lot. Overall, I would say Latuda has helped me get my life on track and my symptoms under control.",9,48
Latuda,"Some nausea, severe vomiting when I first began...better now. It knocks me out pretty quick, so I take it at night along with 300mg of Lamictal and 150mg of Trazodone. The worst side effect I've noticed is EXTREME fatigue. I can't seem to get enough sleep. Otherwise, its definitely a step in the right direction. 2 weeks and counting- If the fatigue thing doesn't let up I'll probably have to stop it and move on to something else (its that bad). Also curbs my appetite considerably.",6,45
Latuda,"I haven't seen anyone else discuss this, but Latuda gave me A LOT of anxiety.  Within 2 hours after taking the medication I would be in full freak out mode.  Also, my lower legs felt tingly.  These issues tended to last anywhere from 2-7 hours after I took it (at 4pm).  I gave it a 3 because I think it was otherwise working for what I'd hoped. My irritability disappeared completely.  However, because of the side-effects I'm off and looking for something else. (I also take lithium and Lamictal).",3,43
Latuda,I have been on Latuda 40mg since January 2012. I was prescribed it to help me sleep because I suffer with a severe case of insomnia. I had tried many different types of medicines to help knock me out. My Dr had tried Saphris but I was experiencing all the severe side effects. So my Dr discontinued that medicine and started me on Latuda 40mg. The medicine worked very well with my mood swings and insomnia. It wasn't until the past couple weeks that I haven't been able to sleep anymore. So my Doctor decided to increase my dosage to 80mg. I'm on night one but its 4:30am and still not sleeping. I'm also on Depakote and Lexapro.,7,25
Latuda,"I am honestly not sure how to rate this medication but I can relate my experience so far.  I have had no nausea, it does help me sleep better.  I was given the medication for bipolar.  I have been emotionally shut down for a long time and after 3 days it has opened up my emotions and I am not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing.  In February my husband died of an accidental cocaine overdose.  The only emotion I have felt since he died is anger.  Now I feel over whelmed with grief and I am just not sure how to deal with that.",5,42
Latuda,"Started with a month on 40mg and am now increased to 80mg. Happy that it's not making me too sleepy, actually waking around 5am, well before my alarm. Have lost some weight so happy with that. Still on the manic side so I asked for the increase and had my husband change my amazon password so I can't continue a spending spree. Some muscle soreness, not sure if that's the Latuda. And feeling like I over heat easily. Overall the side effects are tolerable and some of them welcomed. It's the first mood stabilizer that I haven't had horrible side effects with. I actually feel like it's helping me function better.",8,52
Latuda,"I was started at 40mg and got mild nausea but doing good mood wise.  Increased to 80mgs and starting getting physically sick within 20 minutes of taking it.  It would have made a good diet medicine for me, but that is not why I was on it.",1,22
Latuda,"I have been taking 40mg Latuda for about 2 weeks.  No side effects and it does not make me drowsy. I take it with dinner and I'm fine until I go to bed at 9pm.  I fall asleep fine and wake up refreshed. I feel so much better - I have been able to stop taking Depakote and Ambien. Now, I'd like to get off the Lithium. I still have anxiety and irritability but now I can get ahold of myself and see reason and calm down on my own. I would highly recommend. It is expensive though.",9,43
Latuda,"I take 40 mg of Latuda nightly with a titration dose of 25-75 mg Lamogotrine (Lamictal) for bipolar I. Within a day of taking it, my mood brightened, I was able to wake up in the morning without malaise, and experienced a loss of appetite. I much prefer this to Depakote and Wellbutrin. I was not compliant with the Depakote due to the side effects of a huge appetite and the fact that it made me feel like a zombie. After a manic episode, I needed to recommit to compliance again, but abruptly stopped taking Depakote and Risperdone (prescribed right after manic episode) due to side effects. After a couple of weeks of no medicines, the Latuda/Lamotrigine cocktail made life so much brighter.",9,51
Latuda,"I have been on Latuda for about 2 months now, I take 120mg at about 8-8:45pm every night. Positives are that it makes me have almost no manic episodes and very few mood switches. It has also helped with my sleep. Before I was getting about 2-4 hours asleep at most each day. Now with the Latuda I sleep from about 9pm till 10am. The struggles I have with it are that it makes it very very hard to get up in the morning for school or whatever unless I get to sleep in until my body is ready. It has also made it very hard for me to eat. Since starting I have lost nearly 15 pounds. Other than that Latuda has made a huge impact on my life. I'm finally starting too feel like how a normal 16yr old should!",9,61
Latuda,Seems to really help stabilize me. I am not sure how long this medicine has been out for.,7,20
Latuda,"I started Latuda after being on risperidone for a couple of months.  Latuda has gotten better and better. Much less anxiety, more focused, less drowsy. I exercise a lot now too which I think helps a lot though.  The only thing is it makes me a little nauseated right after I take it which is before bedtime.",9,40
Latuda,I've been taking Latuda since about November. I also take Klonopin to help me sleep which it doesn't seem to be doing anymore. I take my Latuda in the evening. I've also noticed a huge drop in my sexual appetite and it definietly has suppressed my appetite. I don't eat much don't really have much of an appetite at all. I've started waking with a lot of muscle pain over the past week or so I see my Dr. again on the 16th and am going to ask him if this is usual which it seems to be from other people. I honestly like this medication more than most others I've been on and it's nice to lose the weight my old medications made me gain. I have a hard time waking up and usually sleep till about noon.,7,62
Latuda,"I have had great experience so far with Latuda. I started taking 40 mg in Nov., and it worked great for about a week, then I crashed again. Dr. put it up to 80 mg and I've been great ever since. I'm afraid, though, because my sex drive has completely disappeared, and if it's the Latuda, I'm going to have to go off it-and I hate to go off something that's working so well. However, I'm also on a pretty high dose of Lexapro, and the Dr. thinks it's more likely to be a side effect of that, so we're decreasing that and hopefully that will work, because otherwise I'm feeling really good. I'm really afraid I'll have to go off it.",8,40
Latuda,"I started Latuda about a month ago. Its hard to know if is truly working because I am trying to come off of 300 mg of Seroquel. Whoever wrote Latuda made them restless, this happened to me too so my doctor gave me Cogentin and it worked. I'm still hungry all the time but once I'm off Seroquel I shouldn't be. I also take Vyvanse, Lorazepam, Restoril, and Keppra which is for my seizure disorder. I say Latuda is an 8 so far my paranoia is gone.",8,32
Latuda,"I have Bi-Polar and have been on Latuda for 3 days. Until reading your post, I was going to take myself off.  The irritability is through the roof and right now I am in my manic mode, getting up everyday at 4:00, so lack of sleep doesn't help.  My thoughts are foggy.  But I am giving this medicine 2 weeks, I should know by then. Latuda replaced the Risperdal, I am on 1500 lithium, Klonopin, Prozac, and Vyvanse.  So I hope to feel as good as all of you.  Thanks for your experiences.",1,41
Latuda,"7 days ago my psych added Latuda 80mg a night to my usual diet of 300mg lithium and 0.5 mg Ativan (when required).  The first two days as he tapered me up to 80mg of Latuda I was tired almost sedated and super relaxed.  My horrible rapid cycling has stopped, paranoia significantly lessened. I have only cried 3 TIMES this week and I feel amazingly like my old self again.  I'm almost afraid its to good to be true and suddenly side effects are going to start.  But so far so good!  The only thing I've noticed is that I am eating again. I was having so much anxiety my food was choking me.  I am not gaining weight, just able to relax enough to eat.  I am hoping it will continue working and I will be able to wean off the lithium because of the side effects.",8,52
Latuda,"I've been on Latuda for several months, recently increased to 60 mg.  At first, I thought it was pretty good, subtle improvements.  Now it's hard to say.  I have intense intrusive thoughts every day, suicidal and I've begun hearing music in the distance (like tinnitus, but music instead of ringing.)  The former two existed to some degree before I started Latuda, the latter is brand new.  Most noted side effect:  EXTREMELY sedating for 2-3 hours abruptly followed by intense restlessness, need to move.  Haven't figured out a good time of day to take it for this reason. Take it in the morning, I'm fighting drowsiness half the day.  Take it in the evening, I'm wide awake until 2 AM.  Also, nausea.  Other medicines I take: Lamictal, Prozac, Cardizem, Ativan.",7,50
Latuda,I had been on Latuda for two months.  Great medicine except I had severe muscle weakness.,1,38
Latuda,"I am diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and ADHD. I take Straterra for ADHD, which stopped the anxiousness, and I just started Latuda two days ago. It has been a dream! Since I have had such difficultly responding to several bipolar medicines that were prescribed, it is so refreshing to have found a medicine that makes me feel like myself without the moods. I am so grateful! However my only struggle with Latuda has affected my sleep slightly, I am a bit more restless when I sleep, but I have been compensating this issue with taking melatonin.. not a big issue for the amount of positives I am experiencing! Hopefully it will improve with continued use.",9,79
Latuda,I am taking 900mg of lithium for bipolar and Seroquel. I was on 600mg and it made me gain 20 pounds in 3 weeks so I got off also due to high cholesterol. and I was put on Latuda last week. I threw up the 1st two days taking it and it was hell but now I'm used to it and feel calm and sleep better. So far so good. Stopped gaining and now I don't care to eat as much. GREAT.,5,54
Latuda,I have been on Latuda now for three weeks and am quite pleased.  My anger and agitation level is tolerable (great difference).  My manic is still elevated but where I like it.  First week I had bouts of headaches that have since passed.  I can't take it at dinner because I only last about an hour and a half after taking it.  Only issue I'm struggling with right now is although I get tired from the pill I can't fall asleep.,9,69
Latuda,"I've been on Latuda for 3 months after being on Lithium for Bipolar Disorder and have experienced nothing but great results. Lithium which I was on for 10 years began to rot my teeth because of dry mouth so I asked for a new medicine and the Doctor told me Latuda was brand new and is used primarily for schizophrenia but is used for Bipolar also. About 5 days into treatment I had experienced noticeable changes. They were a sense of calm without the tunnel vision and tiredness. I am a little more manic but not bad it's more like just being awake more not bouncing off the walls. I sleep about 3 hours less but because of the awake aspect of the medicine you can't really notice. So, I say it's an excellent medicine and is worth a try.",10,97
Latuda,"I started taking Latuda 4 days ago for bipolar. So far I have noticed a change in my mood. Days are brighter and I'm not hungry which is a good thing. I am still taking Lamictal, Dexedrine and Ativan. I am still having trouble with racing thoughts while asleep. I hope this will change soon.",6,56
Latuda,"Irritable, agitated, impatient, anxious and increased anger.",2,69
Latuda,"I am in month 2 of taking Latuda. I have bipolar with psychotic features. When I started Latuda it was bad. I was sleeping all day and night. Then it switched... I was going to sleep at 10pm and would be wide awake at 4 am. I have lost weight since starting it which is welcome due to having gained weight on lithium. My moods are great and any irritability I experience subsides quickly. I have had no psychotic thoughts or actions since I started the Latuda. Even better, it has barely any side effects. I do notice a tiny bit of anxiety and restless legs though. But not every night. REMEMBER TO TAKE WITH 350 CALORIES OF FOOD.",8,121
Latuda,"Latuda is awesome, I've been on it for about 3 weeks and I seem to be feeling better every day.  I am also on Prozac, Dexedrine, and Klonopin.  But we switched out Zyprexa for Latuda and it's been a miracle so far, I don't really notice many side effects and I'm losing weight like crazy and not trying to.  I hope it keeps up the good things.",9,102
Latuda,"I've been taking 400mg of Lamictal a day for about 3 years now and my doctor suggested adding Latuda to the mix. When I first started taking 40 mg of Latuda I was getting a headache, which made me panic. So we cut it down to 10mg twice a week and it seems to be working well. Just enough to get by. As posted earlier I felt it kind of hard to get up in the morning when taking Latuda at night. I take it before bed in fear of having that panicky headache thing going on again.",7,45
Latuda,Latuda has helped me so much with my anxiety and depression.  I'm taking 20 mg once a day and I feel great.,10,75
Latuda,"I was recently taken off of lithium for bipolar because of my thyroid problems. I am very happy with Latuda. It works quickly and makes me feel normal for the most part. I have only had a little irritability, but it quickly subsided.  The main problem I have had with Latuda is drowsiness. I take it at night, but am still having a difficult time waking up. I'm going to try taking it earlier, like right after dinner, and see if that helps me wake up earlier. I have to wake up by 6:00 a.m. once school starts again since I am a teacher.  I have been waking up around 10:00 a.m., and don't think that will work. I recommend trying Latuda!",9,63
Latuda,I have taken Latuda for about 2 weeks for Bipolar Depression. I also take Prozac and Depakote. I have never had a medicine work so quickly and dramatically. I can feel again...love for my family...optimism...although I am not sleeping as I did before. I have gone from 12-13 hours/night to 6-8 hours/night. I have had brief episodes of irritability but so far have been able to resolve them quickly. I feel better than I have in years.,9,153
Latuda,I take this for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Was taking 850 Mg of Seroquel 1 in the morning 1 in the afternoon and 2 at night before bed time. I have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. This is something like having both schizophrenia and bipolar at the same time. I did not like taking Seroquel because it made me gain weight and I felt like I always had to keep moving. I was put on Latuda 40 MG and it seems to work. I have been taking it for a week now. Almost no side effects. I am still here and see things that are not there but the Latuda helps me know what is real and not and it helps me better handle them. It works as good as any other one I have tried but side effect free. I highly recommend trying this out.,9,73
Latuda,"I am on day 4 of Latuda. I am weaning off of Saphris which was like a miracle as far as effects and stabilization of mood (despite horrible taste). The taste of Saphris eventually made it very difficult to take consistently so my prescriber chose Latuda at 40 mg to swallow daily. Already noticing a maintaining balance of mood despite drastic decrease in Saphris. I hope that Latuda will work just as well as Saphris, if not better. More review to follow but initial reaction is a positive one.",8,59
Latuda,"I have been on Latuda 8 days.  I have loss of appetite but have been emotionally balanced, slight headache.  Maybe from not eating very much.  Mood is good.",0,94
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 This drug Seroquel made me feel like a zombie. Sure it would make me feel normal but it would completely knock me out. I was with some friends and I was going to give them a ride home from my house and accidentally took my medication too early and I literally passed out and they had to get a ride from a friend. I was only at a 50 mg dose. This medication was just not for me. I take Latuda now, which made me really drowsy when I first started taking it but I have since gotten over it.",0,3
Quetiapine,"I started taking quetiapine two weeks ago thinking they were just sleeping pills from my psychiatrist cause I had some days where I just couldn't sleep and didn't realize I was manic. She made it sound like they were just for sleep cause she knows how much I don't want to be on antipsychotics. Anyways I went through a tough breakup which didn't help the body or mind when I started taking these. I find I have great sleeps, great dreams, and my mood has significantly improved. Mind you I was put on other antipsychotics last year that zombified me to the point that friends were extremely concerned I'd never be myself again. I'd say the worst side effects for me on quetiapine has been runny poos, nauseous every morning to the point I can not eat solids, I've lost a bit of weight but am actively trying to maintain it, and I'll get extremely emotional suddenly without having a reason. I'm going to continue taking them and talk to my psychiatrist soon. ALSO MY DRY MOUTH IS AWFUL AT TIMES",8,0
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 I can, now, see my own sign of mania or depression (having had Dialectical Behavioral therapy for six months). With that said, the meds are not miracles and after some dialectical treatment to add to my  tool box ... seroquel really helps. When I am restless, racing thoughts and moody I feel well balance after about 48-72 hours after using  coping skills  plus adding seroquel to prevent lack of sleep which induces worsening of thoughts, moods, eating, etc. For me, its very helpful to have self-relaxation skills to level my reactions. I give this medication, after months of skill work, A++. My experience is not to say it is 100% fluent to all bipolar sufferers. Good thing DBT is not a medication so wont hurt to try it as a  tool .  The side-effects are mild. It does make me drowsy and sometimes do get oily face... yet, I can accept that over extended episodes. I also have to keep drinking lots of water as dry mouth is mild and do feel thirsty.",0,8
Quetiapine,<b>Seroquel XR (quetiapine):</b>			 Finally was able to get back on Quetiapine after adding fiber pills to my diet and I am loving sleep.  Spent my whole life not sleeping well or at all lately (was up for almost a week a straight last year).  Quetiapine IR was a sure fire way of knocking me out within an hour and staying asleep to well into the morning. Pretty groggy though and had to keep increasing my dose.  My Pdoc recently sent the XR version into pharmacy instead and it is rather different. I dont get knocked out right away which means I can create a better sleep hygiene routine.  If I am more relaxed I dont need to be put to sleep but gradually work my way into it. It does take a minute to fully wake up but I have to say I feel my overall mood remains pretty stable for most of the rest of the day.,0,6
Quetiapine,"I have been taking Seroquel since 2014 for unwanted, intrusive, negative thoughts during episodes of bipolar 2 depression.  At 500-600 mg per day, the drug works great.  The only time I have problems is when I attempt to lower the doze below 500 mg per day.  I sleep very well with Seroquel and it has given me my life back. Negative thoughts still happen but they are given proper perspective with no obsession.  I have not gained weight or noticed any other side effects.  Seroquel has been a game changer for me.",9,18

I was still irritable (because I was exhausted) and therefore becoming depressed again, the doctor gave me a script and initially said to half a 25mg tablet, just to get me over the edge. I agree in terms of the body adjusting to it, half a tablet didn't do anything for me after about a month, but 2 months on 1 tablet still works wonders.

After taking it, I would still be awake for a couple hours trying to sleep and still having racing thoughts. In the morning, I had the worst experiences trying to wake up. I wasnt trying to wake up early or anything, like 11 on my free days so I could sleep in, and even then I could barely open my eyes enough to turn off my alarm and would immediately fall back asleep. After finally waking up, I felt groggy and disoriented throughout the day. I couldnt think straight, and was unable to focus during my classes. Not a good experience.

I must take it 45 minutes before I want to go to sleep as that seems to be exactly when it kicks in! It can cause dry mouth and difficulty swallowing. In addition, make sure you take it and then get 6-8 hours of sleep. Otherwise you will be groggy in the morning. I think it is a life saver.

I was having to titrate up relatively quickly approaching the more antipsychotic dosage and away from the sleepy doses.  But then constipation hit pretty bad after about a week of having a hard time going to bathroom that led me to eating less and less, until I was so weak I had to eat a big meal to get through the day.

From day 1, just the starting dose (25mg, which is nothing compared to the effective dose for Bipolar II) gave me:  -Migraines that couldn't be reduced in severity by any means, nonstop, the entire week. -Hunger/thirst that felt wrong and didn't go away after eating/drinking water. -Jaw stiffness, separate from the migraines. -An upward spike in agitation and restlessness.  -A similarly strong up-spike in dark thoughts after day four. -Cotton mouth/grogginess when I woke up every morning.

Quetiapine,Was diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar disorder and was first prescribed to take half of a 25mg quetiapine at night (Im very sensitive to meds). It knocked me out fast and Id have great sleeps with vivid dreams but could not for the life of me get out of bed in the morning. The next-day grogginess subsided when I was prescribed to take 15mg Adderall in the morning. But after a week I started waking up in the night gasping for air (usually after a dream of drowning or being crushed) and sometimes restless leg syndrome so bad Id cry from anger. Not sure if it was a bad mix or what but it did not work for me unfortunately.,3,3

Dr said everything was fine. Called my psych and let her know of situation and she wanted to see test results.  She said it was probably anxiety and was aware of major heart issues in my family.  Said to increase lorazepam and see her immediately.  Went to see her and looked at QT interval prolongation and changed med to Latuda.

It is ridiculous that some of the doctors who aggressively medicate and aren't cautious because the right dose of helpful medication can be life saving while a bad approach can cause instability that caused serious problems in my life.

What I decided to do was actually up my dose with my doctor so that the effects of sleepiness would kick in before the hunger. I take 200mg Seroquel at night with a combination of 300 mg  Wellbutrin XR for depression and 150 mg Lamictal for mood stabilizing during the day. I take 15 mg of BuSpar twice a day for anxiety. I got off all of these when I was pregnant and was complete basket case. This drug cocktail worked for 10 years and I spiralled when I went off of it. Since Ive been back on my meds four months Im completely normal again; functioning at a high-level. I run a very successful business and I know that I could not do it without these medications. I have virtually no side effects except for if I stay awake for too long after taking the Seroquel I will get on uncontrollable hunger.

I also had my suicidal ideation and thoughts get overwhelmingly worse. My psychiatrist increased my dosage and it just got worse. I had to change psychiatrists (unrelated to this) and my new psychiatrist immediately had me taper down my dosage with the goal of getting off the Seroquel completely. Once I got off of it completely, I felt like a new person - no depression or suicidal thoughts since. I know this med has helped a lot of people and I am so happy it has.

Quetiapine,"Works a bit for bipolar at first but now my symptoms are back at full speed. My problem with this med is that it gives me insomnia if I take more than 100 mg. It helps me sleep at lower dosages but doesn't help with the depression part of my mood swings. Also, when I first started taking this, I couldn't wake up in the mornings at all. My boyfriend would poke me to see if I was still alive. It still makes me very groggy in the mornings and is the reason I started drinking caffeinated tea before I could function every morning. My cousin takes it for bipolar and he takes 500 mg! but he never sleeps or sleeps or sleeps all the time on this med.

My brain doesnt fully function till after noon most days. I became a coffee drinker at 35 years old as a result.  Every so often I forget to bring a pill with me on an overnight. I wouldnt say I sleep without it.  I seem to stay in a semiconscious state.  The following day however; my brain is very sharp without the sedating effect. Im hoping I can reach some middle ground between mental sharpness and adequate nightly sleep.  Ive read all the current reviews on this sight.  The medication really seems to be patient specific. The only constant I see is the weight gain and grogginess.  Has anyone lowered their dose and had less grogginess as a result?,7,6

A specialist also told me once that in larger doses, its isn't as much of a tranquilizer as the smaller doses which I can also confirm from my on experience.

What I dont like about it, is that you get used to the dose very quickly and the symptoms return needing to either up or lower the dose. Its not a super stable medicine. The first days of upping the dose you do feel more stable, calmer, peaceful but a week after you find yourself asking for more. Now therapeutically, it brings you back to earth, you know, but its not enough. In my case the lack of motivation is a big thing for me.

Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 The Cons: higher appetite, weight gain, diabetes, cognitive dulling. The Pros: I take 800/day all at night and once a quarter I accidentally double dose and feel perfect after that.  I just slept for 24 hrs during a stay-cation and wow do I feel good and sharp.  So my employer is aware of my condition and we structure my workload, such that I do serious creative computer programming in the afternoon after the dulling wears off.  My advice is to take it all at 8pm and get in bed at 8:30 - 9:00.  Then you will be able to do normal work at 9am and complex work after noon.  Diet and exercise are key, because you have to manage the diabetes that comes with it.  If I feel depressed or manic, I might add 400mg and that usually fixes it, but that is probably risky.  Also note that the generic is really cheap now, under $25/month at max legal dose.  Or $54 for 3 months worth.",0,10

If stayed awake more than 30 minutes after taking it , you will feel hungry , so if you are worried about gaining weight just take it and sleep.  Find your correct dose that works well , and remember good sleep equals good mood. If you feel sleepy the next day , thats if ' drink some coffee + 1 cup of water.

Quetiapine,"I started taking Seroquel about four years ago.  I was a severe alcoholic at the time.  I was once up to 900 mg daily.  I quit drinking over a year ago.  I switched to a new medication because of weight gain.  Latuda did nothing for me.  In addition once I was completely off Seroquel my anxiety and insomnia went through the roof.  It was so severe that my doctor put me back on Seroquel.  I have been diagnosed with bipolar type II, generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD.  My doctor started seeing me every two weeks, and we were finally able to find my magic dose which is 200mg at bedtime.  He also added lithium. I am very pleased with Seroquel.  I know that many people can't tolerate it because it is a hard drug, but for me it works great",9,4

Quetiapine,"I took Quetiapine (Seroquel) for a little over a year. The pro's of this medication are that it helps me sleep and seems to tackle bipolar depression quite nicely. It also seems to make me less volatile and capricious. The con's unfortunately became too much. I gained over 50 pounds during my time on the drug, my blood pressure sky-rocketed and no amount of healthy eating or exercise helped me lose weight and keep it off. I have the appetite of a racehorse when I take it in the evening and my binging became dangerous. I also sustained a number of injuries to my legs and feet because my body couldn't keep up with the rapid weight gain during exercise. It's a good med, but be mindful that it causes weight gain!",5,2
Quetiapine,"I took 100mg of XR and it worked pretty well to stabilize my bipolar tendencies. However, it made the whole world feel bland and neutral... nothing in my life felt particularly exciting or even depressing. Also, if I didn't sleep at least 10h per night, I would feel drowsy and out of it the next day. I was literally a walking zombie and waking up in the morning was a true battle. My doc told me that the tiredness would go away after a couple of weeks/months but after a little more than 7 months the effects were still the same so I stopped taking it.",3,2
Quetiapine,<b>Seroquel XR (quetiapine):</b>			 I was on immediate release version of Seroquel 200mg and the side effects were horrible! Everlasting hungover and craving for foods like if it's a drug or I would be going withdraw aka blood sugar crashes. So my Dr switched to seroquel 200mg extended release and it was a GODSEND form of drug! Barely any of sedating effects and even lack of any hungover....

I never had any of that before; my bipolar destroyed my whole life. Seroquel gave it back. I hear of people wanting to go off Seroquel.. I'm the opposite.  I would go to any lengths to make sure I never have to go off it. I'll gladly spend the rest of my life on it, because it gives me a normal life, and I won't risk that for anything.

My psychiatrist put me back on the 25 mg pill as needed. I rarely used it and this time I didn't gain any weight from it, which I was relieved about.

I used to have to take 2 six week leaves a year. I feel much more positive about my job and my life in general. It has been a game changer for me. The only down side is the weight gain. It seems to slow your metabolism down and increase your appetite after taking it, making it difficult to loose weight. I am currently not overweight, so the weight gain is a small price to pay.

Granted I'm weaning off of Zoloft as well so who knows but I find with medications with 'weight gain' as a side effect just trying your hardest to eat a well balanced diet will prevent it. It's too easy to give up and say oh well I'm gonna get fat - - it's very much not the case.

And to this day approx four years I thank myself, I didn't.. yes its heavy handed. But now I have nearly no racing thoughts, which drove me to suicidal tendancies, my mind never stopped it was like a TV on in the back ground.

Most of the time this medication helps me out.",0,8
Quetiapine,"I am bipolar 1, and take 400mg per day of quetiapine XR. I take this in combination with 200mg of lamotrigine. This combination is highly effective. The XR version of quetiapine is far superior to the immediate release version. Side effects are lessened with XR. There is some weight gain I am experiencing however I am controling, and even losing the weight, with a strict diet and daily, strenuous exercise with weights. If you do not exercise and eat right on this medication there is a strong chance there will be very noticeable weight gain. That said, quetiapine XR is highly effective at stopping acute mania (in larger doses), and maintaining a baseline mood at my current dosage. I recommend trying this medication for controlling mania",8,3

So I increased the Quetiapine again to 100mg (made up of 25mg tablets) and I've had what I can only describe as increase effects. Does that even exist? Cold feelings from flight or flight anxiety and agitated feelings.",10,2
Quetiapine,UK- My Psychiatrist diagnosed Bipolar coming from BPD.  So was already on 200mg per day.   He wanted me to increase the dose for it to have any impact on mood.  200mg is nothing for a Bipolar illness.  Took a 300mg 9pm and woke up at 5 pm the next day!!   Seeing as I work I doubt this will be the drug for me especially as I am going up to 600mg.,5,1

This medication definitely has side effects. Its a tranquilizer. It makes you very tired. It also made me gain a significant amount of weight...but I would rather deal with the side effects then deal with the horrible anxiety I was living with everyday.

I have suicidal thoughts throughout the day but I don't share that with my Dr because I don't want to get put in a hospital so I keep that to myself. I'm extremely depressed and it doesn't help me sleep. I can't sleep because of the thoughts going crazy in my head. So I have to take ambien.  I'm sick of all these medications.

I gained 40 pounds in 2 months just with 250mg. It's the worst medication of its category. I was on Zyprexa before but besides the horrible weight gain at least I was doing much better. I hate this medication. Do not take it people. It makes you fat doesn't help at all. No man just NOOO. I'm going back to Paxil 30mg and Zyprexa 7.5 mg which work so much better. Bye SEROQUEL.,0,11

I do have a few side effects from this medicine which include dry mouth, constipation and indigestion. I take seroquel for Borderline personality disorder (BPD), I am also on 300mg lithium and 300mg 3x a day of gabapentin.

However, it does give some weird side effects. It gives me intensely vivid dreams. I normally dream very little, but this gives me very strange dreams every night that I can very clearly remember on waking up. These dreams even frequently (3/4 times a week) cause me to wake up in the middle of the night! Would not recommend if you already have frequent nightmares or night terrors, as seroquel may make those much worse. Ineffective for depression.",0,33

Twitter and news used to upset me and I'd get ampted up about stories, but that's gone away mostly. Now I can react to things that used to make me furious with a laugh or just a short discussion with someone. Seroquel's not perfect, but the weirdness and intensity I used to experience has gone. It also helps greatly with my IBSd. I haven't had any weight gain, but my diet is low-fat and limited. Seroquel is MUCH better than TCAs btw. Good luck!",0,34

Anyway what I'm saying is I've tried a lot prescribed a lot and have to admit until 3 years ago when I started a new anxiety med and seeing a Dr who I didn't have to keep explaining often wrongly. So sertraline started making me clearer in thought and helped my recovery to start. I begged the dr to look at the cycles too look at the patterns of highs lows. And finally I was put on quintiapine!

He switched to Risperdal because the Seroquel was sedating when ingesting over 50mg and he needed doses during the day. Our daughter is on an average of 500mg a day with no sedating effects whatsoever and we're wondering if she just does not do well on this class of drug since 600mg a day is the highest she can safely go for her age.

This gave me a calm,  sleepy feeling that would put me to sleep for bed and would last until roughly 5pm the next day.  But when I upped the dose to 37.2mg I had a really bad asthma attack, heart pounding and my ears rang which lasted 2 weeks after I discontinued the med.

But has changed my life stopped the agitation and horrible thoughts that run riot in my head. Just slows it done and I am able to see clearly. I am only on a mild dose but in saying this I'm glad I take one when I can feel my mania coming on.,0,34
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel XR (quetiapine):</b>			 Not bad, but the weight gain and how tired it made me, eventually led me to go off of it.",0,20
Quetiapine,"I am a 36 year mother of one who has been married for 21 years to a wonderful man who endured years of my manic episodes, anger problems, hateful behavior. I knew that certain mental illnesses ran in my family, and they all started in the late twenties to early thirties. I ignored my symptoms for a long time, and doctors tried other medications. Mostly I would just try to get through the day without screaming at people. I was self- destructive and it was ruining my marriage. My new doctor put me on this medicine at 200 mg a day and it has changed my life. I feel like my old self, none of those terrible highs and lows. I am depressed/ bi-polar. I'm so thankful for this medication, and so is my husband and daughter!",10,7
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel XR (quetiapine):</b>			 For years I took seroquel in various doses throughout the given day. I was prescribed Seroquel XR about 3 years ago for Anxiety and Bipolar l. Since then it has been very effective.  I did not gain weight at all. The only drawback is it does cause dizziness and sleepiness.  Therefore,  I sometimes opt to take it later than prescribed 7:30pm instead of 6.",0,25
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel XR (quetiapine):</b>			 At first I hated this medication, made me really tired, feelings of non reality and weight gain. The doctor who put me on it said to wait and give it a chance. I'm glad I did. I use it to sleep at night, at some point I will reduce it but it's great for now. I have very restful sleeps, but am unable to remember my dreams. I am bipolar and although I am on other medication for it, I believe that Seroquel has been key in my mood stability. I take 100 mg every night, and 25 mg PRN for anxiety if needed. Although I get tired on it, it does slow down my thoughts.",0,22
Quetiapine,"I can honestly say this medication saved my life. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II when I was 16 and was in a very dark place that I didn't think I would ever be able to come out of. After a couple months of taking Quetiapine I noticed a dramatic change in my moods - I was a good 85% more stable than I had been in the previous 3-4 years and it also majorly helped my insomnia. Although after being on the medication for a year I did have to re-adjust my dose and put it higher, it's still working amazingly. Obviously it's not a cure, I still have some bad days! But I can move on from them within 24 hours without feeling like my world is falling apart. I'm 18 nearly 19 now and this is the happiest I've been in years.",10,7
Quetiapine,<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 I have been on Seroquel for 2 years.  It really is a miracle.  It has helped with my mood swings and problems sleeping.  The only issue has been the weight gain.  I've probably put on 35 lbs and I've never had problem with weight gain.  The benefits of this medication make up for the weight gain.,0,55
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 I've been on Seroquel for a couple months and I'm surprised at how good it works and how I have minimal side effects. I take 100mg-300mg at night and before my naps, just depending on how tired I already am without the medicine. Like most people, if you don't get ample sleep (8-10 hours), you usually wake up feeling tired &amp; groggy. It usually wears off within a couple hours though. I noticed when I take it my eyes become super red like I just finished smoking weed. I have experienced a little chest pain in my lower rib cage but it's tolerable. Other than that, I sleep like a baby; I have the vivid dreams which in my opinion is neither negative or positive. But it's helped in stabilizing my mood &amp; controlling my swings.",0,39
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel XR (quetiapine):</b>			 I was recently diagnosed with bipolar and began taking 25-50mgs a night to aid insomnia because at the time I felt relatively well. I appear to be one of the few to embrace the side effect of increased appetite, when I'm manic, depressed or even the slightest bit anxious my appetite disappears. I can go weeks without feeling the need to eat and I love eating! I used to smoke alot of pot to help with my appetite and racing thoughts. I'm now taking 150mg XR at night as I'm currently having a mixed episode. It helps quieten my mind and slows me down a little but I don't feel in any way zombified, at night soon after taking I get sleepy but that's about it!",0,22
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 I have been taking Seraquel for 10 years of varying dosage until finding the right balance of this medication.  It cured my insomnia and dampened the racingthoughts. Very happy with it for those reasons.  However. I feel very dizzy and tired around an hour after taking 350mg at night.  It levels out the mood swings.  Curbs  feelings of elation and empathy. Which is quite a price  to pay for steady moods. To conclude, Seraquel has had a very positive influence in the treatment of Bipolar Disorder. I think of it as preventative medication that quietens the mind. (Hence Quetiapine - it's pharmaceutical name).",0,29
Quetiapine,"I've been on Seroquel for 10 years and before I started this medication I was self destructive to myself, very bad episodes going up and down manic episides and I couldnt sleep without myself thinking about everything and worrying all the time but now since I've been on it.

Quetiapine,"I truly think this medication may have saved my life. I'm 24, and I knew I had some mental issues since I was a teen. Until now I never took them seriously, but looking back.. I'm so glad I was diagnosed and treated with this medication. I suffered for so many years with little sleep, alcoholism, panick attacks, mood swings, ludacris spending... you name it.

I've gained 40kg in 7 years though and I'm now trialling alterntives. I had a severe allergic reaction to Saphris, but it did everything that Seroquel did and more. I'm now looking into Zeldox or Latuda.",0,21

I take 50mg at night and sleep like a baby. Make sure to get 8-10 hours of sleep/night and you won't feel drowsy the next morning. It's eliminated my anxiety entirely and I feel completely stabilized. I haven't had any trouble with weight gain; in fact, I've already lost a few lbs, due to the fact that I no longer feel emotionally-driven to binge eat. No side effects as far as I can tell. An ABSOLUTE MIRACLE DRUG. Just praying the results hold up.",0,78
Quetiapine,"This medicine has really helped with my bipolar. I take 300mg (slow release) every evening and it's really helped balance my moods and ease any depressive episodes. Only side effect is feeling like a zombie if I wake up too early, but it's all about taking the pill at the right time before you sleep. If anything I'm getting the best sleep I've ever had when taken properly.",10,18

If this is how it's going to affect my days each morning I can't wait. Just to be the normal me again. No weight gain as of yet but being a size 6 in clothes I'm looking forward to gaining. Hopefully on the long run this medication will help my relationship with my partner and 3 beautiful kids.,7,21
Quetiapine,"I've been taking quetiapine for bipolar for years and it has changed my life. I can concentrate more and it helps me to think clearly. I take it in conjunction with the anti-depressant amitriptyline. They 'iron things out' so that my moods are easier to cope with. That isn't to say it has 'cured' me, but they have improved my condition greatly.",10,14
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 At first, it was horrible. I felt like I was dying every time I would take it before bed, I felt as if I were to fall asleep I'd never wake up. This lasted 2 weeks maybe a month.... My body eventually adjusted to it, the voices went away. Slowly, but surely. I was also in a serious state of depression, and it takes some time but now after a little over a year of taking it, being bipolar and having countless manic and depressive episodes, Seroquel has saved my life. I've never felt like myself like I do right now in such a long time. The only dumbs down is you have to seriously monitor your weight on this thing, the pounds just pile up if you don't watch your weight carefully..",0,83
Quetiapine,<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 I love Seroquel but not the XR type. Helps you to sleep well at night and wake up feeling great. Gives you major munchies at night and woke up with Reeses Pieces all over the bed.  Does help with a lot on highs and lows. So for me it's worth a little weight gain.  Overall this medicine has changed my life.,0,100
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 Seroquel has worked wonders for me.  I have been diagnosed with Bipolar 2, and after 7 months on Seroquel, I feel like a whole new person.  I had been severely depressed and was self harming before getting on Seroquel, and now I have never been so happy before!  The only problem is the weight gain - I have gained about 20 pounds since I started taking this medicine.  But this side effect is worth it to have my depression and anxiety gone!",0,80
Quetiapine,<b>Seroquel XR (quetiapine):</b>			 Great medication helps with bi-polar. If I had anything bad to say it would be that it makes you gain weight like crazy. However other then that I sleep better then I have in twenty some years.,0,24

I had side effects of a type of floating- my head wasn't attached to my body- I'd be disorientated, only for a short time, but frequently at first. I don't really remember any other side effect.  I wanted to stop taking this. I was 300 SR then went to normal Seroquel.  Being on standard Seroquel helped.  I asked to change off Seroquel and was told its a good medicine and just give it time- 6 weeks. Wow, I didn't like that idea.  I did give it time,  I was tried of a day, so went back to 150mg- over time I've been on 200mg also and now 300mg.  I am so grateful to myself for hanging in there.

At first I just thought I was in a normal phase (not manic or depressive) - but the depressions usually sneaks up on me after a few weeks when I've felt normal before. Not had any side-effects, other than restless legs syndrome, but I've had that before, so it wasn't a biggie. This side-effect has also almost disappeared after a few months. Was so scared of weight gain, but I watched what I eat, and work out a lot, instead I've gotten skinnier and healthier. Thumbs up! I got my life back!",0,113
Quetiapine,"This medication has truly saved my life! I have Bipolar 1 and would predominantly suffer from intense periods of mania, lasting up to 6 months. I was completely reckless  and out of control in every way. Depression was less common but whenever it hit, I would attempt suicide and have done so three times in my life. However since taking quetapine, I became nearly instantly stable and I am now in Law School. No weight gain at all, not a single pound! However I cant loose weight either. I'm on 200mg daily at the moment.",10,16
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel XR (quetiapine):</b>			 Seroquel XR has changed my life! I tried regular Seroquel and it's like having your head in a bucket. The XL version feels like a completely different medicine. I take 100 mg at night. I wake up refreshed, happy, eager to start my day, I also take Lamictal 300 mg in the morning. No side effects from either medicine. I have been on both for about 7 years. I have been depressed once in that time and it was situational.",0,39
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 I've been taking Seroquel for 7 years, after 20 years of delusional thoughts, mania, and large amounts of depression. It worked within two weeks and I noticed that when I woke up each day that my delusional thoughts were getting easier to identify and let go of. It changed my life. Since taking Seroquel, I have been able to learn how to drive, work in permanent jobs, save money, travel overseas, socialise, have a successful relationship and reconnect with the real me. I have also worked on my cognitive and emotional development and continue to attend counselling. I have gained 30kgs, but this has probably come about due to the combination of Seroquel, inactivity, diet and Sleep Apnea (of which I have only just been diagnosed).",0,75

I didn't want to stay on it, but was advised to give it longer. And to change from XR to regular.  I did,  and after about 6 weeks (from memory) I adjusted to it.  Yes, I was so tired, went to cut a 300mg into halves, then to 200mg's, now to 300 mg again.  Seroquel works for me, I've been on it for approx 18mnths or so.

Currently taking 300mg as needed as it was mainly prescribed for sleep. It is as effective as benzodiazepines in that regard, without the benzo withdrawal. It does leave me feeling gritty and nasty the next morning though, but it's better than insomnia.",0,43
Quetiapine,Removed my mania symptoms and I've never felt like I'm going back to the highs. Helped with depression but this is along side vigorous exercise. Take it at night 250mg and I sleep all night. Unfortunately the biggest side effect I have is extreme tiredness the next morning and it can last a few hours. It feels like a minor hangover each day.,7,4
Quetiapine,It helps me feel calm and be able to sleep.  I have a tendency to stay up too late at night  and when I do my legs get restless and I have to go to bed and I sleep well.  I have occasional abnormal dreams and a small problem emptying my bladder completely.  All in all though it is improving my life.  I also take Strattera and Lamotrigine.,8,4

I have had a diagnosis of depression for about ten years and was using Cipralex (Lexapro). I came off Cipralex twice, and both times I became very depressed.  Even on Cipralex my mood was constantly changing so I went to see a psychiatrist who thinks I may have Cyclothymia or bipolar 2 so started me on 50mg of Seroquel.  Initially I was very groggy but have gotten over that. I've also gained a stone in weight. But my mood has really stabilised for the first time. I feel happy,  confident and passionate.

No drive or motivation whatsoever.  My doctor thinks I should stay on this poison.  I am going on a vacation in a couple months, this 40lb weight gain is really stressing me out.  I will see if she will prescribe Adderall which I used before quit cold turkey and felt no withdrawals. The only reason I give it a 2 is that it has helped insomnia",2,6

Since being on this medication my Tourette's is manageable and I have not been in the hospital since.  I am stable as long as I am compliant.  I have experienced weight gain but I have reevaluated my diet and started an exercise program in which I am down to my goal weight and keeping it there.

If looks could kill I would be guilty of numerous killings. I am able to be in situations that are less than desirable without offending anyone.

A good first medicine to try, because it's a mood stabilizer (for both types of episodes), anti-psychotic, sleep medication, and anxiolytic!

I had taken it before, but my other doctor left and every other doctor wanted to put me on Lithium but I said no because I have Lupus.

After a year of unsuccessful treatment with other medicines, I begged to be put back on the Seroquel because the depression was unbearable, and I wasn't responding to other medicines.

Like I said I have my life back, something I was told would never happen. Seroquel XR is that reason for that. Regular Seroquel is great too it just made me sleep for 18 hours a day.

About an hour after taking Seroquel the restless legs subside and I am sleepy enough to get a good night's sleep.  I am prescribed benztropine (Cogentin) for the restless legs and it helps some.  After I take my medicine I do not drive until the next day as there is risk of an accident and getting a DUI.

Used to take 300mg a day, but now I only need 100mg, or 150-200mg on bad days.  This was the only medicine that did not cause tremors or restless legs.

My doctor increased it to 60 mg because it's closer to the therapeutic dose. That was too much for me. I was jittery, couldn't sit still, felt like a racing in my chest, it was a strange sensation. But when I went back down to 40mg, I was fine, and it's enough to treat my mood. If you're like me be careful of taking too much and find a doctor who is willing to listen about lowering doses.

Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I was diagnosed 15 years ago for bipolar I disorder. I was put on a very high dose of lamotrigine (450 mg) and lithium (1500-1800 mg). My memory was decimated and my thinking was dulled and I had other cognitive issues including ability to concentrate and pay attention. After 14 years on this regime, I sought another doctor's opinion. He cross-tapered Latuda (dosing up to 60 mg), and lowered the lithium from 1800 mg to zero! We did this over 6 months, very gradually. I am eternally grateful to my doctor. My mind became free again and most of my cognitive problems either diminished or went away entirely. What a great, life-changing decision. I wish you well on your path to healing. Never give up!!",0,33

I did however have issues with the side effects of  it knocking me out, tremors and muscle stiffness. The fact that it makes me want to sleep all day makes me very depressed.

I started out on 20 mgs then after two weeks went to 40 mg. Right at the three week mark thats when I started to have extreme panic attacks, restlessness, and I felt out of my mind. I already suffer from hypomania, disassociation, and anxiety, and this medication exponentially increased it. I felt out of my mind and decided to quit cold turkey, which is kind of disheartening because I was desperate for a pill that would work for my severe depression and hypomania. Everything was intensified to the point. Voices in my head, panic attacks, anxiety over everything, and a complete loss of time and space. I wouldnt recommend this drug to anyone with preexisting anxiety disorders.",0,21

The only downsides are the side effects. I have pretty bad social anxiety and in the beginning I was so exhausted but now that has gone away, clenching of the jaw/teeth, shaky hands/head, I overheat.

I only lost a few pounds after the switch to 80mg of Latuda. So, my Doctor and I worked on a trial and error program with a combination of drugs. Here's what's working for me as of now: 20mg of Latuda (makes me drowsy and that's about it...so I take it at night), 400mg of Lamotrigine (can't think of any side-effects), and 0.5mg of Xanax every night. I've always had trouble sleeping so the combo of Latuda and Xanax takes care of that. The Xanax also helps with the anxiety I've always had, the Lamotrigine keeps the mania and some of the depression away, and the Latuda seems to take the rest of the depression away. I've been stable with this combination and lost another 11 lbs. The biggest downside-besides cost- is the drowsiness I have during the day. A 20 min nap helps with that.",0,14

The restlessness was unbearable, tried different beds, couch, different positions, baths, I had this incredibly strong energy that was dying to explode in every part of my body.

It does kill any libido I had.  No changes in weight.  Restless legs though if I take it to early before bed, so I take as close to bedtime as possible to sleep through it.

The restlessness, pacing, severe insomnia, heart palpations, etc. I had slept 10 hours in a two week period and felt like I was crawling out of my skin while thinking really dark thought. I immediately started tapering my dose and saw the doctor on day three of withdrawal. She prescribed benztropine once a day and hydroxyzine three times day as needed.

It is one of the very few antipsychotics that I don't feel chemically lobotimized on. Only problem is about 3 months in I started developing akathisia and it was interfering with my sleep, so I had to be taken off of it.

I finally tapered off, which was extremely difficult.  It has been 6 months since Ive stopped taking it and I am still having some side effects! Please do your research before taking this medication! Its absolutely not worth losing your mind.  The long term side effects are still unknown. Im still trying to heal.

The downsides include horrible, daily, all-day nausea. It is not controlled by Zofran. In the beginning, I would throw up unexpectedly--that has stopped.  I do clench my jaw terribly and have very slight weird tongue movements. The tongue movements are pretty much controlled by taking benadryl at night with the Latuda.

If you know what restless leg syndrome is like, just imagine it for your entire body AND your brain, all-day every day. I was miserable. I couldn't be out socially because it made me feel trapped and out of control to the point where I felt paralyzed by it all. I couldn't be at home by myself because it was all I could focus on.

This isn't just mania, this has been a long-term change.   It makes me super hungry and I crave food all the time, but not as much as some of the other antipsychotics.  I'm actually getting bariatric surgery just so I can hopefully finally beat antipsychotic weight gain. However, the 40mg dose I take initially made me incredibly sick when I took it.

No physical side-effects, only terrible emotional effects.  I had extreme anxiety, restlessness, irritability and intense anger... also increased suicide ideology.  I was completely out of character whilst on it and even felt loopy;  It took a week to realise it was the Latuda causing it.

I just hope the tardive dyskinesia which became apparent when it was lowered to 80mg will not be permanent.  I have been on about 6 or so different antipsychotics and they all made me exhausted.

The screaming helped, the self-injury didn't. Because I was already taking Inderal, my psychiatrist tried adding L-DOPA. It didn't help. Finally I weaned off the Latuda. The restlessness and leg movements went away within 2 months. Three years later I still can't break the finger-twiddling habit. Trying to stop brings triggers restlessness. I also have an internal monologue of thoughts that started when I stopped Latuda. Unchecked, it causes me to gesture and make facial expressions.

After that, my doctor took me off it,I still continued vomiting for another week. I had to go on a soft diet and still had stomach pain. I underwent an endoscopy, and several small ulcers and erosion was found in my stomach. My gastroenterologist believed that this may have been caused by the Latuda, as I did not have this problem before. To top it off, it's very expensive, even with insurance. I would not recommend.",0,10

It didn't help my impulse/rage, so the third month I was bumped to 40mg. 3 days later, a hour after taking my 40mg, I had the biggest panic attack in my life! I wasn't able to take care of myself let alone my daughter. My S/O had to leave work early to come home.  I called the Dr but had to leave a message.  I debated going to the ER but I read online to try Benadryl. After 4hrs of panic and not being able to function, the Benadryl calmed me down. When the Dr called back, she told me to go back to 20mgs.

But its rather tolerable. My Dr told me there's a trick. Take it after dinner.  After a couple days I have begun to get terrible restless leg syndrome. Talked to my Dr and he put me on klonopin to take 1 hour after latuda. Last night it didn't work.  Overall, my mood is still wishy washy. I am however getting up and doing more.

I even started to not hibernate in my room and  I interact with my child and my newborn again. I feel like I'm getting my life back. I've tried prozac, but it didn't help my racing thoughts, and wanting to commit suicide. This does have side effects of course.

Latuda is also great at stabilizing my mood and no weight gain, but it makes me terribly sick. I'm very nauseous even when I have food in my stomach-sometimes to the point I'm sure I'm going to vomit. It even makes my teeth hurt initially.

Lurasidone,<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I have been taking Latuda 40mg for nearly 1 month now. Diagnosed Bipolar II since I was in my mid forties. I am now 65 years old. So far this medication has been very effective. No depression for 3 weeks. No hypomania so far. Seroquel worked fairly well but not as well as Latuda. I have lost a few pounds since I started Latuda. I have recieved some samples and will purchase this drug from Canada due to the outrageous cost here in the USA. My Medicare copay is $450.00. In Canada I can get a 30 day supply for about $180.00. Otherwise I would have to take something else and likely much less effective. Latuda is a great medication for me but it is truly incredible and in a way evil that 30 tablets retails for $1200!,0,19

It has done nothing for my depression the past two months and I have had anxiety and major irritability on it.  The nausea and vomiting is miserable.  I was prescribed zofran to offset the nausea but that is not so helpful either since the zofran causes constipation.

Lurasidone,<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I initially went on it for depression. It worked great. But years had passed and everyday was the same I was never moving forward. I was forgetting a lot of things. I'm in my 30s I felt as if I was in my 70s when it came to memory. The ability to converse normally decreased over time. I would forget at-least 2 words every few sentences and I would forget obligations and functions.

Latuda seemed promising as it has less metabolic side effects than other atypical antipsychotics. However, Latuda immediately gave me severe anxiety (which added klonopin to my daily regiment). Towards the end of the 4-5 months, I began developing recurring and intense dark thoughts immediately after increasing my Latuda dosage. I instantly took myself off of the drug and am searching for a new atypical antipsychotic to fill its place. I know that Latuda has worked very well for some, but I want to add a warning that it can cause severe anxiety. Monitor your symptoms carefully with your doctor.",0,23
Lurasidone,"I had high hopes for Latuda for my depression. After my 1st dose, my anhedonia was immediately relieved and I could FEEL. It was amazing... It also quieted the chaos in my head, smothered out my anxiety/panic, and I was happy. After my 2nd dose of 10mgs, I had no desire to speak or move. I wasn't tired, I was just completely blank. But, I didn't feel anxious, so I took my 3rd dose, and the following day, I began experiencing intense, excruciating pain in every muscle in my body, and all of my muscles were very tense. I have myofascial pain syndrome, but I never felt pain to that extent in my life. 4th and 5th doses, no change, and I just couldn't take the pain anymore....

I took Latuda at 5 PM and the next day I was feeling noticeably better. On my 3rd day and I feel better than yesterday. If all goes well, this could be a miracle drug for me, even though it's too soon to know. It's been months after a mania episode that I've wind-down to a depressed state, that is not severe but has been constant, where I can't even remember the path to a thought pattern that isn't guilty, hopeless, or without pleasure.

The naps I would take after taking the pill when at home were not fully rested, I would get chills, had to have layers of blankets for 3-4 hours.

Initially as my doctor had me titrating up I experienced some TD at night, but that soon abated. Now, at 80 mg nightly, I still rely on this medication to keep me functional.

I feel good every day, if not really good/great. I have energy, but not manic/frenzied/restless. Good mood for me always carried the additional symptom of manic/tormenting agitation.

I was sweating and hyperventilating and felt a constant choking sensation I think from panicking. This is my experience it may be someone else's miracle drug. It did ease the depression and mood swings but the side effects were not worth it. On the plus side I gave it a 3 because I was never hungry and dropped 20 pounds.,0,24

However, it controls my symptoms so well that I won't stop taking it.  It is the only medication in its class that works for me.  I miss sleeping well, but the benefits outweigh the risks for me.

Ever since I've been on this I feel like I did when I was a kid very free and level, no crazy obsessive thoughts or cravings.

She tapered me down to 20mg for a week and was supposed to stop after that. After reducing down to 20mg the intrusive thoughts returned. I went back to my old ways of blockading my front door out of fear of an intruder, and not leaving my apt at night (zero rational reasoning for my actions). Called my dr and went back up to 40mg as of today. Will not be quitting.",0,37
Lurasidone,<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 After being on seroquel and then shortly zyprexa I was put on latuda 40 mg. It gave me a lot of anxiety and strong restless feelings so I dropped to 20 mg and it helped. I've since gone back up to 40 mg because 20 wasn't helping all my symptoms. It helps a lot with suicidal thoughts and negative obsessive thoughts and I've noticed I've lost weight on it. The anxiety can be kinda unbearable at times but in the overall scheme it seems to be worth it. I would go up to a higher dose but my insurance won't cover it. I take it at night with something to eat and if I do have uncomfortable feelings they go away within a couple hours. Overall I would say it's a pretty good med but be careful because it is pretty potent even at low doses.,0,30

Folks, Doctors NEED to be using SCIENCE to treat illnesses, not giving out random prescriptions for 2+ medications for 1 illness. If your Doctor is not doing monthly blood tests AT LEAST to see how the medications are affecting your body chemistry and serotonin levels, then you need to fire the Doctor and find one who does do his/her job the right way, and who is good at the science part of the job. Every medication you take counteracts and interacts with the other medications and the foods and other things that you put into your body each day messing with the chemistry of your body",0,22
Lurasidone,<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I have type 2 BP along with many other things and I do say I love this RX. It helped me out for a very long time one of the first and few. However I did feel very dulled emotionally. I was on 140mg daily but any does lower did not work. I could not even cry unless something absolutely tragic (Ie. Death or someone I loved getting hurt) happened in my life. Also I hated having to take it with food. I constantly had an upset stomach as I could never seem to get eating and taking the med right. So all in all I took myself off from the med and the withdrawls from it were hell. For about two weeks I felt like I was dying. So as a conclusion; this med does work and work well if you like being a robot who vomits.,0,22

They tend to make my eyes roll back I can bring them down to look at you but then they stay stuck up. Not even Cogentin helps. I am so excited because this has not happened with the Latuda yet. I am down 6.4 pounds. And I feel great. My appetite is very curb. Unfortunately my first week I had a lot of anxiety. And one very bad day. But all of that has seemed to subside. My stomach has been upset... But I'm willing to take the bad... Because I'm getting so much good,0,32
Lurasidone,"My psych prescribed Latuda because my SSRI wasn't working all that well. The Latuda helped me level out, calm down, and finally feel somewhat normal after a long time. Serious side effect for me, though:  Dry eyes.  I am somewhat prone to dry eye syndrome anyway, but it was under control.  When I started on the Latuda, it really, really flared up.  The dry eyes caused me so much anxiety and discomfort that we decided that I would stop the Latuda to see if that would help my eyes.  The dry eye syndrome has all but gone away again. Sigh....   Latuda is not, of course, primarily an anti-depressant, so my psych, eye doctor, and I decided we would try something else for the depression, because there are more options than for dry eye.",6,1
Lurasidone,"Latuda has been amazing for my anxiety. It helps calm my mind and slows down my racing thoughts. Since starting it, that part of my mental health has been almost completely resolved. I still take other medications for depression, as Latuda helped for a little while in that area, but I slipped into another Major Depressive Episode while on it. As far as racing anxious thoughts go though, they're nonexistent for me at this point (after being my main mental health issue for ten years). I had some side effects in the beginning (nausea after taking it, not wanting to eat for a while, and a little bit of restlessness), but all of those resolved within a month or so.

Anxiety about 60% which is why I'm looking to up my dosage to 40mg along with upping my zoloft dosage to 100mg.But with any medicine there are side effects and diarrhea is an issue with this medication.

So in an effort to loose weight and the bad side effects I switched to Latuda.  Lutuda didn't do squat for me in the sleep department, so I ended up taking a half pill of Seroquel and a dose of Latuda.  This worked well for about a year.  I lost a ton of weight and my overall health improved.  However, I slipped into a major depressive episode in less than a year and had to go back to the tried and true Seroquel.

Right now, I am tapering off of it and feeling more miserable and incapacitated than I have in my entire life. It's horrible. I feel like I don't know what to do with myself. The voice in my head is relentless. This medication made me worse, and my psych and I had very high hopes for it. I couldn't sleep on it as well. I wanted to stick it out to see if a higher does would work for me but decided that the depression I'm experiencing now is much too intense to push on through. I'm going to see her ASAP after the holidays and ask to be put on Lactimal. Maybe this will work for you, but it was not my niche.

Fortunately my Bipolar 1 and Schizoaffective Disorder were held in check. I don't know how. My sleep has now come back due to 100mg of Seroquel. Albeit I can not fall asleep without it. The worst lingering side effect has been with my tongue. It is constantly pushed up against the roof of my mouth! It never ends. I also constantly grind and clench my teeth. This has been the worst experience with any medication I have been on. I am also on 900mg of Lithium and 300mg of Lamictal.,0,50

Lurasidone,<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I've been on Latuda for about 6 weeks for Bipolar depression. It is one of the most effective medications that I have taken for depression but I'm dealing with a few side effects that I hope will go away. I have the paradox of extreme tiredness followed by difficulty sleeping. If I take it during the day I will have a few hours of fighting falling asleep. When I take it at night (which is what I do now) after the initial sleepiness wears off I wake up several times and am somewhat restless. Hopefully I will be able to adjust better over time. If you need something that works fast for depression I would recommend.,0,86

The best thing about the Latuda was the significant decrease in my appetite, but that could have been an effect of removing Seroquel from my regimen. When I first started I had a very hard time sleeping due to restlessness but that went away with time. The main issues I had with Latuda were a feeling of numbness to the world around me (no desire to do anything or say anything), a definite decrease in my sex drive, and the cost.

I am very pleased with Latuda.",0,117
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I've had mostly positives with it. I do have some difficulty moving quickly at the gym because it causes dizziness, but this is a small inconvenience.

However, it abated a bit after the first few days, and by a week it is not bad I have gained some weight, but I think it's because I've been eating/taking Latuda later at night.

I also tire a little more upon exertion, but not too much. I feel slightly shaky, but even that has improved. In the beginning I had slightly restless sleep, but now have great sleep, with pleasant dreams. I feel normal, calm, happy and stable. I have NEVER felt this way. Definitely not manic at all.

I have more energy, eat less, fog like state of not fully being there is gone. I feel like a different person. The first week was nauseating but that went away and lasted a half hour at a time.

The result has been miraculous.  Within a week of starting, all negative feelings were gone.  I experience nausea when I take it, but that is a small price to pay for such a major shift in my well-being.  My appetite remains normal, and I've lost 5 pounds since starting Latuda because I have motivation to exercise again.  Highly recommended to anyone who is BP II and wants to break out of depression.",0,191

My sleeping is still not as good as it should be however even with the 25 mg of Seroquel which I sleep very poorly without. I also take Lorazepam as needed for anxiety.

I still have my normal social anxieties and that's something I have to face; not a pill. If you are crying out of control, major mood swings, tired, depressed, then Latuda will help you.

Lurasidone,<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I've been on 20mg Latuda for about 1 month. So far it has changed my life. I've had NO side effects. I was worried about weight gain but none at all. I am eating more nutritionally and wanting to take better care of myself. I have struggled brutally with bipolar depression and attempted suicide several times not really wanting to die but to stop the horrific depression. I guess now there's a reason I'm still here. I hope I'm not being too premature in thinking this might last. But for now I'm taking it one day at a time and enjoying the moment. Best medication I've ever had so far. THANK YOU to whoever invented this!,0,137
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 Before Latuda, I had become scared. thought everyone was lying to me. I had become violent, screaming, crying for long periods, sitting in the dark for hours, staying home. I started on 40mg daily. I noticed within 2 days I was thinking clearer and feeling less anxious. I was still having meltdowns about every three days, so we went to 80mg six weeks ago. I have been much happier, more productive and sleeping better. I take it at night. The worst side effect I had was swelling around my ankles. But that went away. I'm losing weight. No longer eat in my sleep. It hasn't fixed all, but it has me on the right track to trying to get well. Before Latuda, I didn't care about getting well. I Hope and pray it keeps working.",0,98

I was on was Lexapro for depressrion for quite sometime that seems to run its course with me. Oh was diagnosed with MS in 1992 so add that piece to the puzzel.As far as Latuda,  I have mixed feelings. It seems to help me with focus and cognitive deficiencies, which I could be MS related.  Depression is there but not as it was, but I still cry and at times stay in my head too long.  I seem to be more agitated with my children.  Ativan helps with Anxiety when needed. I will be seeing my psych tomorrow to discuss.",0,37

Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I've only been on Latuda for a week, what a difference it has made in my mood. It has lifted the depression &amp; debilitating anxiety. I take it along with Depakote &amp; Klonopin (both of which I've been on for many years). I take it at night because it makes me sleepy. It does give me a lump in the throat sensation, for some reason, about an hour and 1/2 after I take it and that feeling lasts about 2-3 hours.  The next day it's gone.  I will talk with my psych PA about it, to see what it may be.  I haven't had this much motivation in a very long time, and it's not a manic or hypomanic feeling, I just feel like living again.  I hope it continues to work well and doesn't cause any intolerable side effects.",0,90
Lurasidone,<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 So my experience with this medication is a good one.  I have tried just about everything for bipolar with schizoeffective features but this is the only thing that seems to keep me out of the hospital.  I don't overeat on this medication and I don't have hardly any side effects. I am currently taking 80mg at night and I seem to be getting quality sleep and feeling as good as you can feel with bipolar disorder the next day.  I don't give it a 10 because I still have some unusual thoughts but I have yet to take a medication that can completely take care of them or I think they are also called intrusive thoughts. If you read this I hope your experience with this medication will be as good as mine.,0,87
Lurasidone,<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I have been taking Latuda 80 mg for 8 months and am on no other medications for medication induced bipolar disorder which was caused by antidepressants prescribed for anxiety.  Latuda should be taken with 350 calories but when I took the medicine with food I was completely engulfed in anxiety within an hour.  Now I take it at night with no food.  I sleep for 12 hours at night and feel pretty good but am easily irritated.  I had the genetic testing which indicated that I MAY be a rapid metabolizer of this medicine so I'm not sure if I am not getting enough of the medicine (because I am not taking it with food) and that is the cause of my irritability or if 80mg is causing irritability.,0,36

Lurasidone,<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I was on deep depression. Effexor was not working any more and was having deep suicidal thought. Then my doctor added Latuda 40 mg. Miracle! No more suicidal thought and my bipolar depression ceased by 80%. The only problem is make me sleep when I take in the morning and make me awake when I take it at supper. Taking it at lunch causes a little less sleepiness. Another feature is that it control my severe anxiety.,0,66
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I have Bipolar1 Disorder with history of psychotic features. I have just started taking 40 mg of Latuda per day, as I am being weened from 900 mg of lithium.  I was having so many adverse side effects, such as tremors, extreme dry mouth, weight gain and thyroid issues.  Additionally, it didn't seem to be working very well.  After a few days, I notice an amazing positive change in my mood, my appetite, and stability.  I am still on 800 mg. of Seroquel/day and 150 mg of Pristiq, but it all continues to go well, Seroquel will be the next to be reduced.  I am very optimistic, and have not felt this way in a long time.",0,65
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I have been taking Latuda for about three weeks now for bipolar II.  I don't suffer too badly from it, mostly slight depression and irritability. Started week one on 40 mg and was still slightly depressed but not cranky. Upped it to 80 mg and am feeling sunshiny again. Positive attitude is back, interest in things, no longer cranky, more focused, more outgoing. The only MAJOR problem is I am sleepy all the time! I tried taking it at dinner, bedtime, and lunch. I pass out out at 8:30 at night, can't get up in the morning and fight to stay awake at my desk at work. I have read lots of other posts that people have said it passes after a month or so, I really hope so because otherwise its a great med. No other side effects for me.",0,85
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 Struggled with undiagnosed bipolar disorder for 8 years. Finally got on the right cocktail with Latuda included. I'm at 60mg and it has stopped my cycling (I'm a rapid cycler). No side effects, except for weight loss and difficulty gaining it back (which may be great for some of you, but I'm a former anorexic so not so great on that front). Did not change my intake of food ... but the med definitely decreased my appetite. Would HIGHLY recommend giving this med a go.

Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I was diagnosed with Bi-Polar II after being told I had Depression for about 2 years. My doctor prescribed me WellButrin, which I am still on and love. Following, I was put on Prozac to take my edge off and I took it for 2 years but it gave me horrible nightmares and I am now off of it. My doctor then prescribed me Latuda. I have been on it for about 3-4 weeks and have loved it. Before I was diagnosed with type II I had no idea why I would be so upset one day but feel great with an abundance of energy the next day. It was my cycles. I cycle very frequently, however, the Latuda has helped me stay constant and stable. I don't get upset over stupid things anymore (and they were stupid) and now have a better capability of letting things go.",0,107
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I took this medicine while I was pregnant, it was difficult in the 1st 2 weeks. I had a lot of anxiety and I went to sleep really fast but after that the medicine worked perfectly and I was very happy with it.

Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I've been on Abilify seems forever. It did work well except for my sleep. So I began Latuda 4 weeks ago and so far my sleep is really improved and so has my moods. I haven't had any side effects except for the sexual one, which they all seem to take away from that. Highly recommend Latuda. Very expensive though.",0,82
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 Since starting on 80 mg Latuda along with Buproprion my Bi-Polar mood swings are at bay, I feel no social anxiety or awkwardness and am not fearful much like I used to be. I am more like the authentic self I was when I was younger before my diagnosis: outgoing, articulate, motivated, upbeat/hopeful, productive, stable &amp; high-functioning + energetic. I have been able to quit coffee, cigarettes &amp; carbs due to my new found motivation, will be transferring to a large University soon, function better under pressures of work &amp; motherhood &amp; find it much easier to maintain my 12 Step Recovery Program &amp; stay clean &amp; sober too! I would highly recommend Latuda for anyone lacking focus, drive or positive feelings to see if it effects you as profoundly.",0,142
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I took Latuda 40 mg for a week and then 80 the next week. I had to stop halfway through week 2 because I wasn't sleeping and I was feeling more agitated. Actually, it made my bipolar worse. I was up and down and up and down within a matter of minutes.",0,48
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 As far as I'm concerned it's a miracle medicine for bipolar. A week and a half ago I was so bad off that I didn't want to live. My mother called my shrink at about 6PM, he called in a prescription, and I took 20mg at around 7PM. When I woke up the next morning I felt fine, and I've pretty much been that way since. Some of it may be due to the placebo effect, but I don't think a whole lot because such a dramatic improvement has never occurred when I've started other medicines.",0,89

Last dose of Seroquel will be this Thursday. Taking Lithium, Lamictal (I like this one too), Topamax, several more psych meds as required, and asthma meds. Latuda is GREAT! My mood is slightly on the manic side, but sleep is perfect, so a little (safe) fun is just fine by me. Everybody around me has noticed the change. I'll let things settle for a couple months and ask the psych to drop the Topamax some (I think it messes with my memory at 300mg). So far no weight loss on the Latuda like the rest of you seem to have noticed, but the rest is so great, I'm all in.",0,61

I have no side effects, have finally been able to get on a normal sleep schedule, and haven't had any manic episodes.  I feel normal again!  I take 40mg at night.  I also take Celexa 40mg daily and 1mg Ativan as needed.  I also take a lot of vitamins.  I've been taking Latuda for 8 months.",0,62
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I love this medication because it has cleared my head and made me feel a lot more stable. I also take Luvox, Lamictal and Klonopin for Panic Disorder and insomnia. Even before going on Latuda, I was having severe insomnia but only at night. I have had problems with that all my life, however. The Klonopin helps me sleep during the day but not at night as it was doing. Despite the great effects of Latuda, I recently went off of it because for several hours after I take it, I am so restless I can't stop moving. Doc recommended Cogentin but I don't want to be on any more meds than necessary. However, after going off the Latuda, I went manic and then crashed. I think I may give it a go again, WITH the Cogentin this time. I have Bipolar 1.",0,42
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I have Bipolar 1 with psychotic features. Since being put on Latuda, my mood swings have lessened considerably, and I am no longer experiencing any psychotic symptoms. My doctor was so pleased with the improvements that he gave me the okay to go to college. I am in my first week of college, hours away from home and have never felt better. I experienced akathesia with Latuda, so my doctor prescribed Cogentin to combat that and it helps a lot. Overall, I would say Latuda has helped me get my life on track and my symptoms under control.",0,48
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 Some nausea, severe vomiting when I first began...better now. It knocks me out pretty quick, so I take it at night along with 300mg of Lamictal and 150mg of Trazodone. The worst side effect I've noticed is EXTREME fatigue. I can't seem to get enough sleep. Otherwise, its definitely a step in the right direction. 2 weeks and counting- If the fatigue thing doesn't let up I'll probably have to stop it and move on to something else (its that bad). Also curbs my appetite considerably.",0,45
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I haven't seen anyone else discuss this, but Latuda gave me A LOT of anxiety.  Within 2 hours after taking the medication I would be in full freak out mode.  Also, my lower legs felt tingly.  These issues tended to last anywhere from 2-7 hours after I took it (at 4pm).  I gave it a 3 because I think it was otherwise working for what I'd hoped. My irritability disappeared completely.  However, because of the side-effects I'm off and looking for something else. (I also take lithium and Lamictal).",0,43
Lurasidone,<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I have been on Latuda 40mg since January 2012. I was prescribed it to help me sleep because I suffer with a severe case of insomnia. I had tried many different types of medicines to help knock me out. My Dr had tried Saphris but I was experiencing all the severe side effects. So my Dr discontinued that medicine and started me on Latuda 40mg. The medicine worked very well with my mood swings and insomnia. It wasn't until the past couple weeks that I haven't been able to sleep anymore. So my Doctor decided to increase my dosage to 80mg. I'm on night one but its 4:30am and still not sleeping. I'm also on Depakote and Lexapro.,0,25
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I am honestly not sure how to rate this medication but I can relate my experience so far.  I have had no nausea, it does help me sleep better.  I was given the medication for bipolar.  I have been emotionally shut down for a long time and after 3 days it has opened up my emotions and I am not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing.  In February my husband died of an accidental cocaine overdose.  The only emotion I have felt since he died is anger.  Now I feel over whelmed with grief and I am just not sure how to deal with that.",0,42

Some muscle soreness, not sure if that's the Latuda. And feeling like I over heat easily. Overall the side effects are tolerable and some of them welcomed. It's the first mood stabilizer that I haven't had horrible side effects with. I actually feel like it's helping me function better.",0,52
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I was started at 40mg and got mild nausea but doing good mood wise.  Increased to 80mgs and starting getting physically sick within 20 minutes of taking it.  It would have made a good diet medicine for me, but that is not why I was on it.",0,22

Now, I'd like to get off the Lithium. I still have anxiety and irritability but now I can get ahold of myself and see reason and calm down on my own. I would highly recommend. It is expensive though.",0,43
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I take 40 mg of Latuda nightly with a titration dose of 25-75 mg Lamogotrine (Lamictal) for bipolar I. Within a day of taking it, my mood brightened, I was able to wake up in the morning without malaise, and experienced a loss of appetite. I much prefer this to Depakote and Wellbutrin. I was not compliant with the Depakote due to the side effects of a huge appetite and the fact that it made me feel like a zombie. After a manic episode, I needed to recommit to compliance again, but abruptly stopped taking Depakote and Risperdone (prescribed right after manic episode) due to side effects. After a couple of weeks of no medicines, the Latuda/Lamotrigine cocktail made life so much brighter.",0,51

Positives are that it makes me have almost no manic episodes and very few mood switches. It has also helped with my sleep. Before I was getting about 2-4 hours asleep at most each day. Now with the Latuda I sleep from about 9pm till 10am. The struggles I have with it are that it makes it very very hard to get up in the morning for school or whatever unless I get to sleep in until my body is ready. It has also made it very hard for me to eat. Since starting I have lost nearly 15 pounds. Other than that Latuda has made a huge impact on my life.

I take my Latuda in the evening. I've also noticed a huge drop in my sexual appetite and it definietly has suppressed my appetite. I don't eat much don't really have much of an appetite at all. I've started waking with a lot of muscle pain over the past week or so I see my Dr. again on the 16th and am going to ask him if this is usual which it seems to be from other people. I honestly like this medication more than most others I've been on and it's nice to lose the weight my old medications made me gain. I have a hard time waking up and usually sleep till about noon.,0,62
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I have had great experience so far with Latuda. I started taking 40 mg in Nov., and it worked great for about a week, then I crashed again. Dr. put it up to 80 mg and I've been great ever since. I'm afraid, though, because my sex drive has completely disappeared, and if it's the Latuda, I'm going to have to go off it-and I hate to go off something that's working so well. However, I'm also on a pretty high dose of Lexapro, and the Dr. thinks it's more likely to be a side effect of that, so we're decreasing that and hopefully that will work, because otherwise I'm feeling really good. I'm really afraid I'll have to go off it.",0,40
Lurasidone,"<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 I started Latuda about a month ago. Its hard to know if is truly working because I am trying to come off of 300 mg of Seroquel.

I have only cried 3 TIMES this week and I feel amazingly like my old self again.  I'm almost afraid its to good to be true and suddenly side effects are going to start.  But so far so good!  The only thing I've noticed is that I am eating again. I was having so much anxiety my food was choking me.  I am not gaining weight, just able to relax enough to eat.

The former two existed to some degree before I started Latuda, the latter is brand new.  Most noted side effect:  EXTREMELY sedating for 2-3 hours abruptly followed by intense restlessness, need to move.  Haven't figured out a good time of day to take it for this reason.

Lithium which I was on for 10 years began to rot my teeth because of dry mouth so I asked for a new medicine and the Doctor told me Latuda was brand new and is used primarily for schizophrenia but is used for Bipolar also. About 5 days into treatment I had experienced noticeable changes. They were a sense of calm without the tunnel vision and tiredness. I am a little more manic but not bad it's more like just being awake more not bouncing off the walls.

This risk is reduced by ramping up slowly. It took time to achieve a therapeutic dose. Lamictal is less effective when combined with hormonal birth control, so I take a higher dose.  Ive experienced depressive and hypomanic episodes on lamictal, but they were efficiently managed by increasing the dose or adding an antidepressant.

I do recommend it to people who are manic and unstable. It will help you get back on your feet and function in life. You will likely notice your mood is flatlined, but if your life is in the dumps then having a flatlined emotion is worth it.  You will not get upset over things that made you upset in the past.

Lamotrigine seemed to fix these issues. I am still depressed but it is nothing close to the agony I was in. It has laid the foundation, ADs often work for BP once an effective mood stabilizer has been found so I am augmenting. I am on 300mg lamotrigine and havent noticed many side effects besides from a bit of brain fog. The titration process is slow and a bit rough - My mood and mind went through some turbulence but things settle pretty quickly.

Lamotrigine,"I took lamotrigine for bipolar consistently for nearly two years and recently restarted it after accidentally taking a hiatus for 1.5 years (not advised, had a relapse). While the side effects were present at first (dizziness, drowsiness, headaches), they tended to go away within the first few weeks. Some people say meds make them feel groggy or not like themselves, but lamotrigine really levelled me out while allowing me to maintain my sense of self. I still dealt with occasional depressive periods, but the symptoms were much more mild and manageable than before. It was a game-changer in treating my bipolar disorder and made me feel alive again, which is why I was eager to restart it. I currently take 200mg and experience no symptoms. My best advice when trying this medication is to give it time, both to wait out the side effects and to allow it to fully kick in. Be patient, it's worth it!!",9,11

For the last 4 years I've not been able to control my depression, causing my personal and professional relationships to suffer drastically. 3 hours after my first dose I was able to confidently leave the house with a smile on my face. My manic reactions ceased day 1 and I have a clarity in my mind I remember from childhood.  It is too early for me to discuss any possible side effects other than less sleep, but going from 14 hours plus sleep a day to 6-8 most likely has a lot to do with it. Yesterday my car broke down on the side of the road on a hot Australian spring day and my anxiety was a complete non event. I wish I had this diagnosis and drug much sooner in my life. It has completely stopped any suicidal thoughts that used to plague me daily. I recommend anyone on the fence to break down your anxiety regarding seeing someone for help.

I have lost weight.. around 10 pounds which has never been easy for me to do but Im thinking its only because Im more stable &amp; level headed. I also deal with PTSD from childhood abuse &amp; early adult years. I take prozasin at night for it to curb nightmares. I did notice I began dreaming more often when I started taking the Lamictal &amp; nightmares... taking prozasin at night has done wonders.,0,27
Lamotrigine,I wasnt sure what to expect with this medication. I had been taking Prozac for years which did nothing for me and my anxiety but I was recently diagnosed with bipolar which makes so much more sense. I am still on the 25 mg lamotrigine dosage and I am on day 5. I cant believe how even my mood is. I used to have very high highs and semi low lows but I feel so balanced right now. Im hoping this continues. I feel so grateful that I feel like myself again.,8,5
Lamotrigine,I have only been taking this for a couple days. I feel emotionless and numb and have no interest in doing anything that I normally love to do. I can easily see how this can lead to  dark or suicidal thoughts. I would much rather live with my disorder and have some passion in my life than to be so unbelievably numb.

I was insistent on trying a medication that wouldnt make me gain weight so I read a lot of reviews on here and decided to try Lamictal. It absolutely changed my life - the ONLY bipolar medication that has worked for me. It is like night and day - looking back at my precious behavior is baffling to me now.

He diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and put me on Lamictal and abilify. I am now taking 125mg Lamictal and 15mg abilify. I honestly think that lamictal has calmed me down a bit. I am no longer agitated but still anxious. My social anxiety is still there and its getting worse. But I am slightly in peace with myself and no more blaming. The thing that concerns me the most is the social anxiety. I hope it fades away as I up my dosage.",0,18
Lamotrigine,"<b>Lamictal (lamotrigine):</b>			 This was the first time I took a mood stabilizer. I have a rare case of my bipolar disorder coming on at around 1 so I knew nothing different for 35yrs. Now it's known bipolars need mood stabilizers then it was random antidepressants. My negative about the drug is it does effect your short term memory &amp; can dumb you down. My decision was to be dumb &amp; sane instead of smart &amp; out of control. I took the highest dose. After 4 yrs &amp; the birth of a child the medication became much less effective so I've had to change. I had forgotten how horrible I felt off meds until I had to change. Lemictal saved me, it helped me become a better person &amp; live in less pain. As with every medication for bipolar disorder you have to weigh pros &amp; cons. I would not recommend this medication for anyone working in an intellectual based job where memory &amp; use of math as such is involved. It can drastically lower your abilities. For me at the time it was more then worth it",0,33
Lamotrigine,I cant believe the miracle this drug has been for me. A lifetime of hospitalizations and suffering. I have been diagnosed incorrectly with about every psychiatric disorder know to man. Have been on just about every drug for depression starting at 23 years old. Finally my depression and irritation became so crippling that I considered ending my life again. My care provider believes I have a bipolar II disorder and prescribed lamotrigine. Within a day I noticed a huge change in my mood. The irritability and depression became much better and I feel like living for the first time in my life. My issues with  insomnia have gotten worse but I will deal with that. I believe I have been given the chance to live the remaining years of my life in peace. Truly an answer to my prayers.,10,16

After a while that went away to.  I went to get my blood work done and requested it myself because the doctor said it wasn't necessary on lamotrigine it revealed mild grade neutropenia and I was told to keep taking this medication. After a while I started to feel more unwell and another blood test was done two weeks later which revealed worsening neutropenia.

Lamotrigine quietened my racing thoughts within the first month, delusions and hallucinations toned down, and the only suicidal ideation/downswing I've had since has been due to c-ptsd. I really cannot recommend this drug enough, it's been amazing for me to get my life back on track, with no sexual or weight issues- I actually have a higher sex drive and lost weight.  Now fellow bipolars: I know you worry about losing the manic aspects or being completely numb but this drug ain't like that.

Scariest thing I've been through with my mental health yet. It felt like an acid trip combined with mania. I read a medical journal report online that it is possible to have a hypomanic switch on a low dose.  I think anything that works somehow directly on serotonin is not for me anymore.  **I took this drug at 400 mg. Many years ago and it did nothing to lift my depression and now this.

I never realized  how much anxiety I had until I didnt . I didnt even realize that would help cure that.  Only side effects we minor headaches when I upped dosage and it was not bad and only 1 day.  I still struggle with falling asleep but that was before this medication (but sleep is improving) I have a clearer head with work too.  I would definitely recommend trying it.

My energy did improve, though I'm not positive that it was due to the new XR. I do think that taking the XR version is worth it to keep the level in your blood more stable.

I stuck it out for almost 1.5 months on Lamictal only 25 mg's, and trust me, I feel a world of a difference. My life has changed. I feel like I can focus. Although there is MILD emotional numbing, almost stoic, I am able to be present with people and calmly socialize. It is easier to process emotions, which used to be overwhelming before. It allowed my mindfulness and self acceptance practise to skyrocket.  Anyone planning on using this. Titrate slowly!!!!! My symptoms were too much handle when I shot up to 50MG's. I might be different, but please be patient with the drug and move slowly.",0,32
Lamotrigine,"I've been on lamotrigine for over 8 years and I can say it has given me my life back. Before my moods fluctuated quickly and I would have severe bouts of depression. At one point in my life it wasnt about if I was going to kill myself, it was just a matter of when was I going to kill myself. Although increasing the medication slowly was frustrating and took almost 4 months to get to my current dosage, 400mg daily, it was well worth it. My mood swings are less severe and dont occur as often, and Im able to cope with life again. It isnt a magic cure all, most medications arent and I think thats where some people get confused and frustrated, but its allowed me to be mentally stable enough to access other mental health services such as therapy. Since going on Lamictal my quality of life has increased drastically. The only side effect I experience is if I take it too late in the day, it keeps me awake at night.",10,4

I had stabbing pain down my arms and legs &amp; shooting pains in all my joints.  My heart was beating out of my chest, I was vomiting blood, etc. I'm a 21 yr old, healthy girl. I kept taking it for about a week longer. The pain only got worse. I felt like I was having a heart attack 24/7. I couldn't even hold a pen cuz my wrists hurts so bad. It got so bad that I went to the ER because I thought I was dying, my chest hurt so bad. They ran an EKG, which came back normal, but the doctor said I was running a high fever, &amp; my throat started closing very rapidly. They had to give me a bunch of shots of something  to help me breathe because iIbegan to lose oxygen supply to my brain.",1,9

I was discharged out on seroquel which helped with sleep and the panic but I would still get awful, suicidal downs. I suggested to my psych to put me on lamictal after doing some research.

Initially it caused body aches and fatigue, which I normally deal with due to fibromyalgia, but noticed it each time the dose increased. Started at 12.5mg and increased by 12.5 every 10 days. 150mg is the most I can take without the side effects becoming noticeable.

I do still have manic episodes from time to time which can be mild or severe. I take anxiety meds when I can to ease the mania but sometimes those dont help.

I never acquired any side effects at all. My short and long term memory is increased. My learning capabilities are in fact better now then ever before.

Also it took me at least 5 months until I got its full benefit. And it may cause you insomnia, need some ambien for that. Ambien stopped working after 5 months. And so when I tried melatonin it worked pretty well. Melatonin didn't work in the first months on this Drug. Only worked after the 5 months and then after few 2 months I didn't need it anymore.

Lamotrigine,Hi everyone...I want to share my experience on this drug. I was diagnosed bipolar 2 in 2015. At first doctors thought it was depression or/and post traumatic syndrome bc I went bankrupt right before I got sick. The doc tried all anti-depressants you can ever imagine in a matter of 3 weeks. It was a true nightmare. Then they realized that my bad reactions to antidepressants was the main reason to diagnose me as a bipolar 2. Thank God I didn't have any rash otherwise I don't know what would have happened. Understanding how lamictal works is vital. However each person is different. The metabolism is what you have to keep an eye on. I have a very fast metabolism. That helped me go up in this medication very fast from 25mg up to 200mg.,10,10

My mental state has been much better since reaching the therapeutic dose of 200mg. It took about 6 months to reach that dosage, and trust me when I say that I questioned its effictiveness during the whole time. But it's become clear to me this past year that Lamictal has enhanced my life. I was highly skeptical. This drug has made a drastic difference in my quality of life",10,18

Six months ago I saw different psychiatrist who calmed me about the rare side effects and explained that If I missed a day that I didn't have to dose up again. I'm currently on 150mg. I still experience some bipolar II symptoms but they are completely manageable. A higher dose stopped my symptoms completely.

After 20 yrs battling severe mental illness (now diagnosed as bipolar type II) without using medication, I decided to give it a proper chance. A suicidal episode brought me to the clinic, I was properly diagnosed &amp; started meds.  It took 3 mths to stabilise my mood by slowing increasing dosage.  I've been given my life back!!  My quality of life is better than it has ever been in the last 20 yrs, since the onset of my mood disorder. For anyone living w bipolar or a mood disorder, I encourage finding the right med regime, self-education, CBT or ACT &amp; mindfulness, healthy diet &amp; excercise.

After just a month (I titrated up quickly, so I've been on 100 for 2 weeks. probably best not do that there's a fatal skin disease you can get) my low level depression feels better.  I'd say it's genuinely beneficial for bipolar depression. A little dizziness but not so bad, and it fades.

I was on a dose of only 50mg a day and had fair improvement. 50 mg a day, however I slipped through the cracks. I got a general practioner to fill my prescriptions. 50 mg, 10 years without regulation and as those diagnosed with Bi-Polar II disorder know, the depression slowly crept up unnoticed by me. It was not until traumatized, I knew to seek help. Back on Lamictal for the second time, but this time at a 175 mg dose, without antidepressants or ADD medications.

I have had an incredibly increased libido, overall I can't believe how well its working in such a short time without the terrible side effects that other medications can give you.

Lamotrigine,<b>Lamictal (lamotrigine):</b>			 Lamictal has been the most all round effective medication I have take and that is saying a lot for a patient of 40 years. What I mean by that is my system rejected all antidepressants and antipsychotics because of a side effect called Akathesia. I sustained on lithium and Klonopin alone for a long time. Back then doctors were scared to death of Lamictal because of the rash that few to none got when properly prescribed. I couldn't find one to prescribe so I got it from my family doctor. That was the best day of my life. I titrated the lithium while slowly adding the Lamictal with no problems. I have been taking 450mg a day ever since. I also noticed how badly 30 years of lithium had hurt me. I no longer knew myself.,0,84

Then I started lamotrigine, now on 100mg/day. I increased venlafaxine back to 225mg expecting to go manic, but instead I feel clear-headed. Friends have noticed I don't lose my train of thought often, and that I seem more stable. I have been diagnosed Bipolar I, but am more like a II, which I agree with.

I was like that already just worse on those medicines. Finally seeing another doctor trying to find help he put my on Lamictal. Small dose at first and now I'm on 400mg/day.

I started to lose hair, my fingernails were so think I broke nails typing (even on many vitamins and prescription vitamin D). I would bruise just by a bracelet resting on my arm for a few minutes and then the bruise wouldn't go away, the worst side effect was terrible circulation.  I have been on Topamax and experienced the poor circulation they talk about all the time, but this was something else entirely. I couldn't feel my finger tips and my feet had NO feeling.

As I write this I recall that before starting Lamictal I had excruciating pain in my solar plexus. I was in a deep state of bipolar depression with spikes of rage and extreme anxiety at least 2 times each month. Lamictal has made these mixed state less severe and not as frequent.

I have no side effects that I'm aware of yet. I am just starting out and on such a low dose. After reading all others here, I think I would like to stay on a lower dose, maybe less than 100mg. We will see. There is another part of me that just does not want any of this but the reality of it all is, I may feel this way now because the medicines are working.
