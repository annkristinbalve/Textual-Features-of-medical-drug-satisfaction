Invega Sustenna,"Taking this drug invega sustenna helped a bit with my schizophrenia symptoms. The side effects on the other hand were something else. I was significantly slowed down both mentally and physically. I did lose about 5 pounds and lost interest in food most probably due to feeling really depressed about my condition. I also couldnt stop walking about, I couldnt sit still anywhere for up to 2 mins. I also had abnormal muscle movements, my vision became really bad and blurry and I was drowsy all the time especially after taking a dose.",3,0
Invega Sustenna,"I don't feel much on this medication.  It takes away the pleasure of enjoying things like video games sadly.  I've lost my sense of smell while on this drug.  I've gained the most weight I have compared to other antipsychotics.  I tried coming off it for a month with no success, it's really strong on preventing delusions and hearing voices.  I can't ejaculate or feel much sexual pleasure while on this medication.",5,7
Invega Sustenna,I've been on this med Invega for years without it I was suicidal and often hurt myself with this med I'm happy again and have no desire to cause harm to myself only side effects are weight gain and long sleep,9,5
Invega Sustenna,Gained 40 lbs in two weeks right after taking it. Made me pale (I'm olive complexion). Made anxiety horrible for a few months (could not stop moving around). Messed up sleeping habits for a few months. Stopped my periods for three months in a row. Never had problems with any of these things before taking. Been off for ten months now just now getting back to close to normal.,2,10
Invega Sustenna,"I now have a deadly and nontreatable heart condition called a Left Anterior Fascicular Block (LAFB) due to over prescribed high doses of Invega and not being diagnosed 3 years in a row with hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol and extremely high triglycerides) and hyperprolactinemia (abnormal hormones causing loss of erection and sperm production) and 'reduced function' stage 2 kidney damage as well as 65lbs weight gain, none of which was diagnosed or referred to a PCP for treatment. Now I am without a treatment plan and my fate is sealed. Bad drug period.",1,9
Invega Sustenna,"I had a psychotic episode from drug use, they made me take injection and I feel like it was worst drug possible, I honestly can't explain how bad the side effects are. You get a weird smell odour, irregular heart beat, no up and go, no sex drive, dizzy all the time. I am off of it now and I am hoping I can come good again",1,14
Invega Sustenna,"Took 100 mg of the paliperidone drug (european dosing) when I was psychotic and, for 1 year (same dose, later added 20 mg Zyprexa), while the psychosis had gone, delusions and hallucinations persisted the entire time. Also, it raised my prolactin level to rocketing levels (2000 mIU/L).  Although it kept me away from psychosis, there are better alternatives for the disease.",3,4
Invega Sustenna,"Lets start off by saying it causes bloating. I hate the feeling. I been dieting and exercising but no results after eating. I have no sex drive, tiredness, no emotion, and lack of energy. I also dont want to leave the house. This shot has worked for my voices but the side effects are worst. Hopefully getting off of it soon.",1,9
Invega Sustenna,this drug is driving me crazy! I don't like the weight gain and it slows me down considerably... I can't eat whatever! every thing has sodium in it. my body has gone through the wringer(think using the potty) and people have to take things away to keep me from committing suicide.things are done behind my back to keep me stable as well. the edge is gone (me saying the f word on regular basis) but what about sleep? I am 43 years old and i need my beauty sleep! I never want to feel the feeling of being awake for weeks on end! Guess It doesn't help that I discovered coffee... bring on the drugs that encourage you and not make you fat and bloated!,0,7
Invega Sustenna,"Bad drug, it increases prolactin level's by a lot, in fact this drug ranks among the highest drugs that increase serum prolactin levels, and massive increase in prolactin levels reduces your testosterone by a hand full, don't expect to have a baby while on this medication. Don't expect an erection, Don't even bother with sex drive, that's for losers anyway. A massive decrease in libido. In short, this drug among a few other anti-psychotics will leave you feeling like a mix between a two year boy and a two year old girl.",1,17
Invega Sustenna,"The one positive effect of this drug (InVega Sustenna 150 mg every 4 weeks) is that it controls my hallucinations and delusions.  But the trade off is really hard to bear.  Ive lost all the joy in my life, the anhedonia is so bad that I have to live in a constant state of pretending to be happy because I am now unable to feel any kind of happiness or pleasure especially from activities I once enjoyed very much.  I cant recall things and my memories have evaporated.  I feel blunted and flat all the time.  I cant function in a meaningful way, and feel more depressed than I ever have in my life.  Ive gained lots of weight, lost muscle tone yet I feel agitated like I want to jump out of my skin all the time.  Being on this medication is a living nightmare.  I am 43 and feel like life has come to a screeching halt.",3,22
Invega Sustenna,"I took 6 injections over a 6 month period. I didn't notice much in the first couple of months. It helped with the paranoia, I still heard voices to a lesser extent. Around the 5th month, I had noticed I gained 50 lbs (115 to 165) It happened so rapidly. I also began to lactate. That was all horrible but the worst of it was the severe anhedonia. They wanted to slowly taper me off the injection but I refused to take any more after the 6 month period. I felt mentally slower. I got no pleasure from listening to music, or watching TV. I stopped laughing. This is just my personal experience, but if you look up this medicine you will find there are many people that have gone through a similar experience.  It's been 14 months since my last injection and I think I have mentally fully recovered. I think this drug is too potent. I am almost certain it gave me some sort of brain damage. One of the biggest regrets of my life is taking this drug, I was better off before.",1,28
Invega Sustenna,Changed my life!,10,4
Invega Sustenna,"The combination of drugs I was on, which included invega sustenna, caused a great amount of pain and suffering. Puking, coughing, kidney pain, prostate pain, brain on fire, lock jaw in the middle of the night, in some order which I've forgotten.",0,12
Invega Sustenna,Terrible drug. Left me with no emotions and complete anhedonia. Im stopping the injections in hopes of recovering to my former self.,1,17
Invega Sustenna,the only thing I'm noticing with Invega Sustenna is the bloated feeling. My symptoms are reduced some what me being a female and whatever...guess it's because I try not to eat whatever....,0,3
Invega Sustenna,"Worst experience of my life. I can't describe all of the side effects I had on invega Sustenna in 1000 characters, but my mind was disturbingly blank on this medication. It was as if all of my conscious thoughts were gone. I gained 25 pounds even though I just got the initial dose &amp; lost muscle. My delusions did go away so it worked for that, but it felt like it was because my thoughts stopped. I've gotten 4 sprains and one pulled muscle since I got injected with this poison at the end of August last year. My skin started flaking off and and my hair was falling out. I couldn't feel any emotions. I was unable to orgasm for the first month. There were more side effects, &amp; I don't think I fully conveyed the desperation I felt on this medication. I would like to let people who have gotten on it &amp; hate it that there is hope &amp; you will get better - once you are off it",1,31
Invega Sustenna,"I was injected twice Invega Sustenna.  I had no sex drive, no emotion, no pleasure for the first three weeks. I was miserable and it lasted 8 to 9 months off the drug. I wouldn't recommend this drug to anybody. I am on abilify maintena now and I am feeling much better. 0/10 invega sustenna",1,22
Invega Sustenna,"I've been on this drug/medicine for about two years and it has caused a lot of problems in my life. It barely helped with the auditory hallucinations such as the voices and paranoia. I feel like a zombie all the time, really tired, drained of energy, and like my brain is slowed down. I've had little to no sex drive (Sexual Dysfunction) and have no pleasure from sex. Within the first couple weeks of getting the injection of invega sustenna every month. I get muscle stiffness in my neck, arms, and hands. I feel like I can't breathe along with a rapid heart beat and a fever. I become confused, unable to function, dizzy, and lightheaded. This happens two to three times a month within a few weeks after getting the injection. I believe it might be because of NMS  (neuroleptic malignant syndrome) which is a rare side effect of the drug/medicine which might cause death. This is a horrible drug/medicine for me iIm going to try a different medicine from a different doctor and hope for the best.",3,17
Invega Sustenna,"This medicine is horrible every time I take it I am unable to workout. I can't even run a mile I am so weak. I get restless leg syndrome, fatigue, weight gain, and blur vision. I'm done taking medicine sick of it",1,26
Invega Sustenna,"This has helped with the symptoms of my illness. There are negative symptoms to it though. Foggy emotions, not sure if its cuz of the illness or the med. I am sort of happy now though, but no sex drive, periods, and gained 75 pounds. I took fluphenazine for a couple months, lost 20 pounds but felt worse than when I was on invega.",4,3
Invega Sustenna,"If I could rate this medication a 0, I would. Going on this medication was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I have bipolar I disorder and suffered a severe manic episode that didnt respond to Seroquel or Risperdal. The psychiatrist prescribed me Invega and while it got rid of my mania and psychosis, it completely altered my personality. I had absolutely no emotion at all. I did not feel any sort of joy or happiness. Not to mention I gained at least 20pounds (Im a very active 24 year old). The suicidal thoughts were so severe that I needed to be hospitalized. The absolute worst part is that even when you stop Invega, it stays in your system for months. It has an extremely long half life. If you want to be a zombie and lose interest in everything you ever loved, then take this medicine. If youd like to be a productive member of society, avoid this medication at all costs. Find another medicine.",1,34
Invega Sustenna,"I started taking this medication as a monthly injection  for Hearing voices/ paranoia and I took it for about 6 months. It made me gain 40lbs, I lost all sex drive, my mind became foggy and I felt mentally slower. I also got severe anhedonia and became unable to feel the effects of alcohol, cigarettes. I don't recommend this medication to anyone.. I've been off it for 4 months and am still dealing with the side effects of this medication. I will say that it did reduce the voices significantly but only because it's such a powerful mind numbing drug. I would advise to try something else if you really need a medication. Basically a chemical lobotomy.",2,20
Invega Sustenna,Invega Sustenna was a horrible experience for me. This medication caused me to gain 20-30 pounds. It stopped my monthly cycles. I was also not able to experience sexual pleasure.  This medication ruins lives.,1,16
Invega Sustenna,"I've been taking invega sustenna for a little over a year now and for the majority of that year I had absolutely no positive or negative symptoms. Recently though, the paranoia a slight delusions have started to creep back into my mind. My psychiatrist upped my dose to 234 mg and now I can't stop eating and I'm hungry all the time. I already had a binge eating disorder but now it's infinitely worse. Also, the newer symptoms are still there. We're currently trying metformin to help with my appetite but so far it's doing absolutely nothing. I'm now thinking that I want to try switching to ziprasidone. It's supposed to be really good with weight management, but I'm worried it might not be as effective with my mental symptoms? I can't freak out because I'm working and going to school now. Back to invega though, I guess I can thank this medication for giving me my life back and making it so I can function in society. But I can't handle the weight gain...",0,5
Invega Sustenna,"Gained over 30 lbs on this medication even though I'm eating less and I've cut out sugar from my diet. What's even more depressing is that even though I'm heavier I'm actually weaker than I've been when I was skinny and off meds. Also when I skip my injection for a week I'm hitting threes and long two's like it's nothing on the basketball court, while on the medication there's no point in going to the court. Also the results of treatment are suboptimal: I don't have friends, during 6 years of treatment I've never been on a date (which probably also has something to do with poor sexual functioning while on the medication), I stay at home all the time, am unemployed and gained the status of a disabled person. However when on the medication I don't have positive symptoms like thought broadcasting. I'm seriously considering switching the medication, I'm depressed, desperate, feel awful all the time and can't do it anymore.",3,14
Invega Sustenna,"It works! but you have to want it too.  Mental illness is an illness of the brain.  The mind..  So you have to couple your taking of available meds and therapy.  You have to change the way your mind works and thinks.  Think on purpose for up to an hour a day by repeating a phrase or quote such as if you're a voice hearer repeat up to an hour a day (I cannot hear voices, they aren't real) x repeat.  Fish oil, good sleep, eat healthy and exercise every other day.  Look after yourself and work your thought life out.  I have schizophrenia, Bi-Polar and depression and hold 2 small businesses that I run for most of my work-week (Music Studio owner operator and Stock Market Trader)  I've had schizophrenia for 14 years and for 7 of those years ran a highly successful business where I used to live (talking 7 figures)   EAT healthy! THINK right, Exercise AND Do what you know you should!  positive positive positive.  you CAN do this!",9,23
Invega Sustenna,This medication gave me a stroke at the age of 25,1,23
Invega Sustenna,I find the drug makes me calm/relaxed.. but I have the most severe insomnia. I've gone 7 weeks without much sleep and have 0 energy or motivation. This drug has basically ruined my life and turned me into a stay at home vegetable with no future. Gonna switch to abilify and hopefully have a life back and good healthy sleep back,1,16
Invega Sustenna,Invega sustenna is gross.  It blocks dopamine in the brain. So causes a long list of side effects. This drug is a gimmick it has no therapeutic value whatsoever.  I think I threw up over a dozen times!,1,13
Invega Sustenna,"Warning: this shot will destroy your life. I only had 1 shot, the 234 mg. I dropped out of school, became depressed. It's been 3 years and I still suffer from absence of emotion. It doesn't sound like much but trust me, life becomes empty without emotions.  In some cultures, hallucinations are a sign from beyond. People that can hear or see things will often become shamans, medicine men, or healers.  I highly reccommend meditation, and/or seeing someone that is an energy healer.",1,21
Invega Sustenna,This medicine helped stop me talking to two women.,1,2
Invega Sustenna,"So I've been on this medication since 2014. Diagnosed with schizophrenia back in 2011 when I told doctors I was visited by spirits at a young age. They didn't believe me though I swear on my life it is true. Anyway, I was on 150mg. Had the worst side effects you could imagine. Very high prolactin levels, lactating from my breasts, amenorrhoea, absolutely no motivation at all, pretty much glued to my bed &amp; phone. So they adjusted my dose twice &amp; now I am feeling a bit better. Not a lot better though I would say. They say that a schizophrenia diagnosis is something you deal with for life so I would be careful what you tell your doctors. You could be on medication for life.",0,9
Invega Sustenna,I have a loved one who had a very long period (over 7 years) where she was unmedicated with active frightening visual and auditory hallucinations before she was able to receive help. After a 4 month hospitalization and oral antipsychotics including Zyprexa she was still totally delusional. After starting community based treatment she was started on Invega Sustana and within 2 months she was better than she has been in over 10 years. I was able to see glimpses of who she was before her brain disorder took over her life. She thinks that the shots are like water and they do nothing. Anosognosia  (lack of insight) is a very difficult issue with her so I am beyond pleased this medications ability to improve my love ones life.,0,9
Invega Sustenna,"Absolutely amazing. Made me back to normal, before I took the invega shot I had extreme paranoia thinking people wanted to kill me, thought the government was purposely making it hard for me  not to be homeless and literally thought my life was like the Truman show at some points and that everyone was actors around me, and wanted to kill me, literally within a day after taking this my life had changed and I became myself again before all the medication started.",10,8
Invega Sustenna,I was going through thyroid storm because I had taken liquid iodine with thyroid pills. At the time I was having a episode... and forced treatment against my will. The doctor told me that it was the only drug I could take and coerced me into taking it. 432 mg shot that was nearly the twice the max dose. I didn't like it because before I was on a dopamine 2 and not dopamine 3 antagonist like this drug does. Absolute crap! Before the episode I was healthy able to run 10k in under 40 minutes on Seroquel xr.... and now I'm dealing with withdrawals and high inflammation that was .7 now 4.3 because of stupid shot. It'll make you not able to think or do your job. You'll lose interest in things like working out and being healthy. The drug is rubbish!!,1,10
Invega Sustenna,Well I have been on this medication for some time now.  It has helped me with the voices but to be honest you do sleep  a lot and that's the only constant this medication has.  It makes you eat a lot and as far as sex drive goes lol I won't talk about it.  I think that it depends on who you are around to make you feel depressed you have to keep in mind that it's a serious disease but with medication it can be manageable. And if you are getting too fat exercise. You will get the weight off.  Keep positive people and remember the struggle is never done we may always have a stigma put on us or a label put on us but prove the enemy wrong.  Be the best you can be and shine bright like a diamond.  And remember god loves u,0,15
Invega Sustenna,"Okay let me get started. Every social worker, psychologist, and mental health doctor shouldn't prescribe this drug to anyone. It is harmful in so many ways. I took it for 1-2 years because they said: I had said that  I had bad schizophrenia. I did not have bad anything except a drug issue- which they already  knew  as they had tested my urine, but they  didn't take that into consideration. If you take this drug you will sleep away your life. You will lose you train of thought every 5 sentences. You will probably 75% chance to lose your job in a fast pace environment. When you take this drug you will lose muscles, goals, and cause you too get depressed.",1,18
Invega Sustenna,My symptoms are so much better with Invega Sustenna.,10,7
Invega Sustenna,"I've been taking invega (all forms) since 2011. I have to say it is a god send. Risperdal and abilify gave me sexual dysfunction. This at least allows me to get an erection. It's done a great job at controlling my positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The voices are dulled down to the point of single sentences and like only 1-4 times a day so it's a lot more managable in day to day life. Started on sustenna, went on the tablets and now on Trinza. All versions work very well for me. This medication is the metabolite form of risperdal and it's a god send. It's easier on the liver and I highly recommend sustenna and Trinza as the form to take for schizophrenia/schizoaffective!",10,12
Invega Sustenna,"Before my psychotic break that turned into a delusional police chase I was manic, terribly delusional, thought the devil was everywhere I went, thought people were after me, thought devil controlled electronics and the internet. Just too many bad symptoms and after receiving invega injection I've been told that I was more outgoing, and had absolutely no symptoms. But the side effects sucks such as high prolactin levels which resulted in low testosterone, anhedonia, and lower emotions",9,14
Invega Sustenna,"Hi folks. Have been on Vega inj. For 2months. Most hallucinations, auditory, visual, and mental gone. Has been a game changer for me as my life was completely unmanageable before. Still not leaving home much and have gained a few pounds nothing to drastic but it beats having conversations with people only I can see and not having a choice about it.  Also my insurance wouldn't cover it, it's about $2000usd for 1month inj.   Thanks, hope this helps.",9,18
Invega Sustenna,The side effects are devastating for me.,1,10
Invega Sustenna,"My side effect was like no other side effect I have had. I was leaning to the left no matter what I was doing. Sitting, standing, walking, even driving a car, My 3 boys revoked my license. I really was  okay and thankful to them. I am and have been going to a pain clinic for many years because of my back. It only made my back hurt more. Free of mental pain? Free of physical pain? Physical won!! My family doctor figured it out. So I guess just watch for anything different, Because if there was any good, the bad took it away. That is my opinions,  It hurt me more  than it helped me, I am very to see how many received help and relief from it.",1,8
Invega Sustenna,"this medication is the best anti psychotic i ever took, i'm getting the shot 244 mg, and the delusions and hallucinations are under control, this medicine is a life saver. the side effects i experience is anxiety and weight but overall it's a great medicine.",8,18
Invega Sustenna,"This medication is weird , it basically shuts down your brain, you will become a zombie after this medication,  gained 100 lbs , stabilizes mood and so expensive.",6,13
Invega Sustenna,"Clears the mind of weird thoughts, delusions and hallucinations. Weight gain has been noted as well as a general feeling of restlessness and drowsiness. I'm always on slow-motion and need to think things twice or 3 times. Still better than having conversations with dead people or thinking my brain can see in the future... by the way, DON'T try quitting this drug cold turkey. It's a recipe for disaster.",8,22
Invega Sustenna,Gained weight. Too much. Fear of cholesterol and diabetes. Less work. Lost a girlfriend.,1,17
Invega Sustenna,My wife has suffered from late onset schizophrenia with severe positive symptoms for over 10 years. She started Invega Sustena treatment (monthly injection) a year ago and has made dramatic improvements. All of her positive symptoms have gone away. Residual negative symptoms remain but is now manageable with talk therapy. The injection method helps with compliance as daily pills are difficult to maintain and easy to discontinue. This is a wonder drug...,10,27
Invega Sustenna,"My daughter had the injection this month.It stopped her psychosis, still a little paranoia. The first ten days severe pain in neck. Also some dizziness still and balance problems she says. She took cogentin for neck. Some relief from the neck now. Another issue from blood test is high prolactin level. We will be seeing her Dr this week .Dont know if side effects worth it",7,17
Invega Sustenna,"Very high smoking sensation, weight gain, tiredness, and insomnia. But its the best antipsychotic med for me.",10,21
Invega Sustenna,I have been on Invega for 5 months now and it has significantly improved my quality of living. Prior to the shot I was on numerous antipsychotics and would begin to stop taking the pills and go into relapse with symptoms. I'm not on the shot and auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoia have decreased dramatically. I like that it is a monthly shot and it cuts down remembering (or wanting) to take a pill once or twice a day.,9,29
Invega Sustenna,"I found this medication to cause side effects of swaying while standing up &amp; sometimes rocking back and forth whilst sitting down. Because this is taken monthly I am on 150mg, towards the end of the month I became unwell and psychotic symptoms reoccurred. Delusional thoughts mainly. I am now going to try Abilify and hope I don't have bad side effects but I know that without my medication I would relapse.",5,23
Invega Sustenna,"Invega is working great on auditory symptoms and no lethargy noted.  I have noted some of the adverse side effects after the first dose: sudden weight gain, indigestion, pain at injection site and sore throat. In addition to these there has been increasing facial and abdominal bloating, I am concerned but there is no other medicine I am aware of at this time and the doctor feels the benefit outweighs the side effects.",9,31
Invega Sustenna,This medication is Great.,9,31
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 I used to take this drug Seroquel for 7 years. The only side effects I had was sleeping too much, no way to wake up in the morning and still sleeping for 1st hour of being awake. Once I threw up breakfast because my body was just not working yet. And I was always putting guilt on me, because I didn't know that this is pill side effect. I used to think I am lazy, because I couldn't wake up. When having job, I always needed someone who woke me up, because I always turned off the alarm unaware, while sleeping. Only now when I changed pills and can normally wake up I see that I am not lazy and I am very happy for that fact! Another side effect was muscles cramps in legs - when I went to bed, I couldn't stay still, I had to move my legs because of some weird muscle tightens. This happened occasionally. The side effects were not so terrible. It didn't do any harm to mind and emotions.",0,5
Quetiapine,"The quetiapine manufactured by Roane is a poor substitute for seroquel. In fact the 54 527 tablet is dangerous, non effective and different from any form of the medicine ever used before. Highly recommend it being banned.",1,0
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 My son has autism and anxiety.  He started experiencing psychosis/auditory hallucinations at age 18...so bad he would yell and get very angry.  We have started Seroquel, on it over 2 months now, some improvement but not great.  His doc has now upped it from 25mg and we are now 500 mg.  Along with Mirtazipine and Ativan for sleep.  Hoping we can stay ahead of of his episodes instead of chasing them.  Ill give an update.  Super helpful to read others reviews.  praying we see some good results.",0,8
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 I've had a lot of side effects caused by this drug I never knew it was caused by this drug, I had high blood pressure, terrible gas last for days, muscle cramps, seizures I gained 60 lbs or more imbalance drug for 5 years or more I would not recommend it for anybody",0,5
Quetiapine,quetiapine Really works for my insomnia and schizophrenia. Wake up with less anxiety and feel refreshed. No weight gain as I eat healthy and do regular exercise.,10,4
Quetiapine,<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 I started 100 mg of Seroquel after Abilify failed at managing my symptoms.  On Abilify I was waking with constant anxiety and restless leg syndrome.  Once I started taking Seroquel anxiety and restless leg syndrome disappeared and Im feeling the best Ive felt in a long time.  The first week I was tired but after that passed its been nothing but a sense of inner peace and calmness.  So happy I tried this medicine again.  I think the dose of 100 mg is a perfect dose for me.,0,34
Quetiapine,<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 I rely on this for my sleep and psychosis episodes. I take 1/2 the 25mg as needed. No weight gain. I exercise and eat healthy. It's a lifesaver knowing my scary episodes can be treated with this.,0,23
Quetiapine,<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 Seroquel makes the psychosis easier to deal with but makes me very tired. experienced side effect drowsiness every time I took it.,0,15
Quetiapine,<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 I find Seroquel great I was diagnosed with schitzophenia in 2001 and haven't been hospitalized since then. It works great for me,0,20
Quetiapine,"<b>Seroquel (quetiapine):</b>			 This drug has really helped me with the voices and the paranoia. I have been on it for nearly 3 years. I have been on pretty much every antipsychotic there is and have been dealing with this illness for a long, long time. The downside is that you will gain weight. I have lost some of it by reducing calories and taking metformin. Walking seems to help too. If you do take this one, stay as active as you can to avoid diabetes because as my psychiatrist told me It will happen eventually Also, I adopted a vegatarian diet to help lower other risks with this one. The other downside is that it can make you very tired. I take 400mg at night and 75mg in the morning and another 75mg in the afternoon. I still hear voices and don't want to be around other people but it is much more manageable and I can at least have some kind of life. To be honest, I probably would have killed myself if it were not for this drug. I am surprised I even wrote this as I am a very paranoid person.",0,51
Quetiapine,"Was on haloperidol for many years and was somewhat helpful with main  schizophenia symptoms, but my psychiatrist was worried about tardive dyskinesia as Haldol use has a high incidence of TD. I switched to quetiapine (Seroquel) and many of the remaining psychotic symptoms went away and my confidence came back and I had energy and fell asleep easily and slept well. I was more social and less socially anxious. Months down the road, I realized I had mania. It started to cause problems with my relationships because I talked TOO much, and became much too task oriented, less sensitive to my family's feelings, and was agitated. Mania makes you feel great, but it really isn't a good thing. AH started presenting again, so I upped my quetiapine to double the dose (under supervision). Now TD seems to presenting significantly. I love quetiapine, but it has a lot of upsides and downsides.",7,5
Quetiapine,"So on paper this drug worked miracles. I could live a normal life and function again, for the short 6.5 months I took this the effects became less and less, so my practitioner prescribed (alongside this medication) Olanzapine.  I began having unusual twitches in the face, odd numb feelings too, so I spoke to them and they said not to worry it's a normal side effect - ok then, I'll take that. 2 weeks later I am struggling to speak, my sentences stop in their tracks and my throat tightens up, my heart was fluttering and pounding all day so we visit the ER.

Last October my mom woke me up just a few hours after taking it. And I couldn't even comprehend what she was saying. So along with the schizophrenia I also have sleep apnea I stop breathing in my sleep, thank god I can figure it out pretty fast and wake up. On seroquel it's impossible and also makes it worse. Even after more then ten years I really hate this medication. I haven't taken it for a for maybe a year or more. But they still prescribe it.  They started me on Abilify which.

There's no getting off of it. I sleep in till 2 to 5 pm every day. I'm sluggish all day. It never helped with any of my symptoms of schizophrenia. It makes me crave sugar immensely. This drug is very dangerous. You have to be very careful when taking it. Don't drive or be around people you don't know or trust. Let's just say I could sleep through anything. This drug should be illegal even if it does help some people with their mental illness. There are other things people can take. Risperdal for example does wonders for me. I'm working with my doctor on getting off of Seroquel. I didn't do it sooner because I'm so sick I can barely accomplish anything really. I just want to say to all schizophrenics I'm so sorry.

My understanding is that  Topamax is normally used to treat seizures but this medication also helps with impulsivity (which she struggles with as well).   A side effect is that its an appetite suppressant, or at least thats how it effects my daughter.  She currently takes  100 mg a day and is back down to her regular weight.

Abilify and Haldol turned me into a complete zombie it was terrible. Risperdal had sexual side effects and of course the breast growth issue, but I would say Risperdal is the second best one behind Seroquel.

About 18 months of this and worse, a very dangerous situation.  Sectioned 8 times through 2018. A therapist helping me mentioned a client that would throw TV's through windows, fighting, hearing voices, seeing things.. Invega completely cured him.  My wife knew she needed help and tried Invega. Within a couple of hours of taking the pill she stopped hearing the voices, could read a book for the first time in years as she could finally focus. She is now taking shots along with the pills.  She is better than I could have ever imagined.   I couldnt recommend Invega highly enough.  There are very few side effects and her head is clear.",10,15
Invega,"I got diagnose with schizophrenia and bipolar in the hospital. I was taking respidone which was helping me a lot but then I start taking invega. This medicine has ruined me. All of the things that I've loved doing now sucks.   I was on it for 4 months but I've been off of it for 3 months now but I'm still dealings with side effects. I can't sit still or lay still. I'm always tired my tongue is always numb my speech is off. I can't have a simple conversation I can't sleep at night. I hate waking up in the morning, my thoughts are all confusing and I feel weak. My  body is really sensitive......I just miss the old me.",1,41
Invega,This drug ruined me. I was fine before after they forced me to take it. I've been unable to write music since  which was what I had a passion for. This drug has made me depressed and given me anxiety which I was never experiencing before the drug. Beware of this drug it helps some and can ruin others,0,35
Invega,I have been taking Invega prolonged release tablets for 8 years.  I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and put on 3mg  and it took a little while for the delusions to end. I then fell into deep depression. I couldn't stand my head the way it was.  This drug blocked all my mind wandering that I loved so much.  I was given a 6 week course of ECT and put on 75mg dothepin antidepressant and invega upped to 6mg.  When the dose was increased to 6mg I had heart palpitations and couldn't sit still in a chair from stiff joints and was constantly falling asleep.   My psych blamed invega lowered my dose to 3mg and increased my dothepin to 150mg.  I was still robotic in thought and movement but I could lead a productive life.  My head did feel very dry and I was in survival mode though.  I started having 2000mg fish oil capsules a day and my thoughts became fluid and so did my joints and movement.  It's not a cure but I would recommend fish oil capsules to people with psychotic illness taking these meds.,8,27
Invega,"Horrible side effects!!! Caused facial hair, missed periods, swollen tender breast, I would produce breast milk though I was not pregnant, severe uncontrolled muscle jerks/ spasms/ changed color of pubic hairs. After a year I still had involuntary movements and spasms. My neighbors assumed I had Parkinson disease.",1,21
Invega,If you really have schizophrenia like I do this medicine really helps. Yes it can have side effects that really are as bad as the schizophrenia itself. The thing is skizophrenia is a illness that is up there with cancer its nice to have been offered medical care for it for once.,7,6
Invega,"This drug works for me. I have an injection once a month. First, I was on Abilify, but this drug was not working the way it should. For hardcore schizophrenia Invega is a very good choice. My libido has plummeted and I gained some weight. My psychosis are gone. Of course there's downsides to this drug, but it does what it promises.",8,7
Invega,"My son (23 year old) got the Invega shot. It's the worst thing ever. It's making him cripple, still hearing voices, shuffling when he walks, insomnia. This drug needs to be taken off the market I am going to write to the FDA it's very expensive and does nothing to help. Where are our tax money going? Why isn't there a cure? The insurance companies are blood suckers.  The  poor mental health patients cannot get any help. I am so sick and tired of this disease right now I just want my child back.",1,39
Invega,I'm not like these other people only side effect I've noticed is I seem to a flat emotional response. I consider it a improvement over the way I was thinking before. It's not a terrible medication for me. Just goes to show you everyone is different,6,7
Invega,This medicine is horrible. As soon as started to take the injection It caused a severe depression. I've never been depressed.,0,25
Invega,I have been on this medication on and off for about 5 months now and its been rough I cant think of anything positive to say about it I cant sleep I have to take medicine just to sleep I have been feeling depressed and unmotivated and I have gained so much weight I use to weigh 165lb after getting back on this medication I am now 187lb after about a couple of weeks.  I'd honestly rather that I have delusions and hear voices than to have life stripped away from me like this. I am not hearing voices but my doctor still wants to keep me on it no emotions or feelings on this med currently on 156mg injection,1,12
Invega,Worst medication ever. Ruined my health. It's chemical lobotomy.,1,13
Invega,This med made him permanently impotent.,1,13
Invega,I was put on this medication.  By doctors telling me that I heard voices.  When I didn't.  I was put in the hospital.  By a police officer  who thought I wasn't fit to drive. As I was having a diabetic hypo.  He thought I was on drugs.  And locked me in the  hospital for 3 weeks.  I was forced to have injections of invega. After this I had stabbing pains in my liver my blood sugar levels jumped I gained 15kgs.  I haven't been able to orgasem. It has been 3 years  since I was put on it. And 18 months since I last had it. I am still over weight.  I'm now on diabetes medication.  My liver is nearly 3 times the size it should be. And my sex life is over . All because of this evil medication.  It should be banned.,1,24
Invega,"Invega Sustenna is making me sicker and sicker. I can not keep food down any more, and the doctor will not change it. Find a doctor that knows the walsh protocol. Using the The Walsh protocol you can put an end to your illness. Dr William Walsh made the protocol, and it has become widespread in the UK, Ireland and Australia. There are a rare few doctors who do this over the internet, but you need a little bit of money for them. I am going to try and educate my doctor about walsh protocol  and see what happens.",0,10
Invega,"This medication is an absolute waste of time. I have been on Invega for a little less than 2 years now and I can with absolute confidence ascertain that it has done nothing for me. Aside from the decrease in sexual appetite and libido, difficulty having and maintaining erections, little to no ejaculatory fluid (which is really frustrating btw), the muscle tremors I am experiencing, and the 30 pounds I have gained since starting this medication , it is with no doubt an absolute and total waste of money. I definitely would not recommend this medication to anyone. Save yourselves the time and money and DO NOT take this medication.",1,13
Invega,"Was doing well on 4 mg risperidone but wanted to try an injectable long acting med. Doctor suggested I start with Invega oral to be sure it would work. Tried 6 mg Invega for a month but never felt as good as with risperidone. Made me depressed, tired, insomnia and even had some breakthrough delusions. So glad I didn't go straight to injections. Restarted risperidone and feel good again. It must work for some people but not for me. No data anywhere comparing Invega to risperidone which is odd because the drugs are related. No evidence this is a better drug than risperidone.",1,8
Invega,"I feel like this medication is making me feel extremely depressed in a way I haven't suffered before. Unfortunately, my doctor says this can't be the case and it must be my condition ( despite the fact I have never felt this way before).",2,15
Invega,"Total scam.  I've been on this drug for 3 years. Since being on it, It caused acute arm paralysis, dystonia, difficulty speaking, delirium which lasted for a month and it caused weight gain and man boobs. When I first received the shot, it felt like my brain was about to explode. I had extremely high blood pressure on this medicine- 178/105. After I stopped it, my blood pressure is 110/78. I experienced temporal lobe damage from this medicine and a CT scan showed atrophy of my brain after I stopped taking it. Be careful- many psychiatrists receive grants and stipends from big pharma and receive extra insurance money to peddle more drugs to as many patients as possible. This is because of our fee-for-service healthcare system.",1,17
Invega,I had been on Haldol before which I am allergic to and it caused wasting away disease.  Invega was my last option and it helped fix what Haldol seemed to have ruined and took away a lot of the scary stuff I was dealing with like seeing people in my room.  The only thing is I am still hearing voices but they are mostly nice.  I am on 234mg a month.,9,14
Invega,"I was put on this med while in the hospital. I started having breathing issues ( thought I had bronchitis) and rapid weight gain. I went to refill the med after the first month and the pharmacist noticed that the Invega had bad interactions with one of my other meds and refused to fill it. I'm stepping down and the breathing issues are lessening but i'm still having problems with the weight. The days I take it, I am insatisably hungry. It made me feel better mentally but the rest was rubbish.",3,10
Invega,"About to depart invega so felt to document my experience. 5 years have been good on invega. the pamphlet said as clean as we can make it or some such and sure enough the mind felt cleaner. If I was in room all day I would feel like my brain was drenched in depression. invega made it fresh. Was able to take an interest in new things and grew over that time.  Male Sexual function: 9 mg say good bye, 6mg hints of life, 3 mg omg I thought it left forever Thank U God Weight: kind of hard to manage diet and exercise. its like you need a scientist to work out satisfaction vs calorie control. beyond me, though weight training helped me feel good.  Tiredness: very tired after work on all dosages. Hard to motivate to exercise but very rewarding,",8,14
Invega,InVega did treat my crazy and voices and strange behavior but it left me feeling empty and unmotivated and things just aren't the same. The depression gets me to suicidal thoughts but I won't hurt myself hell I hardly do anything everything sucks now and Idk. I would only recommend this drug to people who are dangerously insane because it is very strong and it's effects last long after discontinuing. But I will say I pitty any person who has to ever take it cuz there are things worse than death.,6,23
Invega,"This drug saved my son's life. He failed to respond to any other drug and lost two years of his life in mental facilities. He was put on Invega Sustenna and within 2 weeks was changed.  Within 3 months he was almost asymtomatic.. Over the next 4 years he earned a degree in computer science with a 4.0 GPA and within 1 unit of a Masters with a very high GPA and accepted into a Phd Program. The insurance company forced us off the depot sustenna injections onto pills. Within 8 weeks he was fully psychotic and in a lock down facility. The injectable form is a miracle drug! It should be a crime to allow an insurance company trying to save a few dollars more to destroy someone's life as they have.  Write to Jannsen, Write to your congressman!",10,51
Invega,Been on invega for two weeks 9mg weigh 130 and 5' 8''. Just started my loading dose of injection 234 mg. Does not help me sleep am on rendering 15 mg for sleep. Had heart palpitations only once and hope not to have it again since starting shot I've been OK. Paranoia is at a minimal and mood is stable. Seems to be going good.,9,17
Invega,ive been on invega for four months and the delusions are gone and i dont think people are out to get me anymore all is good but i cant think straight when people try to have a conversation with me im really quite and cant think of what to say or what to talk about its so depressing im on 150mg of invega and 2mg of abilify  will these side effects get better or will i be like this for a few years i dont know i just wish i was back to my old self,4,26
Invega,This medication completely ruined my life. I gained 15kg over six months on this injection whereas before I was fit. I grew manboobs on this medication. I have no libido and complete sexual dysfunction. This medication gives you terrible anhedonia. I was forced to take Invega Sustenna after some stupid psychiatrist diagnosed me with psychosis. I had no symptoms of psychosis.,1,33
Invega,This medicine allow me to be less paranoid and this helps me by eliminating all my hard feelings about my life. The only side effect that I am getting from this medicine is oculogyric crisis.,9,14
Invega,"I have been using Invega for less than a year. The reason I appealed to this medication was because it was the only extended release medication on the market. What this means is that the medication slowly released into our body within 24 hours. Other medication when you take it, it hits our body straight away to the top and gradually decrease the medication in our body.  I find that it is good as it gives less severed side effect as the medication in our body at a constant level.  I don't have any major side effects from this medication other than depression and insomnia but that in general related to my unresolved personal life issues. My prolactin level lower compared to when I was on Solian. Less lethargic &amp; sleepy",8,18
Invega,these drugs are dangerous... they ruined my life.  made my illness much worse. the doctors are do not believe me as they think I'm an inferior life form.   SYMPTOMS INCLUDE TOOTH DECAY LACK OF MOTIVATION EXTREME WEIGHT GAIN HEART PAINS REDUCED LEVEL OFCONSCIOUSNESS  THEY ALSO MADE EXTREMELY DELUSIONAL TO THE POINT I DIDN'T EVEN BELIEVE ANYMORE.,1,47
Invega,"After My doughter' s birth I suffered from this mental illness. Except of weight gain, invega is wonderful medicine.",10,28
Invega,I feel like this medication is OK minus the weight gain feels like I put on a lot of weight and is hard to loose,5,19
Invega,"I feel gr8 once I swallow invega. It will make me a little tired at night. Sometimes when I'm hungry and try not to eat, I will get a strong stomach ache. Once in awhile I will get suicidal thoughts, but am not dangerous to me or others in any way, they're just thoughts of suicide. When it's hot outside, I tend to feel very hot, and I sweat more, too. It's hard to lose weight on this medication which is what I hate about this.....and I've gained ALOT since my pregnancy. My stomach area is inflamed with cortisol....I look horrible with a Santa belly....ppl always ask me if I'm pregnant, and some even stare. Even if I try not to eat, it is very hard to lose any weight with this medication, and no matter what you eat, you gain weight.",8,32
Invega,"Hello, I was on Risperdal for 3 years, I switched to Invega just over a month ago and am already losing a good deal of weight, I do sometimes get restless but I accept this as the price for not sleeping 17 hours a day on Risperdal, my appetite is normal and I don't eat huge portions anymore, my energy is up and I can actually feel emotions fully again, for the first time in a long long time, would recommend giving this a try to anyone - just remember some people get different side effects, for me this also took away sexual side effects that were limiting my relationships.",9,45
Invega,"I have on this medicine for 1 week. I was on Seroquel and was aggressive on it, making bad decisions. I feel much better even singing and laughing. I am eating more than on Seroquel which wasn't much but am making healthy choices.",0,37
Invega,"I was diagnosed in 2013 with schizophrenia and depressive behavior. Prior to my last hospitalization none of the meds were working on me. My family changed my physician and she firmly believed Invega combined with Sertraline would do the trick. I am most grateful to her and my family for their desire to help me. I no longer hear the voices, I can go out in the public, watch TV, listen to the radio and enjoy it like I used to. I feel safe again, the paranoia of thinking people were after me is gone, I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore and I'm starting to build a social life again. I am 24 years old and I'm grateful for the unconditional support my family and new doctor have giving me, My life back.",8,77
Invega,"I'm on Invega shots. Don't like it, gained more than 50 pounds, very unhappy but my doctor wont change the medicine.",0,32
Invega,I'm a young single mom in my experience Invega gives me a fuller lifestyle my condition is stable and controlled with  Invega so I can live with a balanced happier mind. The only downside is the weight gain and some minor side effects like milk production in my breasts. However the benefit to my mind are greater than some minor and trivial side effects.,8,38
Invega,"I was on Risperdal and I was always sleeping, gained much weight and craved for sugar. When I switched to Invega my weight went back too normal, suffer few side effects such as restlessness and sometimes anxiety but it beats those other anti-psychotics because fewer side effects and no weight gain for me. I don't like any of these medicines but I look like I'm not on any, so far so good.",7,46
Invega,I have been taking this for less than a week and it has already given me favourable results. I would recommend this to anyone.,10,46
Invega,"The medicine is partly covered by my issurance company. Current maintenance dosage 3 mg (was 6mg) Invega. After taking Invega my positive symptoms vanished completely after a number of weeks, furthermore I don't get an unreal sense (depersonalization) which was the case with Risperdal. Unfortenately I got the following side-effects (discussed with my physician): - weight gain (8 kilo's) - sometimes strange expression around mouth, stiffness - tiredness/weakness, need more sleep - intense dreaming, sometimes nightmares - harder to breath through nose - increase of ALAT blood values (80) - dizziness after sudden activity - heartburn For now the positive effects outweight the negative effects.",8,41
Invega,"They put me on palperidone and within a week, I was very aggressive. They took me straight off it again.",2,22
Invega,"Invega is a great medication. I can speak more clearly and think more thoroughly. I've felt better about myself in almost about 2 years, and I've been on this medication for about 2 weeks! I would recommend it to anyone with this diagnosis!",9,37
Invega,"I've had auditory hallucinations all my life.  Was on Geodon previously and had to keep upping the dose to keep the hallucinations and voices at bay.  With Invega, I'm on the lowest dose and have an auditory hallucination maybe once or twice a month. Despite the risk of side effects, this is a wonder drug for me. I've had no side effects.",9,49
Invega,My daughter was diagnosed with a mental illness around 12 years ago. We try almost every single medication out on the market. Nothing work.  I had lost hope. Then our MD talked to me about  invega. It was God sent. the best medication ever. My daughter is able to have a life again. she goes out without being paranoid.  It is worth every penny. some side effect but she is able to think clearly. If you are thinking about it.  give it a try.,9,79
Invega,Clears my thinking and helps my moods.,7,63
Invega,"This drug works great for the treatment of schizophrenia. It has made me feel a ton better, and its benefits far outweigh the few side effects. Be sure to take exactly when you are supposed to and not try to catch up on a dose. I did this and had to go to the hospital for treatment of muscle rigidity and uncontrollable muscle spasms, but as I said it has only happened once and happened when I missed a dose and tried to double up. So this is a great medicine, but take as prescribed only.",0,112
Abilify,"I took this drug a few years ago and felt like rubbish! My anxiety came back, I lost confidence and my eyes were rolling up. I hated this drug! But now I know every drug works differently with people so this may be good for someone else but for me it was rubbish as!",1,0
Abilify,Abilify made me completely out of control. I acted in ways I never had before and where completely out of character for me. I was not in control of my emotions I cried hysterically all the time. I had to be put on something similar to Xanax because I guess my mouth moved uncontrollably. I developed a gambling problem and was out of control with a lot of different things all at one time. I couldnt stop any of this behavior and it was tormenting. I wasnt able to cope either. Horrible experience. Do not smoke marijuana with this I would advise against it it will use everything against you and become a problem and made me sicker.,1,1
Abilify,"Whilst being forced to take this drug Abilify, on several occasions maybe around 10 or so times, mid stream during urinating my stream would suddenly stop and ejaculation would flow out and this is also very painful. This stopped happening when I stopped taking the drug.",1,2
Abilify,I'm on Abilify and no longer hearing voices but I still see people who aren't there. Even while on the highest dose of this medication 400mg injection.. I also feel like a zombie most of the time. I'm too tired even to go grocery shopping at times. I'm myself again but I'm not quite the same. I've gained weight 30 plus pounds and I've been on the drug for 3 years. I tried going off of it to 300 and the side effects were my moodiness returned... Sometimes I question if my diagnosis was correct or they are just pushing this drug out to anyone who claims they are depressed.,5,7
Abilify,"When I was first diagnosed with psychosis, about six years ago, they put me on risperidone. It was only recently that I discovered that, for all that time, even a moderate dose like 3.5mg/night was making me sleepy ALL DAY, I had no motivation, I became completely inert, I gained a lot of weight, maybe 50 or so pounds, which is a lot for my height. They recently switched me to abilify, and Ive gotta say, its a hundred times better! Im back to being  up , Im interested in things again, in being productive, I can even work. As for the weight, it doesnt give me the appetite that risperidone did, nor does it mess up my blood sugar levels like risperidone did. Theres still a bit of fatigue, but my concerta, prescribed for ADD, nips that in the bud, and besides, even without the c, the fatigue levels are just nowhere near risperidone levels. TL;DR in terms of fatigue, motivation levels and weight gain, abilify is, by FAR, the better choice over risperidone.",8,20
Abilify,This drug is okay for Psychosis but it can make me tired at times and sometimes I cannot sleep. I have insomnia from it. It takes away the bad thought but can make me have OCD like thought patterns and ruminating thoughts. I have been having odd side affects from it as well like blurred vision needing to look up all the time and sensitivity to light in my eyes.  I feel more tired on it then I do off of it. My dose I take 400mg monthly and these are the side affects I am getting off of it.,6,6
Abilify,"My son was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2017 at the age of 21. He tried just about every psychiatric medications in the market over a period of two years with little improvements and lots of side effects including weight gain etc..  Finally he was put on Abilify 20mg daily tablets ,within less than a month his condition started to improve significantly. He is now on a monthly injection which is very convenient. No side effects what so ever. It is now almost a year and we are very pleased with the results. Abilify was a god send.",9,17
Abilify,This medication Abilify has been life changing for me. I lost my job and was scared about my future living with schizophrenia. I'm currently taking 15mg daily in the morning. I do experience some symptoms from time to time. So I am going to have them up my dose to 20mg. But overall I am thrilled and thankful for this medication.,9,14
Abilify,I got prescribed Abilify 10 mg nightly at bedtime for schizophrenia. I am misdiagnosed. I am forced to take it at the moment. I have developed extrapyramidal symptoms Parkinsonism. My adrenaline and noradrenaline is also way too low. Thanks to my neurologist Im taking amantadine which helps me with Parkinsonism.,2,5
Abilify,"I've been on Abilify now for 6 years for schizophrenia and at first it worked but now I was up to 10 mg and hallucinating visual and audible, severe muscle cramping all over my body, my legs and feet never stopped moving, I couldn't eat but I'm really small bites because I couldn't swallow, it removed my sex drive I'm a sex addict, it changed me in every way possible. I went cold turkey 2 weeks ago and I feel alive again all the side effects have all but disappeared. I won't go back to it or any other psychotic drug.",2,8
Abilify,I have been taking Abilify 10 mg for a little over a month and it has helped my motivation compared to Haldol 2 mg. I had lost interest in food and dropped to 100 lbs. I've gained 25 lbs in 6 weeks since starting this drug. My hallucinations and voices are still gone. I always feel wide awake and have been taking various things to sleep. Hoping the insomnia will pass because I am full of energy. Started working again hopefully will continue.,8,13
Abilify,"I started 20 mg Abilify a month ago and the only side effects Ive had is extreme restlessness.  Especially in the morning.  It has helped with paranoia but I think the help is wearing off after a month because symptoms are returning.  Im doing some for of CBT therapy which I hope isnt bringing back things or triggering my schizophrenia symptoms but Im still going on full force with medication because Ive always stopped taking them early.   Heres to hoping all these extra side effects that have happened only this last week end: increased anxiety, paranoia, and minor hallucinations.   On a side note these extra symptoms are manageable if Im keeping busy and not letting my mind take control.   I just have to stay once the passenger seat.",6,9
Abilify,"I started Abilify a week ago at 20 mg daily.  The only side effects Ive noticed is that I fall asleep fine but I do have vivid dreams and tend to wake up throughout the night, then in the daytime I seem to have an inability to sit still for extended periods of time without moving or stretching.  That part is mildly annoying.  However, I have noticed a slight increase in energy level or the ability to just get up and take my dog out for walks and have started to get more motivated to actually get stuff done around the house, which off medication was very hard for me to do.  Ive had no weight gain, or any other side effects yet but I have only been on it for a week.  20 mg is a high dose to start at but its what the hospital gave me so its what Im taking.  Ill update my post as I get a little further down the road with this medication.  But no voices as of late but still have those delusions that Im being watched and followed.",7,18
Abilify,"I have being on Abilfy for just a day, so far no side effects. I'm on 10mg and I know it's only being a day but I have no stiffness in my legs and my appetite is non existent, which I'm happy about. The voices have quietened down and I feel in a better mood. Hopeful and looking forward to getting back to work.  Fingers crossed it will continue:)",0,18
Abilify,I have taken 15 mg of Abilify for 5 months no side effects or weight gain yet so that's good. I don't crave food and gain weight like I did on Risperdal and had bad side effects on Zoloft. I feel tired for 2 hours after I take Abilify.    It's hard to stay asleep. I wake up and do the same thing over and over all night long.,7,20
Abilify,"It was okay. Lost 5 pounds the first week I was on it. My period also came back. My only problem was that it made it hard to stay asleep. I would fall asleep, wake up and do the same thing over and over.",7,11
Abilify,"When I was 24 years old out of nowhere I started having Schizoprhenia symptoms.  I believed incredible grandiose religious delusions, believed my television sets had cameras in them and believed when people coughed or made sounds they were mocking me subliminally.  I didn't receive treatment until the age of 30 and was working full time but getting myself in wreckless situations.  After I lost everything I have besides my awesome family, I was put on a Community Treatment Order (CTO)  and after 4 months on Invega I was extremely suicidal and thought I'd never regain my normal  life.  If there is one thing I have learned about meds it's that they take a lot longer to work than you think.  I have been on 10 mg of abilify for approximately six months and for the entire duration I would have intrusive thought and random urges, then finally going into the sixth month the side effects are really starting to subside and I'm starting to fully regain my emotions and not be afraid of people.",9,36
Abilify,My father was taking this drug because the pharmacy had a shortage of navane. This drug caused him to have a mental breakdown which caused him to have to be admitted into the psychiatric division of a hospital. His schizphrenia is much worse on abilify and it fails to treat the symptoms of his disorder.,2,12
Abilify,"Was on paliparidone for 6 months and pretty much wanted to die. Switched to Abilify 200 mg injection and things are much better. Took a very long time to get over the first medication but once I did the difference between the two was night and day. I am not dizzy when I stand up and my strength has returned. I still feel a little zombie like though so cannot give it a ten but no voices and no obvious side effects. If you are suffering from a not too severe case of schizophrenia, or a drug and alcohol induced psychosis, then this drug may just work for you. Best of luck.",8,26
Abilify,Abilify is good for me. Works really well taking the 20mg tablets. Not gaining weight like I did on zyprexa.,8,13
Abilify,"I was on invega for years. Was always drowsy and gained 100 lbs over 6 years. Then I switched to abilify last October 2017. Abilify worked so great for me, lost weight, wasnt drowsy, voices dissipated, etc. Then a month later the problems started, I fell into a deep hole of nonstop gambling. It started out as just a simple free code bonus for online casinos. It then turned into a full blown addiction. Drawing my bank account anytime I got paid down to 1-0 dollars trying to win. Always chasing my losses. It has gotten to the point where I started opening credit cards for more and more gambling. I have finally put my foot down and said  NO More!   I Saw my psychiatrist today and came forward with my issues. She told me to taper off abilify and switch to Vraylar. Heres to hoping the gambling floats away with the drug leaving my body!",6,11
Abilify,"I've been on this medicine for 2 weeks.  I'm suddenly not wanting to sleep my whole days away!  It makes my ADHD go through the roof though.  A lot of pacing.  I stopped ADHD meds because of the psychosis, but I think I may start them up again since I know I was getting psychosis because of schizophrenia and not necessarily the amphetamines. As for side effects besides the above first week had a stomach ache and slight headaches.  Totally worth it though.",7,11
Abilify,Not myself on this medication. Feel lethargic. Plus symptoms of depression have gotten worse and so as to being more paranoid. Feel emotionless and zombified after 2 months of taking it. Will never take this medication again,0,14

I would like to know.. because you have destroyed my health and my life.. no way back from here. Anxiety, suicidal, depression, weight gain, metabolic syndrome, confusion, apathy.  I am not my myself anymore...abilify what have you done? Who made you? And why so poisonous?",0,28
Abilify,"Stop using it! I've been on it for 2 years and feel like I'm dying. I've had hives diarrhea, racing heartbeat, dilated pupils, etc hair loss, insomnia, weight loss and scared  I'm for my life. It has worked well up until last two weeks. I'm aboriginal and  so no cost to me.",0,8
Abilify,"I was taking a lot of pills, some of which weren't working for me. Of course what works for the guy next to me might not work for me and vice-versa because our genetic make up is different. I have been taking this drug for about 3ish years and well I didn't noticed a difference until about 2 months ago when I raised the dosage by 5mg a day. I was on other antipsychotics as well as antidepressants and stuff for bipolar disorder. I'm on 400mg injection of abilify monthly as well as 5mg pill form a day still to this day. When I raised the dosage the voices stopped. They usually come back in some environments like at work, the gym or even when I get stressed but the voices and abnormal thoughts dimmed down dramatically I feel almost normal..",10,19
Abilify,"I started abilify in January of this year, 10 mg. I'm now taking 15 mg. This medication has given me back my life. No voices, no visual hallucinations. I still struggle with mild paranoia though. I can get through the day, and that's saying something!",9,26
Abilify,Hi my son takes abilify for audible hallucinations and it has not worked. Worst drug ever hasn't cured his psychosis either,1,5
Abilify,"Excellent medication! When I was first on Abilify I hated it. At first the doctors put me on 10mg which I hated because the dose was too high ( thinking about it now) . Then my doctor raised it to 20mg which was just making me even more emotionless. So I switched back to risperidone consta (injection), but I've always hated risperidone consta, so I thought my life was over. But then I noticed I had a full pack of abilify left over from before. So I decided to take just small dose of Abilify along side the risperidone consta, and guess what? The Abilify is great at such a small dose. It completely blocks the side effects of risperidone and I can live a greater life now. So I take  Abilify and have risperidone injection every 2weeks.",10,20
Abilify,"Taken ablify for over 8 months, gradually put on 20 lbs or so. Better than Seroquel Xr for weight gain and hunger pangs.",9,5

Abilify,"I had asked my doc to change my medicine from Loxapine to something else that would allow me to get back to my baseline weight.  In 3 months, didn't see any movement towards my baseline weight.  I have been exercising (weights + cardio) for 1.5-2 hrs a day 6 days a week during this time as well while maintaining a pretty disciplined high protein diet.  My body fat % came down from 22% to 20% in a couple of months, but hasn't gone lower after that.  It's disheartening to see all that hard work yielding not so great results, which further affects my motivation to exercise considering I'm not seeing any more results.  So this med hasn't been weight neutral for me (compared to baseline wt.) although I didn't gain any more weight on it either.",6,4
Abilify,"Abilify 20 mg. I am a patient diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia, depression,  schizoaffective disorder, bipolar.  I have experienced a sensitivity to my emotions, as well as how I react to my feelings.  I really don't feel out of the normal with any sexual frustration...and I wouldn't say this has increased/decreased.  I feel less anxious on the medication, and seemingly more at ease with myself when I take this medication.  It is a hard step to have people telling you that you actually do better on this pill, when half your life ago, you didn't have mental illness, and suddenly you become someone else.   My weight did fluxuate when on this drug.  But I feel it was due to stress factors outside of a regular environment.  I feel if you place yourself in good surroundings and support you do much better at being the person you are here to be.  I am so much happier in life with a routine.  I feel like I only referred to enlongated periods of sleep because of depression, and events surrounding certain time frames hence thoughts, and reactions. Abilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.  My doctors all seem to say the same thing, and that is, This medication is working for you.  I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals.  My thought is, how do they consider this medication works for me?  Because I am not showing side effects?  Because I am accepting?  I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.  I feel that I am just not the type of person to curbside answers to things we wonder deeply about, I guess.   I don't know if there are any people who would agree then that I should ask if there are any women who have taken abilify during a pregnancy?  Just wondering what the reaction is...  Is my question?  I am a 30 year old female diagnosed with Mental Illness starting in 2004.  I started to take Abilify 20 mg. in 2004 to present.  Overall, since this medication has not been threatening to me, I feel I should embrace it.",10,44

I even gained weight on the slightest. The only positive was that I was not psychotic on it and my dreams when I was sleeping was OK! But Abilify affected my personality, I was not ME on it..

Abilify,I've never taken medication for my symptoms before. This medication makes me feel loopy sometimes and it seems like my eyes fly back for a second sometimes. It helps within a few minutes of feeling anxiety or really depressed. It has so far also made the voices sound more distant.,8,19
Abilify,"On the good side it only had one side effect for me, and that was a little bit of a increased heart beat I could feel and it made me feel like I was going to a concert or just won a prize, it felt not too bad knowing the other medicines out there for schizophrenia.",6,12
Abilify,"My experience with abilify has been great because I no longer have schizophrenia or psychosis. I have been on this medicatiom since 2008 and I have never had any side effects at all, which is brilliant! I also feel so much better since I was diagnosed, like I am a new person.",9,88

Not smoking now or intending to.  Hospitalized and medicated. They were surprised and pleased at how quickly he regained his self awareness, home in 2 weeks but recommended at least 6 months meds to forestall relapse. He feels very detached from us and himself, on 10 mgs still. He is nervous of relapse especially since told one of the symptoms of a recurrence would be inability to sleep.   Meds reduced in December.",10,37

Abilify,"Switched to Abilify from a high dose of Risperdal. Weight gain much less of an issue with Abilify, but drowsiness, depression and lethargy are a problem. Does not help with any negative symptoms. Abilify maintains a mental state with minimal psychotic symptoms for me, but also causes lactation and motivational problems.",5,31

Abilify,"My treatment for first episode psychosis started with olanzapine (Zyprexa). It was working really well but was leading to side effects amongst which weight gain was the most significant amongst them. So, eventually aripiprazole was started and I am on it for a while. It seems to be a good medicine with very few side effects and it has worked really well.",9,29
Abilify,"It has helped a little with the voices I hear and help a lot with visual hallucinations, but not touch hallucinations. Does not help that much with Paranoia.",7,30

Though I feel I'm overly medicated at 40mg per day of Abilify, I've improved to the point where I don't hear voices or feel paranoid anymore and am active in the community. I take it at night and sleep around 9 to 10 hours per night.  Not sure if that's normal with Abilify or not, but I'm not complaining.  Surprisingly no other side effects.",9,52
Abilify,"So far, so good. Abilify is extremely strong, so I have found I am fine with just 5mg daily. Taking a lower dose gets rid of most of the unpleasant side effects (restlessness and constipation).",7,31
Abilify,"I've been on Abilify for about two months. So far I've found it to be weight neutral. At first I felt faint a lot but much less now. I also had tremors at first and difficulty speaking with a lot of tiredness but all that has passed. In all it helps my psychotic symptoms and delusions, not 100% but its good enough. I would recommend it to anyone its prescribed.",7,41
Abilify,"My mom who was on Prolixn for years was put on Abilify in 2005 and was on it until 2007.  She became more needy and more annoying, but wasn't having the psychotic symptoms as bad.  The mental health center who was regulating her medication never checked her blood sugar, only blood pressure.  She took a random blood test at a Walmart store and found her blood sugar was way out of control.  She comes from a family with no history of diabetes, and she did drink soda or eat high sugar foods.  She stopped taking the Abilify cold turkey which caused her to rebound into severe schizophrenic episodes. No one could reason with her.",1,37
Abilify,"I was on one Abilify for three years, for schizophrenia. At first I thought it was pretty good. It helped with motivation. But then I started gaining weight. Weight gain on Abilify is very unusual, my doctor said.  Anyway, I gained over 50kg, going from nearly skinny at 78kg (I'm 6 foot 1 inch) to morbidly obese at 132kg. Now I'm on ziprasidone (Geodon/Zeldox) and I have lost 7 kg in six months. Hopefully that weight loss will continue. So if you start gaining weight on this drug, don't ignore it, talk to your doctor about changing medicine.",5,29
Abilify,This medication has helped my son a great deal. He developed schizophrenia when he was 16.5 years old. He came forward with his symptoms at age 18 and has been on Abilify for three years. Thanks for the medication. I wish they would get a generic form of it. $700.00 a month is huge for a thirty day dose.,8,43
Abilify,"This medication over a years period began to make me become well, not cured. I noticed it beginning in 2008. I was isolated since 1991 in my apartment. Now I'm riding the bus. I don't believe the abilify did this by itself. I helped it along.",0,38

Abilify,I have been taking abilify for a week and it seems to be working. I take 5mg. The only thing I hate is it makes me sleepy. I wish that would stop.,0,24
Abilify,I take this drug at night.  I would not recommend taking it in the morning.  It has really helped my paranoia. I have been taking it since 2004.,10,81
Olanzapine,"This medication works to make the voices less irritable to listen to, and that's the upside.  Though fortunately I'm not forced to take it.  That's because I don't feel like me anymore just taking it once.  I can feel my emotions, thoughts, completely gone.   This really is sort of relaxing but it's a dull feeling in my mind.  I don't like it whatsoever.  I'd only take it if I really needed a break, though still I may think twice next time.",3,1

Olanzapine,<b>Zyprexa (olanzapine):</b>			 I take 10 mg of zyprexa in the morning and at night. I use 1 mg of cogentin morning and night to stop side effects. Then I use 50 mg of vistaril for my anxiety.  But zyprexa makes me feel worse. The voices are still there. I'm more paranoid. I've gained 20 lbs in 1 month time. My appetite has increased. I have tremors throughout the day.  Plus the vistaril doesn't help much with my anxiety. I can't wait to see my doctor and get something else! I wouldn't recommend this medicine to nobody from my experience.  But each person is different.,0,3
Olanzapine,"This drug olanzapine cured my delusions that I couldn't stand every day since I was mentally unstable. I was feeling guilty all the time for no good reason it was weird to describe, I wasn't schizophrenic at all but playing with meds like lexapro changing quantities constantly day after day was a really really terrible mistake. After that I fell in to a guilt trip for something I did in the past that caused me to go crazy it's like PTSD but so much worse, my heart was about to explode. It's like demons tell me just finish yourself you're not a good person at all for doing this and that. After days of torture and delusions I got on olanzapine it made me calm no intrusive thoughts anymore no guilt anymore, but the down side effects of it, completely numb no emotions at all, all my senses are decreased to some degree, no motivation, waking up confused and sad..

(I used to be a very thin 160 pound male, and am now 220...) that's from all the antipsychotics I've tried combined. Zyprexa being the worst one for weight. I give zyprexa a 2 only because it did sedate me a bit relieving anxiety. I'm now on Loxapine which is supposed to be weight neutral but I'm still putting weight on from that a bit.",0,7

(She has no access to street drugs.) My mother has been on crazy meds for so long that I don't know that anything would work. Haloperodol makes her worse.

There are a few side-effects however like lack of motivation or anhedonia and significant weight gain but overall I'd say if you're struggling give zyprexia a try to balance out the depressiveness and lack of motivation which is still an issue with taking antipsychotics zi also take antidepressants Cymbalta",0,7

Olanzapine,"Olanzapine is the only thing that has worked for me. Gives me good sleep, improves my appetite, keeps my mood up, balanced and happy, curbs psychotic tendencies. Only weird side effect is that I feel that I get stimulated from it in some way. In that I have a more intense inner dialogue because of it. Self talking if that's what you would call it. I have considered changing the drug because I thought it was promoting my psychosis inside while normalizing my behavior on the outside but each time I stop it I can't sleep I get very very agitated and I feel like there's a burning in my skull and I feel like my mind is being seared. I think I have just become dependent on it. But that's ok since it keeps me going.",10,8
Olanzapine,"Zyprexa / olanzapine made my psychotic symptoms, delusions, paranoia and auditory &amp; visual hallucinations far worse. It took me a while to notice the connection. Whenever I take a break from it, it's hard to cope at first, but within days/weeks/months my symptoms become less intense; I got better. At first I assumed the continued worsening of my mental state was simply my disorder developing by itself. I had to increase my dosage to cope with this.Then, as I took a break from the meds, my issues reversed. I finally gave up the meds and my psychotic symptoms are similar as to how they were before I was prescribed olanzapine, but not nearly as severe as they were whilst on the medication. This medication did more harm than good. Is it actually researched enough to be prescribed as easily and often as it is?

Also my motor skills have been cut in half, I keep stumbling over stuff like I'm drunk and having blurred vision all day.  This medication is a mental handicap in a bottle.

My doctor put me on 7.5mg briefly but my appetite was unreal. I wish I could take more but I've already put on 30lbs. I can't say if it has impacted my psychosis as the other anti-psychotic was working when I started on this. I think it helps with my anxiety. I sometimes take an extra pill when I have an anxiety attack. It helps but maybe it is the placebo effect.",0,11
Olanzapine,"<b>Zyprexa (olanzapine):</b>			 I took this medication for 9 months before the voices in my head went away. I continued taking this medication for two years. I'm still not convinced that this medication had anything to do with the voices going away. I think if it were effective, the voices would have stopped sooner. I also always felt sedated and never had any motivation to do anything. I used to be the person who always read all of the recent news and was well-informed but this medication turned me into a lazy and ill-informed person. I also used to run and do yoga often but this medication made me have no motivation to do those things anymore. I gained 40 lbs on zyprexa. I just started taking latuda two weeks ago and I have already lost 10 lbs and I feel like I have much more energy and motivation. The only issue is that now I have insomnia from zyprexa withdrawal. I wish my doctors would have originally prescribed latuda instead of zyprexa so I wouldn't have had to deal with the withdrawal.",0,11
Olanzapine,"I have been on a 2.5 mg pill a day dosage for a while, and that was ok. I didn't expect that after 3 years of it working well, I would start experiencing brain fog, dizziness, slurred speech, excessive sweat, and in an downward spiral start losing control of my mind.  I have been prescribed the 5mg one but I feel lightheaded all the time as if I'm gonna faint , and I couldn't stay awake more than 8 hours the first days because of it. The delusion I have is that I will die, of a brain cancer , every night I think of that before going to sleep, I wish I never got Schizophrenia.",6,4
Olanzapine,"The drug is not entirely good. Like most other drugs, it has its own good and its bad. For me, I've been on it for 11 months now and I can assure you, it wasn't easy at first. But now I'm used to it. It relieved all my symptoms and I'm doing fine. I had to change mindset and accept the diagnosis of schizophrenia before it actually started to show its effectiveness. Nothing good comes easy. No matter how hard, if you face your fears with courage there is certainly light at the end of the tunnel. Just be true to yourself",0,12
Olanzapine,I had a crazy paranoia after having a 4 child. They said severe postnatal depression.  I agreed.  Something wasn't right. But meds took my paranoia in next 3 days which is wonderful but as I was eating healthy I started to munch 2500 calories a day. I really recommend to get substitute.  I will ask tomorrow to the Dr,6,1
Olanzapine,"I am a caregiver for a friend with schizophrenia.  She refuses to take her meds because she says she doesn't need them.  While hospitalized with her Olanzapine tablets they were  crushing up the up, dissolving in water and then placing in food or drink.  The  liquid dissolves into food, including pizza and coffee without a trace and without changing the taste.  This asset of this drug has made things so much easier.  After about 6 weeks of 10mg a day, she is so much easier to get a long with and no longer a consideration for a danger to herself or others.  Highly recommended for those patients that have responded well to Olanzapine (Zyprexa) while in the hospital or previously.",9,3
Olanzapine,I actually said to the person whom hallucination I was hearing that I have taken the medicine then they didn't spoke for 8 hours it was sunday.  I think they said the person should talk with you on a phone or something maybe he/she is hiding something like a built in speaker or something.,0,2

Olanzapine,Works well for paranoia aspect of schizophrenia but caused diabetes.  Would recommend Latuda as a substitute (it does not cause weight gain or diabetes),5,6
Olanzapine,This drug has not helped me in any good way. I have gained weight I still hear voices I have become depressed and suicidal thoughts. I feel like I'm sitting at the bottom of the ocean. This drug is not helping at all. I can only imagine the damage it is doing to my body. I have poor bladder control. I slur my words and it drugs me out. My memory has become shocking. And everyday is a struggle to function. I'm so tired :(,0,9
Olanzapine,"I have had a long history of depression, despair and anguish. For a long period of time I felt like I had failed. I was dying, not physically but we are more than physical creatures. I used to be extremely intense,  This culminated in a psychotic episode and I was institutionalized in a psychiatric ward. I was told by a doctor to take zyprexa on the first night. Following this the next couple of days were a blur waking to eat and take medication is all I remember. Long story short, I have had the happiest, most productive and most stable years of my life, although I don't feel as intellectually sharp as once it is small price to pay I  feel.

For instance, Olanzapine may be suitable and effective for some may not be suitable for others. Therefore it is very important to closely observe the behavior of the person.

They put me on Zyprexa 5 mg.  It worked for a few months, but the brain fog and lethargy was causing problems at work so I decided to taper down to 2.5 mg and then stop.  I really wish my doctor told me not to go from 2.5 immediately to zero because the withdrawal has been an absolute NIGHTMARE.  Scary dreams, non-stop anxiety, really jumpy, headaches, depression, and my brain fog has never been worse.  I finally knuckled under and am taking 0.6 mg just to take the edge off.  I don't want to discourage others seeking help but stay away from Zyprexa!",0,7
Olanzapine,"<b>Zyprexa (olanzapine):</b>			 Zyprexa doesn't work well with any antidepressants - be careful - but it can work used together with lithium, depakote, or lamotrigine. The serotonin guided anti-depressants activate mania and rapid thinking, and fuel anxiety, drugs such as lexapro - taken with anti-psychotics - can be a nightmare. In mixed diagnostics such as schizoaffective, there are many bypasses and alternate routes  -  i.e., I take a minimum of risperdal, which helps with an additional foundation for more centeredness and 'structure,' - and keeps my head clearer on 1.5 mgs; and I also take 300 mgs seroquel XR, to act, not only as a bipolar safe keeper, but also as an anti-depressant.  If you're looking for Olanzapine with an anti-depressant edge, try bipolar meds.",0,4

I was 24/7 agitated, restless, constantly pacing around and fidgeting, getting into arguments and screaming at people. My doctor prescribed Clonazepam but it did nothing to take it away. Eventually I had enough and stopped taking Zyprexa altogether, and within only 3 days all of these symptoms disappeared and I was back to normal.

Olanzapine,My quality of live has improved significantly on this medication. It has calmed my voices a lot and helps me to sleep at night. The weight gain is a problem but I guess I don't mind it because I am feeling so much better. The hallucinations and delusions are less frequent and I can think clearly and get on with other things. I also don't wake up with that hangover-like-effect in the morning. I think I have found my miracle drug.,10,16
Olanzapine,"It has been a long and dreadful road but has been getting better ever since I first took it, voices are going away ever so gradually but they ARE going away. Used to not be able to watch TV because the hockey game always seemed to be about me and my insecurities (if i watched anything on TV it was hockey). Hate to have it happen but I grew from 150 pounds to 190-195 pounds and from either a waist size of 30-32 to 34.. and I didn't seem to be eating very much more then what I used to, although after I eat something big I get hungry a lot quicker than what I used to.

It made me go from sitting on the couch hidding, to working full time as an electrician, sometimes up to 10 hours a day, something I thought I would never be able to do again. There were only two problems. I was unmotivated, I didn't have any passion for life. I was  just going through the motions. However this is much better that being  psychotic and suicidal. In the 9 months I was on the medication, I gained almost 100 pounds. This happened even when I was eating the same amount as before I was medicated. Again, this is far better than being angry and paranoid.",0,20

Olanzapine,"I wasn't prescribed Zyprexa for OCD, but for psychosis. But since I developed OCD on this med, I wanted to warn people.  Before Zyprexa I was slightly perfectionist and obsessive, but because of Zyprexa I developed full blown OCD (upon withdrawal). Ever since using Zyprexa I can't function because of obsessions and many other problems that started with Zyprexa. I changed into a completely different person: angry, sad, obsessive, controlling, unkind.  Zyprexa is said to cause OCD in some 20% or so of it's users. Please stay away from it if you already have OCD...it may worsen it.",1,7

Having been taking it for four years, my cognitive skills have improved due to improved social functioning. My advice is to give it a chance. Be prepared to tolerate some physical drawbacks for the sake of improved mental functioning and cognitive gains based on stability of mind. It is true that some forcefulness will be lost from your thoughts, but you may want this. Depending on your state of mind, this drug could be a life saver.",8,24

In terms of treating psychosis I have given this medicine a 7/10 (so far) because although I am getting some paranoid thoughts still, it has enabled me to think more clearly and rationalize them better.

Latuda,"I was diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia about 20 years ago.  Being a 19 year old girl and being forced to take medicines like, Zyprexa, Risperdal, Clopixol and sometimes two at once. The side effects were horrendous. Took away my sex drive completely, at the worst I put on over 40kg in 3 months, I lactated for many years, my periods stopped. My whole world stopped how could I ever had a boyfriend or get married while piling on so much weight, eating and sleeping with no sex drive and leaking boobs Antipsych meds especially back then were horrendous in terms of side effects. I started Latuda roughly 7 years ago, so at the age of about 31 and finally I have my sex drive back although I don't believe it will ever be the same, at least I am back in working order there, my boobs no longer leak, I've lost some weight, and I can feel again.  Downfall I can lose my patience quickly and over react. I balance that with a low dose antidepressant as an add on",8,14

I would get the akathisia so many have talked about when took this med with food, especially at the 40 mg dose.  The 40 mg dose helped control my mood swings.  I go through a whole range of good and bad moods within a single day.  It makes it hard to live with myself, especially if I don't get proper sleep.  I take Trazodone also.  The use of these two medications together is supposed to be monitored closely.",5,11
Latuda,"I took Latuda for three years until I figured out it was causing my anxiety attacks the whole time. It caused uncontrollable movements of my face, jaw, tongue, and hands. I also had restlessness, an uncontrollable urge to get up and walk around, self-isolation and fear of others, high blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, extreme sweating, trouble sleeping, blurred vision, weight gain, and racing thoughts. It was torture. I will take the chance of relapsing in order to determine if I will remain normal without meds. In these three years I never had any symptoms and I don't think it would be intelligent to immediately assume it was because the meds had been working the whole time.  I now believe antipsychotics are not the end all solution to mental illness and more attentive and accurate evaluations of patients need to be conducted to get people off these horrible drugs as soon as possible.",2,14

Latuda,"My psychiatrist put me on Latuda to treat my condition. I started with a small dose and went up to a maximal dose. I was informed that the drug could cause side effects, such as extreme unrest when getting to sleep. After two months of use I started to feel horrible side effects. Feeling extremely vulnerable in social situations and anxiety. Often I experienced the worst nightmares through the nights while being/feeling fully awake. I had uncontrolled panic attacks and started to sweat heavily. Many unpleasant thoughts and even experiencing not being alone. Also physical abnormal behaviour in the face/mouth/tongue. This could last for many hours until I fell to sleep being totally exhausted. I never had such issues before. It happened mostly once a week. I always was afraid to go to sleep. For a long time I didn't suspect the drug being the trigger. But at the end I quit the drug for good, even so my doctor didn't recommend it. After I was off the drug everything went to normal again.",1,15

I've been on it for a month now on 60mg and the voices and delusions have gone way down, not entirely gone yet. The only problem I have is the anxiety, its a very intense nauseous anxiety that is worst about an hour or 2 after I take the latuda med with dinner. I thought I could deal with it but its gotten a bit worse? I feel it throughout the day now. I asked a doc yesterday for something to help with it and I got buspirone. It doesn't seem to help much. I'm really sad that I might have to find a new med as others I've tried have had worse side effects. I've tried zyprexa, risperidone and abilify. I want latuda to work so badly but am losing hope.",7,11
Latuda,"It works.  I saw my thought patterns change, I was less angry, less paranoid. I always find a persons worst possible intentions and run with that as to why they act, that stopped happening. The crazier thoughts disappeared. I still felt depressed and unhappy and stuff,  but started becoming more optimistic, REALISTICALLY, instead of if you look left someone is going to give you a million dollars or was go get a damn job, stupid example but thoughts were more grounded in reality. HOWEVER, I started getting really bad anxiety. So bad I had to stop. Hopefully I can find a way with my doctor to manage the anxiety because everyone around me noticed I was a LOT easier to deal with.  40mg a day. If you have psychotic thoughts,  try it. You may not notice a difference at first but you'll notice you become a lot more approachable and scare or emotionally hurt people a little less than you use to.",9,16
Latuda,"I started getting voices and hallucinations after I received stress at workplace.  It impacted my normal reasoning and rational decision making at that time, my head was filled up with visuals and voices of my previous friends who were creating a racket in my head and controlling my body movements. I was hearing theories about how my family is in danger , buy property, police- government is tracking my activities, god and religion, demons, capitalism etc. I resigned from my job, could not find another one,  could not get social security, became depressed, had nightmares, used to sleep a lot, had hypertension and high blood pressure, gave my newly married wife a really hard and distressing time. Psychologist gave Latuda,and  the hallucinations and voices started diminishing over a period of 2-3 months, the dosage initially high at 160 mg  then reduced to 120 mg, now 80 mg it has been 8-10 months .  Medicine has a bit of drowsy side affect and impacted my cholesterol",7,18
Latuda,"I was not on it long enough, to say if it worked. I stopped taking it because I had a bad dream.",0,7
Latuda,"I started on Latuda 40 mg and felt great. I had come off 17 years on zyprexa which had left me 25 kilos heavier and on the brink of diabetes. At 40 mg I had no side effects. Then I was put under a trauma and had a slight psychotic break. My dose was increased to 80 mg. When this happened I started having major vivid nightmares. Also huge anxiety. I got to the end of what I could take and read a review that said the nightmare lasts 1 month. I was at that so I persevered. They stopped. I have lost 19 kilos now and can function reasonably well. I can work part time, and am well during the day. My voices are now minimal. I can drive better. The only problem is the anxiety I get about 2 hours after having the tablet. I am now trying to manage that. I dont know what side effects I will get over time , but I am now living a good life during the day. It was really really hard at first. The anxiety is there but I am trying to put into place strategy to manage it.",8,14
Latuda,I hate latuda medication. I've been on this drug for about a year now. I started getting nauseous when I first started now I'm getting vomiting and diarrhea everyday getting worse. I've been and had blood tests and ultrasound on my stomach nothing physically wrong with me. I advise anyone considering on taking latuda should think twice of side effects like mine. This experience is so serious I can't believe they invented a medications which mucks up  your physical health. Cheers.,1,10
Latuda,"Latuda worked really good at controlling my schizophrenia for the 2 years I was on it, but I occasionally did hear some voices on it still at 80mg. Unfortunately it had some side effects on me that I didn't like - gained weight, lost libido, and slept 12-13 hours a day on it. So eventually the side effects just got to me and I changed to a different anti-psychotic. Now I'm on Rexulti and my voices have gone away completely and have no side effects. So I would say Latuda was an OK medication for me, could have been better, could have been worse.",6,9
Latuda,Best antipsychotic I've been on in regards to psychotic symptoms being treated and cognition returning to normal. The main catch was akathisia. An intense internal feeling of distress and inner tension mixed with objective motor restlessness. I bounced my legs constantly and felt tense. I was fine during the daytime but after I took it it was awful every night. My eyes would roll backwards from the emotional agony. I would  feel frustrated and tense mostly every night. I had to take benadryl to cope with it. I would not recommend this if you're prone to akathisia. Good drug overall besides that.,7,6
Latuda,"I was on seroquel for a long time, couldn't take the sleeping and weight gain.  I switched to latuda.  Nauseated after taking so now I  take it late with a late dinner 350 calorie meal, no more nausea.  I'm rather fatigued from it so I tend to drink coffee during day to keep me going.  I'm loosing weight finally on it.  Good antipsychotic, I use it for anxiety and depression along with Cymbalta and inderal in am.  Lost 20 lbs.  Zyprexa and seroquel were awful.",10,7
Latuda,"Currently transitioning to Latuda because Zyprexa's metabolic side effects were too much for me. So far, It's going well. I'm on 60 mg and I sleep, eat, and live pretty normally. My voices aren't completely gone but they're manageable. Decreased anxiety and depression. Aside from helping my schizoaffective disorder, it seems like my PTSD is under control as I have fewer freak outs and nightmares.",0,15
Latuda,"I was experiencing auditory hallucinations (voices), EXTREME paranoia and anxiety to the point where I couldn't leave the house, and bipolar depression. I never tried any medications before because I'd had bad experiences witnessing other people who had taken medication for bipolar depression and schizophrenia. I couldn't take it anymore and  began taking Latuda 20mgs and it's a miracle drug. No more voices, depression, paranoia, anxiety, or fatigue immediately. I take it with dinner around 6:00pm everyday and it makes me tired but I get up full of energy at 5:00am every morning now (I used to be so tired I couldn't get up and get ready in the morning). Now I have energy and focus all day. My mood is even - calm and positive. I'm extremely focused and active now. I haven't experienced any side effects other than the tiredness in the evening after I take it. I haven't experienced any increased appetite or weight gain. My only concern is I'll be crushed if this stops working someday.",10,19
Latuda,"My wife took Latuda for her psychosis. At first, it was great because among the 5-6 anti-psychotics she have tried, none were effective at all on the auditory hallucinations. Only Latuda works (at 40 mg) in reducing the voices. However, the akathisia that came with it was so bad that she was unable to be in public places without people staring at her cause her legs were shaking constantly and vigorously. It badly affected her social life and we had no choice but to give it up.",6,7
Latuda,"I've been on Latuda 6 months now for schizophrenia.  I've had paranoia and persistent auditory hallucinations; this drug was a miracle for blasting them away.  For the first 3 weeks, I was a sleepy wreak and didn't dare drive, but a lot of that went away over time.  It took probably about 2-3 months for the hallucinations to finally go away, you could tell the volume on them were going down every day.  I had moderate akathisia. This was on 40 mg of Latuda.  After months of having no voices, I decided to try tapering off it to 30mg and noise hearing has started to creep in again (sob!), but my akathisia much went away and a felt a bit more alert.  I'm debating staying on this at 30mg, I seem to also have a lot of demotivation and anhedonia since I started taking the drugs but they could just also be negative symptoms of psychosis.  In sum, great for hallucinations, not that great for everything else.",6,6
Latuda,"Latuda has not taken away my sounds and lights (which I take/took to be Divine signs), but I have gained a distance from the phenomena that I didn't have on Zyprexa (and no weight gain!). I'm like the main character in 'A Beautiful Mind' who never ends up without his CIA boss being around, but he learns to ignore him and he fades into the background and shuts up. They're still there, but it's not God torturing me; I just have schizophrenia (schizoaffective). (Must be taken with food or else nausæa.)",9,6
Latuda,"Started Latuda a few years ago. Was initially prescribed to take 80mg, which was too much and caused drowsiness. I reduced to 40mg and had minor fatigue. Now I take 30mg, and have taken 30 mg daily since then. It's cured my schizophrenia at the cost of giving me anemia.",9,8
Latuda,"At first I thought I had found a *miracle medicine* for my schitzoaffective disorder, as I was waking up early each morning with energy. Over time I noticed an increasingly strong yet underlying feeling of anxiety, which led me to have constant severe panic attacks. At one point I had to leave the mall as I had such a feeling of anxiety, terror and paranoia washing over me. If you are prone to anxiety or paranoia steer clear as you will likely feel out of control on this medication, especially at the doses above 10mg.",3,10
Latuda,"Only been on it for a week and am feeling extremely miserable. It's hard to describe but the only effect it has had is a couple hours after I take it I get this unbearable mental discomfort where I feel both exhausted and restless at the same time. It's driving me crazy! Other than that, it's had no other effect, positive or negative.",1,10
Latuda,"This is worst drug i ever took prescribed  for schizotypal personality disorder and major depression by one of my past psychiatrists. I don't even understand how this helps other people at all. The psychiatrist thought it might help me, according to her, it was because I mentioned anger, which was very black &amp; white of her , um hello...I have severe depression, yet she goes ahead &amp; prescribes me an antipsychotic that shouldn't have been prescribed to someone with depression like me, so   I go on a very low dose, after three days of walking like a zombie, barely able to keep my eyes open, agitated, worse depression, I developed convulsions when trying to sleep on the 3rd night, screaming, crying in pain, barely able to breath &amp; was rushed to the hospital, given ativan to calm me down, stopped latuda entirely",1,5
Latuda,"Started on 10mg-increased to 20 then to 40. The blurry vision cleared up for the most part after a few months.  Latuda definitely makes me feel better. Not 100%... but better. Having to take with 350 calories is difficult, especially before bed  and the weight gain was pretty bad but then started taking calcium, magnesium, zinc and dropped the weight... weird... but it works. Just need to make sure the magnesium is maleate... others make me to tired.",7,6
Latuda,I have been on it about a month. I've lost all motivation to do anything other than sleep. I'm nervous all the time. I can't feel my left hand. I have nightmares every night. I've lost all desire to eat. My vision is blurry. My psychiatrist is of no use as he only works three hours a week since he's borrowed from another program and I have no way to get in touch with him. this is why I don't trust doctors.,1,6
Latuda,"First off I would like to say none of these medications are effective to me, they have never helped me in any considerable way. I was diagnosed schizophrenic but for the most part it was the anxiety controlling my life, never the hallucinations. Every medication on the market besides two or three cause an enormous amount of weight gain and intolerable side effects with no legal recourse if encountered. The pharmaceutical industry has hired many attorneys and lobbyists to destroy all liability in the event of a potential hazardous or death inducing side effect for the most part. In California it is impossible to sue a doctor (psychiatrist) who commits malpractice due to the cap on awards. It's all snake oil but with actual side effects.",5,8
Latuda,"I've been on Latuda for 5 weeks now first week 20 mg second week 40 mg the third week 80 mg the fourth week 120 mg 5th week 160 mg. Side effects of sedation, constipation. It has not started to uplift my mood I wonder how long will it take for it to motivate me. No increase in my appetite thank God.",4,7
Latuda,"I started taking 60 mg of Latuda nine days ago for schizoaffective disorder. After a few days, I felt much more positive, hopeful and cognitively clearer than I had while I took 60 mg of Geodon. However, in this short time I have decided that the side effects of Latuda are simply intolerable. I've had increased appetite; breast tenderness; and inability to have an orgasm. I'm going back to Geodon, but I'll be taking a reduced dose (40 mg). As much as I hate the anxiety and sedation involved with Geodon, those side effects are more manageable for me than the ones I've experienced with Latuda.",0,11
Latuda,"I took this medication for nearly two years at the highest dose of 120mg for schizophrenia. It completely helped with my hallucinations and delusional thinking. I had been on 650mg of seroquel previous to starting Latuda and I would still hear voices. I take latuda with a snack at 8pm and I am ready for sleep between 930 - 10pm and sleep well through the night. My only complaint is that it does cause an increase in appetite and weight gain. At this present time I take 900mg lithium, 150mg luvox, 72mg concerta and Latuda dose has been lowered to 80mg. I have noticed that my appetite has decreased. Delusions and hallucinations have not returned.",9,15
Latuda,"Been on Latuda now for about 1 ½ years because of Paranoid Schizophrenia. I am on the max dose of 120mg taken every night before bed. I have absolutely no side effects at all, tried ability before it, was hit with a wave of side effects, and then switched to Latuda as it was unbearable, been happy ever since with it. Also take 3-400mg of Seroquel daily and 4mg of Imozop(Benzo) before bed.",0,10
Latuda,"Diagnosed as bipolar with depression and severe anxiety years ago, however my reason for Latuda doesn't quite fit in the bipolar category, so I'm posting it here. I have been on another AAP (Zyprexa) for two years, but it doesn't cover all the bases for me. Got to the point where paranoid thoughts (as my Dr calls them) dominated a lot of my time. I was blockading my door, wouldn't leave my appartment after dark, etc. Dr added 40mg of Latuda to my cocktail. I don't know how long it took, but one night I realized thatI haven't been blocking the door. Sadly, I gained 15lbs in two months so I tried to quit the Latuda. As soon as I did, I went right back to paranoid me. I will have to deal with the weight (only side effect for me) to keep semi sane.",9,18
Latuda,"I started latuda last May for my schizophrenia. I developed schizophrenia when I was 16 (4 years ago) but after being on like 6 billion types of medications, this one seemed to work best..the side effects were the worst! I remember one experience clearly. I was on vacation at the beach last summer and I took a latuda pill before going out to eat with my family. It kicked in after 30 min time. All of a sudden, I began feeling extremely sleepy, dizzy, and I had EXTREME akathisia? So terrible, I couldn't explain it and to top it off, my heart was racing I was having a panic attack! In the restaurant! And at the same time I was sleepy as hell, but I kept my cool. My mum took me back to the hotel where I immediately fell asleep..terrible",3,15
Latuda,"I took Latuda for about 5 months. First two weeks at 20mg - worked fine. Thought clearer, overall better mood. Two weeks later I was bumped up to 40mg - problems ensued. Severe restlessness (akathisia). Was then bumped up to 80mg, then 120, then down to 100... the akathisia became more unbearable at every dose. That, and my brain started feeling overly stimulated and my body gained this sense of underlying fear. Plus, I gained TERRIBLE anxiety. I can verify the anxiety stemmed from the Latuda because I forgot to take my meds one night and it was gone by the following morning. I'm giving Latuda a 6 because I know how it felt when it worked properly and I know it benefits many. Unfortunately, things just didn't work out for me big picture.",6,17
Latuda,"I generally suffer from bipolar, anxiety and some form of psychosis, the delusions from psychosis caused most of my anxiety and I had to be put on Wellbutrin, risperodone, and klonopin. With this medication my simptoms of psychosis are much better relieved and I was able to withdraw from using klonopin all the time to control my anxiety. I found what I needed.",8,12
Latuda,"I have been taking Latuda for schizoaffective for the past 14 months.  I have been sleeping like a baby and have no delusions what so ever.  BUT I have been very addicted to temptations. I have been drinking a lot more than usual and I gained a total of 20kg in these 14 months. My lifestyle is not helping either. I just feel empty, careless, disorganized and unhappy. I do not have motivation to even wash the dishes or dress up like I used to. I am ready to switch to another medication but this med is good for delusions.  One of the severe side effects that I have experiences is I have been talking to myself. Repeating my thoughts out loud all day everyday.",4,16
Latuda,"Few days on it. Ability didn't work for me. Doctor has me on cogentin and Inderal for akathisia. Taking Trilafon also. Quiting Klonopin slowly, taking Adderall for sleep issues: hypersomnia. Taking Paxil bc it was good in the past(20years ago). Slightly hypomanic which is good for socializing but not for calm mind. Can't keep a calm mind, not hearing voices, but having a discussion with imaginary person in my head. Is this Pyschosis bc I would hate to get off AD(Paxil) which is great for social phobia",9,11
Latuda,"you can go insane if you get off this drug cold-turkey and if your drinking/drugs inbetween you will end up at the hospital like me, i stopped using for 3 months now, the last few days have been a nightmare I was smoking weed while not taking latuda, and I had a depressive breakdown where i ended up in emergency twice in the past 4 days, i was so fatigued my eyes were shutting on their own and i thought i was going to die if i fall asleep, its a feeling of insanity dont mess around with this drug. Go step by step as your doctor tells you, overall the drug has its ups and downs some of the side effects are dreadfull, goodluck",4,8
Latuda,"this medication gave me a bad reaction, it gave me restlessness in my legs and suicidal thoughts, i don't recommend this drug for me personally.",1,15
Latuda,"I was told that Latuda is a better tablet than taking my older tablet which is stelazine 10ml a day only side affect was that it made me tired all the time and I was sleeping that's all. So I'm now on 60ml a day I had side effects bad ones and worse thing happened tonight i have never in my life been so aggressive against my daughter and my husband ....never had I been like that on Stelazine ..never... My husband was in tears tonight because of my attitude and my aggressive behavior ...I didn't feel any remorse what so ever, definitely not a good tablet for me. I have both Schizophrenia and Bipolar and depression. I don't care how hard it is to get Stelazine but I'm going to go back on the stelazine its so much better for me and my family.",1,15
Latuda,Been on Latuda 40 mg for six weeks. Doctor put me at 80 yesterday and the restlessness I experienced last night was unbearable.   All day I haven't been able to stop moving my feet and legs.    Called the doctor today and she said continue taking it and go to the emergency room if the symptoms get worse.  PLEASE HELP.  Does the restlessness go away !!?????,2,20
Latuda,I take been taking Latuda for year i have gone to 40mg up 80mg  I can take 40mgs but it doesn't help and 80mgs makes me feel high and i hate that feeling and the voices don't stop or seeing shadows where people are wearing black gowns i still need more help i can't work because i feel like everybody talking about me all the time but worst thing is seeing things thats not really there,10,18
Latuda,Latuda has been a hero in my battle against schizophrenia.  Aside from having to take with food and having trouble cooling off in hot weather I am very glad to have latuda. This drug makes it impossible for me to function acceptably in life due to side effects such as sedation and other cognitive issues.  So I accept that gladly as it cures my schizophrenia. I take 120 mg each day. I try to save my pill as late in the day as I can but usually take it around one o clock. So I cannot function at a job acceptably and need help functioning at home occasionally but my schizophrenia is entirely in check for the most part.,10,18
Latuda,"I remember going into a deep depression where I didn't want to live anymore. Being from an african background it was hard to explain this to my family as they don't believe in things like depression. This made things a bit worse for me. I would have panic attacks at work and suffer from racing suicidal thoughts. One day I had a psychotic episode and ended up being sectioned for a month. I refused medication at first because of all the horrible stories. However, I gave in. I started on 20mg then it was upped to 74mg. This was the greatest decision of my life. I have never felt so happy and grateful for my life. I can laugh again without faking my emotions, i can eat again I can sleep again. This is a miracle drug!!!!",10,47
Latuda,"After years of thinking life was over and I would have to live with paranoia in public, voices in my head and uncomfortable horrific feelings for life I tried this and within a month it evenly spreaded what I was once missing in my head from being traumatized by the death of my grandpa. At first my tounge was numb and anxiety was high the next day after taking 40mg at night with food but taking serequel or hydroxzine every 6 hours frequently they coordinated perfect with each other and through out my experience I forgot about the thoughts, delusions, and was able to live my life care free as my psychosis being a bad memory",9,24
Latuda,"I have been taking this medication for 2 years now. First year, it worked like a wonder pill. Minimal side effects such as nausea and drowsiness after in jesting it. Some times I would have a feeling of impending doom like if my life was going to end after I took the pill. Later this medicine turned out horrible. I don't know what a night sleep is. It causes me severe insomnia. I feel always tired even after sleeping 15 hours.  I'm suffering from a severe depression from this medicine. It makes me irritable and angry. It drains me of motivation.  The only thing I can say good about this medicine, is that it has caused me no weight gain whatsoever. This medication drains me from being able to live life.",6,19
Latuda,I was put on Latina by my doc along with my geodon. Couldn't eat anything or I threw up everything including my other meds I got extremely psychotic so once off it I felt a whole lot better with a small amount of seroquel added instead,0,8
Latuda,"Horrific experience. Was only on it for 1 week (40mg). Muddled thoughts, numb tongue, restlessness, severe insomnia, nausea.",2,14
Latuda,"40mg for Schizoaffective Disorder: Somewhat improved my paranoia, insomnia and intrusive thoughts. However it made my body feel extremely tense and agitated. I can hardly describe how horrendous this feeling was, like every cell in my body was screaming, like I needed to physically explode. I would try to pace around to relieve it, but nothing worked, and I felt exhausted at the same time, so I would lie down, but the feeling was unbearable so I would get right back up again. It was maddening. My pdoc gave me a beta blocker to make it go away, but that didn't work. After a month on this med I just quit it cold turkey as I was terrified of it, felt like I could not handle one more night of feeling that way.",3,19
Latuda,I put a 5/10 rating because I have just started taking Latuda 20mg. The only side effect I have noticed is feeling drowsier than usual. I am most likely going to give it 1-2 weeks before jumping to the conclusion that it doesn't work (as I was notorious for doing that after like 2 days of taking the medication). I am also taking Wellbutrin 300mg and Trazadone 50mg. I find I take Latuda after dinner or late snack as it does make me drowsy. However the Trazadone is like a miracle drug for me. Before I was taking it and when I took a break from it when I couldn't afford them at the time I had the most restless sleeps imaginable. Was skeptical about starting Latuda as I am also taking 2 other medications. But Psychiatrist said it was safe.,5,10
Latuda,We have heard of the Latuda 20-40 mg restlessness/sense of muscle quiver being controlled by a small .5mg Benztropine daily dosage taken with the Latuda.  Both were taken in evening as it seemed to help with sleep. I believe Benztropine may normally be given for Parkinson. This was suggested by an experienced Psychiatrist who reviewed medications looking for one that had the side effect to address and to help with the sense of muscle quiver.,9,18
Latuda,Works great. Took away the voices I was hearing. I don't really experience side effects.,10,26
Latuda,Needs to be taken with food. Worked well for about a year then It gave me random bouts of severe depression and fatigue. I think when I was taking this I had more homicidal thoughts. Thank GOD I don't suffer from these side effects anymore. I'll stick to my abilify.,2,9
Latuda,"I have been taking 60mg for Schitzoaffective disorder. Have come off Flupenthixol and am now coming off Seroquel. Best I've felt in years. Much happier. Delusions are gone, not hearing voices or misinterpretting things. I take it in the morning with food but have found when I drink Jamacian tea I throw up and have a swore stomach at night. Have switched to decafe tea with lemon juice.",10,25
Latuda,After yrs on with a number of meds all these arguments in my head are starting to quite down some and starting to make sense 50 pounds later and completely isolated from the world feeling like I can make a reality check and at least have hope of a better and brighter day just checked out after an episode and hope they got it right finally. Started @40 and just ate and took my first 60... Feeling positive at least with sample packs,7,18
Latuda,"One day at work I felt an explosion in my head after that i thought that undercover cops were watching me following me couldn't sleep at all eventually had a psychotic break Checked in to Psycho ward released and prescribed Zyprexa. After gaining about 50 pounds and feeling like a zombie I tried latuda within a couple weeks started to feel better. I had much more energy sleeping a normal 6-8 hours wakeing up refreshed and ready to take on the day,confidence back able to go out in public.after a few months with an active life style all the weight i had gained on zyprexa fell off. normal again Great.  Side Effects: memory loss,dry mouth. Dose:20 mg night",10,57
Latuda,"After a casual conference with the people arguing in my head, we decided to give Latuda a try.  My first 20mg pill went down my esophagus without any problems whatsoever.  I have high hopes for this drug therapy.  Blessed Be.",10,34
Latuda,"I've only been on this medication for 2 days but at 60mg once daily it dries my mouth out terribly and my mind is blank when around people. Hoping to move down to 40mg and if that doesn't work 20mg, If my doctor lets me. Trying to get the right dose is so stressful.",1,19
Latuda,I only started this yesterday and today I already can feel that things are easier to deal with!! I'm looking forward to feeling somewhat normal.,7,28
Latuda,So far the med has me feeling terrible akasthia when I take it at night. Im switching from risperdone 2 mg to latuda 80 mg and I dread taking the pill at night because I know I'll feel like im jumping out of my skin,5,21
Latuda,I took latuda with Lithum and ended up in the hospital for 2 months. I don't know if it was the mixture but I was doing all right on Lithum. When I Started Latuda I started to fell funny not myself. When I was in the hospital I lost movement in my body and I was going down hill fast. After about 4 weeks  I started going the other way but I needed physical and occupational therapy to walk and move my arms plus my breathing was no good. This was the end on December and here it is June and still going though therapy. Not a good experience with Latuda.,1,25
Latuda,"I take several meds for my mood disorder. It is difficult to truly evaluate the medication fully, but also I just started it one week ago. I am taking Latuda 40mg and I plan to ask the doctor to adjust it to 80mg. Some people experience restlessness which can be controlled with a sedative or congentin. I am still tapering off of Zyprexa and I am noticing some moodiness, but I also take Adderall which helps me concentrate and stay focus around people which is my biggest fear. I hope it works out for me as it does for others to.",7,26
Latuda,Just started it today. Doctor wants to stop the Haldol and taper off the Zyprexa. I also take something for ADD which helps the intrusive thoughts which then allows me to finally concentrate. No nausea as others have stated and just a mild sleepiness. See doctor in 2 weeks.,8,22
Latuda,"I have suffered for 8 years been hospitalized and tried many different  meds with side effects varying and different levels of therapeutic results for my schizophrenia/bipolar disorders.  A few months ago I had a severe schizophrenic episode was hospitalized and went from a high dose of Seroquel to a high dose of Abilify.  Once home, I experienced severe muscle spasms, insane restlessness, and weight gain. I knew I could not tolerate the medication but I wasn't stable enough or even completely to a good baseline despite the high dose.  My doc introduced me to Latuda and it was a miracle pill almost immediately.  My weight continued to creep up on it but that is my only complaint. I take 20 mg with no nausea or side effects.",8,30
Latuda,My daughter is on this med she is 23. Her dr. Told her to take at dinner time  300 calories or more she eats about 6 or 7 because it makes her a little tried. But she still love doing things outdoors . I thank god for this med. It works for her.,8,33
Latuda,Since starting latuda at 20mg a day and now up to 120mg a day. My life has more balance and no depression. My only concern is my psychosis is still the same but my hallucinations have dropped off.,9,29
Latuda,"I am on day #10 of this medication and the side effects are very minimal although I am having trouble sleeping. My sleep patterns have been affected. I feel more energetic, as If I have to be doing something. My mind will not stop repeating the same thoughts, over and over again. I am also very hungry and have an increased appetite. It does however, cause me to think about things differently as I know what my general reaction to things would be, or have been in the past, but, it allows me time to think of an alternative besides being explosive. It has calmed me, and more than once, has helped me to cope with a situation differently and more calmly. Overall, I think I'm doing well so far. I plan to continue this medication for some time.",8,29
Latuda,"My wife started getting non-stop dark and intrusive thoughts. Diagnosis was psychotic depression or atypical bipolar depression with psychotic features.  She took Latuda for three weeks, and it simply didn't work at all. The only thing good I can say is that she didn't suffer any side effects. She went from 20mg to 60mg.",1,32
Latuda,"Latuda is the best mood stabilizer there is. At least for me. It certainly does not act like a stimulant towards depression and nor does it act like an SSRI. The medication is awesome because it feels more like a mood stabilizer than saying it's an anti psychotic even though it is, Latuda helps everything. And the side effects are minimal. I would recommend this medicine to who has depression, paranoia and bipolar disorder.",9,82
Latuda,I suffer from schizoaffective disorder with bipolar tendencies. Latuda can cause severe breast pain on high doses.  Definitely helps stop voices and completely resolves depression.,10,66
Latuda,"Latuda was good at demolishing my hallucinations. I took Latuda for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However it didn't help my mood- it made it worse. Brought me either mad or deeply and dangerously depressed. It also made me have a large allergic reaction in my mouth, sores and bleeding.",7,36
Latuda,"I have been taking Latuda for about two years now and I must say that it really works good for stopping the voices in my head. I also do not get depressed anymore like I was without the Latuda and my Bipolar disorder is a lot less hectic. I recommend this medication to anyone who might be suffering with Bipolar, Depression, and Scizophrenia. Latuda really works.",10,97
Latuda,I've been on it for about 12 days..I'm also on Luvox..so far I don't see much benefit out of it. It's made me extremely tired and hungry..2 things I hate to be..I'm really hoping with some more time it improves because my anxiety is horrible and a few years ago I was into heroin and Xanax so I don't want to fall down that road again. The Luvox definitely helped but not enough..I'm also only on the 20mg of Latuda right now. How long do you think it takes to get the full effect?,2,18
Latuda,"Latuda is the best thing that has ever happened to me. The only thing I can complain about is the price and the zero appetite it gives me. It does cause severe drowsiness about 2 hours after taking it from me, but when I wake up I am refreshed and full of energy. Which is something I have never experienced. Being schizophrenic since I was 7, how I feel today is a God send. Thanks to Latuda I am finally starting to form a life.",10,115
Latuda,Latuda has been very helpful to me. I have not gained any weight. The symptoms have lessened to the point where I am much more functional and can follow my daily routine. So far so good.,9,65
Latuda,"In my opinion only, this medication has marginal efficiency in treating the positive and some negative symptoms of my psychosis. This medication help me think better and organize my thoughts more clearly, along with significantly reducing most of my delusions. However, from my personal experience I do not feel that this medication is very effective in treating depression, or depression related issues such as crying and getting angry easily. Otherwise, this medication also has some positive effects in treating bipolar symptoms.",8,44
Latuda,"Excellent medicine in my experience. I've been taking it about 6 months. I'm now working and going to school full time. Anxiety has improved significantly, almost to pre-illness levels. I feel great cognitively (creative, zero psychotic symptoms, memory seems pretty sharp). Although I've never really gained weight on Risperidone for 2 years was relatively weight neutral. I've actually lost 5-10 lbs. since taking Latuda, pretty much without trying. The one minor annoyance would have to be that it requires 350 calories for full absorption and it puts me to sleep about an hour after taking it. I end up eating a small meal/snack before bed every night (yogurt, nuts, etc.).",10,81
Latuda,"I've tried many antipsychotics in the past like Risperdal, Geodon, Abilify, Saphris and Seroquel. My favorite has to be Seroquel. Latuda compared to all atypical antipyschotics is better tolerated than most second generation atypicals and it doesn't have the drawback of extreme akethisia like Geodon. Also glucose and lipids levels changes where compared to that of placebo so I'm happy to say this purchase was worth it.",8,40
Latuda,My daughter takes 40mg of the Latuda. You should always take it with your dinner no later then five or you will be tried in the morning. This was told to me by her doctor. She has been on this medicine for about 7 months. She sleeps well at night.,6,58
Latuda,This is the end of the second month on Latuda and I like it because there aren't any side effects.  I sleep less than I did on the many other medicines I have tried.  I'm finally losing weight (with the other medicines I'd gained 40 lbs).  Overall I have more energy with this medicine and it seems to be very effective.  I take a 40mg dosage.,10,76
Latuda,"This medication did not work well for me. I keep hearing voices while I go to sleep. It seems like the medication only works for 3 or 4 hours. Then, it stops working. I am also having a problem with center of balance with this medication. I keep having mini-vertigos. I saw the other ratings and I was tempted but this medication just did not workout for me.",4,62
Latuda,"2 weeks ago I had a severe psychotic break despite both Abilify and Geodon. To avoid hospitalization, my doctor and I usually add Zyprexa, but I wanted to avoid the rapid weight gain, though it is otherwise a miracle drug. This time we tried Latuda. Within about 5 days my thoughts were much clearer, my energy higher, mood brighter. Overall Latuda seemed the medication I had been looking for: Zyprexa without side effects: no weight gain and no extreme sedation (in fact the opposite): I sleep fine at night. I do at times take a little Ativan, at night but not always. And I wake in the morning eager to rise and meet whatever the day brings. In short, I haven't felt better and more hopeful than this is a very long while.",10,120
Latuda,"I have been taking this medication for almost a month. I had a good experience at 40mg and opted to try the higher dosage of 80mg. It has been nothing short of amazing. I have been on every AAP except for Clozapine with mediocre to average results.. even in combinations. I do take the 80mg of Latuda with 300mg of Seroquel XR, but the Latuda has made a huge difference cognitively.",10,99
Latuda,I have been taking Latuda a little over a week. So far my experience with this medicine has been a positive one. I started out on 40mg but a few days later I was switched to 80mg. So far the only side effects I've had are an extremely dry mouth and loss of appetite. I am also taking Lithium and Artane. Will post more after I've been on Latuda a little while longer.,0,94
Risperidone,"I was on Risperidone for 5 weeks, the first 2 weeks were a struggle but by the end of the month it had really tackled my anxiety and hallucinations. It did make my paranoia really bad for a week but apart from that I was starting to feel okay again. I had to stop as I started to lactate and as a 20 year old I found it quite distressing so I was swapped to aripiprazole, I hope this one works as well as risperidone did!",8,1
Risperidone,I was put on this about 2 years ago! I was hearing things and seeing things and completely lost my mind and was admitted and this is what they put me on! At the time it saved my life and made me feel normal again! But as time went on I noticed I didnt get excited about anything anymore I had no emotions! I gained a lot of weight I went from 150-210lbs. I stopped having periods. It made me have the worst anxiety ever. Im currently weaning myself off of it! Come to find out I had an over active thyroid and had radiation done and was told I can come off this medicine! So it was my thyroid that made me go crazy and put on this medicine! Im glad to say Im coming off of it! Im ready to enjoy life and have my feelings back! Hope this helps someone!,5,10

Otherwise a great medicine for me I've been active in the community and able to control some of my unusual thoughts. I would recommend this medication, but be cautious of the side effects. I've been on the med for 2 years now. I gained 40lbs and remarkably I was able to lose 50lbs since starting Risperdal.",0,11

Risperidone,"Im helpless as I cant think anymore. There is no more excitement! There was a time when Id feel happy about nature. I loved going for walks, when I was in London Id go out. I was in bliss. Suddenly Im sinking... its helping me so much by removing psychotic thoughts (all gone) yet its ruining my happiness. I ask: is there an alternative? I want my happiness back, I want to be able to exercise again, I dont want that fear of going out, I want to be able to think as I read... Ive lost interest in movies, music, studies and sports. Has anyone felt so tired on it? Has anyone been sprawled on bed like me the whole day doing nothing?",3,7
Risperidone,ok and good price .,7,1
Risperidone,"The problem with this medicine is that while it is supposed to treat depression and works wonders to remove hallucinations and unwanted thoughts (some, at least), it makes one so tired and lazy that one becomes depressed in the process of being so tired! This is truly a conundrum. It made me extremely demotivated as I lost all interest in movies, exercise and study.  Yes, the benefits of Risperidone are immense but I would not go so far as to say that they outweigh the side effects. The side effects are lethal. They hit right at the body and mind, and that is a big problem. Not to mention the weight gain that occurs because of inactivity and excess sleep. I find it really hard to shave in the morning! My mornings are the worst. I just can't get out of bed.  Yes, it makes one sleep VERY well. There is no doubt about that, yet it is the TIREDNESS which is a big problem. I don't know why drug companies can't figure out a way to make a medicine that does not have such side effects.",1,2

Risperidone,Sandoz is great because I quit to get the weird anxiety after being on Sandoz and I had with others resperidone brands. Let me explain myself. I had a type of anxiety with other risperidone brands. At times I felt like to repeat words what others said in conversations. I become a weird person. One time when I didn't say good morning to a neigbour outhside nextdoor to me and I had obsessive anxiety about this event and went to the neigbour's home and apologize. Thank godness for Sandoz. My theory is that there's additional rubbish in other brands.,9,6

Risperidone,<b>Risperdal (risperidone):</b>			 I was forced to end taking haldol 2.5 mg/night after 27 1/2 years -over 10000 days- because they stopped making it. I was prescribed risperdal. I started at 2mg a day and they reduced the dosage to 1 mg. I also stopped cogentin and Prozac because of strong discomfort. After around 40-50 days of risperdal I didn't sleep as well and felt utterly horrible like a zombie- like it was torturing and destroying my brain. I came to my senses and rid myself of all medication whatsoever since it seemed to be harming my brain and not helping me sleep and have recovered from all mental illness in about 5 days and am getting somewhat less sleep but feel a lot better overall. So the medicine was good in that it convinced me to get rid of it and all medication and completely recover. I believe people who take risperdal should be reviewed after 30-50 days or so and given the option to stop taking it and maybe all medication if they have horrible zombie like side effects like I did.,0,24
Risperidone,"<b>Risperdal (risperidone):</b>			 This has helped a lot for my daughter's hallucinations. She was not diagnosed with schizophrenia, so her hallucinations are related to either her epilepsy or something else. There have been a couple of times where she stopped taking it because she felt better, but then the hallucinations would come back. She had to go on the highest dose after she stopped taking it the first time, so if you find this works for you or a loved one, just make sure they don't stop abruptly.",0,16

If your job involves mental math or coding, this will become much more challenging. It dulls your emotions even beyond what your horrible affliction will. I became an impotent robot with no processing power. The cure, at least for me, was worse than the disease. I have since learned to ignore, or at least recognize and not take them as absolute reality.

Upon entering the hospital, I was aware of my surroundings and completely aware of reality. At time I was also unsure of my own diagnosis so it wasn't easy taking the Risperdal. I was officially diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder and paranoid ideation. Upon release I found the side effects to be negative. I was sleeping the majority of the day at my house, and had a difficult time finding motivation to leave the house.

When I was on Respirdal I gained a lot of weight and was drowsy. I even developed minor gynecomastia that still remained 3 years later. I'm in my 30s now and the gynecomastia surgery isn't covered by any insurance companies. What was covered was the ultrasound and mammogram. I don't have the money to pay for the glandular breast tissue removal surgery. People notice my male breast growth and tell me that I have breasts.

Even when I first starting the meds the first few times I believed I was being poisoned but I usually felt like everyone offering me drinks or food were trying to harm me so not really anything new there. That part has calmed down a fair bit. I hope one day they can find a way to completely rid me of this so I don't have to rely on medications all the time cause I sometimes forget to take them or  I can't find them on occasion. I'm glad I'm back on them though after I was initially told by the mental hospital that I'm not to have them anymore which mucked me up.

Now that I am off of it my list of negative side effects is quite large. I wouldn't reccomend this medication to anyone. Especially if you have an endless diagnosis in the first place. Be careful believing what your Drs say. They get all of their recommendations from pharmaceutical companies. Once I was off of this medication Drs. Refuse to listen to me.

That, and my brain started feeling overly stimulated and my body gained this sense of underlying fear. Plus, I gained TERRIBLE anxiety. I can verify the anxiety stemmed from the Latuda because I forgot to take my meds one night and it was gone by the following morning.

Lurasidone,<b>Latuda (lurasidone):</b>			 Latuda has been a hero in my battle against schizophrenia.  Aside from having to take with food and having trouble cooling off in hot weather I am very glad to have latuda. This drug makes it impossible for me to function acceptably in life due to side effects such as sedation and other cognitive issues.  So I accept that gladly as it cures my schizophrenia. I take 120 mg each day. I try to save my pill as late in the day as I can but usually take it around one o clock.

I would have panic attacks at work and suffer from racing suicidal thoughts. One day I had a psychotic episode and ended up being sectioned for a month. I refused medication at first because of all the horrible stories. However, I gave in. I started on 20mg then it was upped to 74mg. This was the greatest decision of my life.

I am also taking Wellbutrin 300mg and Trazadone 50mg. I find I take Latuda after dinner or late snack as it does make me drowsy. However the Trazadone is like a miracle drug for me. Before I was taking it and when I took a break from it when I couldn't afford them at the time I had the most restless sleeps imaginable. Was skeptical about starting Latuda as I am also taking 2 other medications. But Psychiatrist said it was safe.,0,10

Within about 5 days my thoughts were much clearer, my energy higher, mood brighter. Overall Latuda seemed the medication I had been looking for: Zyprexa without side effects: no weight gain and no extreme sedation (in fact the opposite): I sleep fine at night.

I will never be tapered off but the point in lowering is to maintain stability but at the same time control the insatiable  desire the meds give me to eat. Also to try and get back some of the energy the meds just simply take away - energy to cook , clean , and exercise. I have been trying different meds for 10 years and abilify is my preferred. After refusing those other antipsychotic meds that have literally been around forever , abilify injection seemed to be a happy medium and you dont have to take a pill everyday (because I know I wont).

My psych blamed invega lowered my dose to 3mg and increased my dothepin to 150mg.  I was still robotic in thought and movement but I could lead a productive life.  My head did feel very dry and I was in survival mode though.  I started having 2000mg fish oil capsules a day and my thoughts became fluid and so did my joints and movement.  It's not a cure but I would recommend fish oil capsules to people with psychotic illness taking these meds.,0,27

This drug strips you from ANY type of delusions, even your good ones like wondering if a person likes you or thinking you are the best person on this planet.

Not only to mention I was only experiencing delusions prior to medication. They have gone away now but it seems as though my thoughts echo mimic align with sounds I hear. Also, it feels as though there are bugs under my skin due to micro muscle spasm. Worst part about this drug is that it causes you to zone into things like stare at things or become immobile in your line of vision. Which this only happens occasionally it really is difficult to drive or hold down a job. I have heightened energy level with adding Abilify.

After a 4 month hospitalization and oral antipsychotics including Zyprexa she was still totally delusional. After starting community based treatment she was started on Invega Sustana and within 2 months she was better than she has been in over 10 years. I was able to see glimpses of who she was before her brain disorder took over her life. She thinks that the shots are like water and they do nothing. Anosognosia  (lack of insight) is a very difficult issue with her so I am beyond pleased this medications ability to improve my love ones life.,0,9

At the time I was having a episode... and forced treatment against my will. The doctor told me that it was the only drug I could take and coerced me into taking it. 432 mg shot that was nearly the twice the max dose. I didn't like it because before I was on a dopamine 2 and not dopamine 3 antagonist like this drug does. Absolute crap! Before the episode I was healthy able to run 10k in under 40 minutes on Seroquel xr.... and now I'm dealing with withdrawals and high inflammation that was .7 now 4.3 because of stupid shot. It'll make you not able to think or do your job. You'll lose interest in things like working out and being healthy. The drug is rubbish!!,0,10

I'd honestly rather that I have delusions and hear voices than to have life stripped away from me like this. I am not hearing voices but my doctor still wants to keep me on it no emotions or feelings on this med currently on 156mg injection,0,12
Paliperidone,<b>Invega Sustenna (paliperidone):</b>			 Well I have been on this medication for some time now.  It has helped me with the voices but to be honest you do sleep  a lot and that's the only constant this medication has.  It makes you eat a lot and as far as sex drive goes lol I won't talk about it.  I think that it depends on who you are around to make you feel depressed you have to keep in mind that it's a serious disease but with medication it can be manageable. And if you are getting too fat exercise. You will get the weight off.  Keep positive people and remember the struggle is never done we may always have a stigma put on us or a label put on us but prove the enemy wrong.

I did not have bad anything except a drug issue- which they already  knew  as they had tested my urine, but they  didn't take that into consideration.

This at least allows me to get an erection. It's done a great job at controlling my positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The voices are dulled down to the point of single sentences and like only 1-4 times a day so it's a lot more managable in day to day life. Started on sustenna, went on the tablets and now on Trinza. All versions work very well for me. This medication is the metabolite form of risperdal and it's a god send.

But the side effects sucks such as high prolactin levels which resulted in low testosterone, anhedonia, and lower emotions",0,14
Paliperidone,<b>Invega Trinza (paliperidone):</b>			 Trinza and Invega Sustenna have been the only medication that has worked for me. I had almost no symptoms for a year which was great. I don't know if my schizophrenia is getting stronger or if the medication is losing its effectiveness. I had to add a second antipsychotic (Latuda 40 mg) to manage the emerging voices and delusions. I'm giving this a 9 because it gave me the year I needed to put myself back together to be ready. The side effects I've had were only pacing back and forth and shaking my leg.,0,5

I experienced temporal lobe damage from this medicine and a CT scan showed atrophy of my brain after I stopped taking it.

Sometimes when I'm hungry and try not to eat, I will get a strong stomach ache. Once in awhile I will get suicidal thoughts, but am not dangerous to me or others in any way, they're just thoughts of suicide. When it's hot outside, I tend to feel very hot, and I sweat more, too. It's hard to lose weight on this medication which is what I hate about this.....and I've gained ALOT since my pregnancy. My stomach area is inflamed with cortisol....I look horrible with a Santa belly....ppl always ask me if I'm pregnant, and some even stare. Even if I try not to eat, it is very hard to lose any weight with this medication, and no matter what you eat, you gain weight.",0,32
Paliperidone,"<b>Invega (paliperidone):</b>			 Hello, I was on Risperdal for 3 years, I switched to Invega just over a month ago and am already losing a good deal of weight, I do sometimes get restless but I accept this as the price for not sleeping 17 hours a day on Risperdal, my appetite is normal and I don't eat huge portions anymore, my energy is up and I can actually feel emotions fully again, for the first time in a long long time, would recommend giving this a try to anyone - just remember some people get different side effects, for me this also took away sexual side effects that were limiting my relationships.",0,45
Paliperidone,"I have been on this paliperidone for 2 years. It's the best for managing the voices and delusions. They stopped and went away very quickly. Side effects were lactation, increased sex drive, insomnia. I would recommend it to anyone who needs it because it works very well",9,2

Paliperidone,"<b>Invega (paliperidone):</b>			 I have on this medicine for 1 week. I was on Seroquel and was aggressive on it, making bad decisions. I feel much better even singing and laughing. I am eating more than on Seroquel which wasn't much but am making healthy choices.",0,37
Paliperidone,This medication appears to have no side effects at all on me.  I get 100mg of the long lasting injection every month.  You don't feel anything.  No different except a bit sleepy after the injection.  It is a far cry from risperidone.  It is early days yet as I have been on it 3 months now but overall I would say my thoughts are slightly clearer. Weight gain minimal.,8,2
Paliperidone,"<b>Invega (paliperidone):</b>			 I was diagnosed in 2013 with schizophrenia and depressive behavior. Prior to my last hospitalization none of the meds were working on me. My family changed my physician and she firmly believed Invega combined with Sertraline would do the trick. I am most grateful to her and my family for their desire to help me. I no longer hear the voices, I can go out in the public, watch TV, listen to the radio and enjoy it like I used to. I feel safe again, the paranoia of thinking people were after me is gone, I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore and I'm starting to build a social life again. I am 24 years old and I'm grateful for the unconditional support my family and new doctor have giving me, My life back.",0,77

Paliperidone,<b>Invega (paliperidone):</b>			 I'm a young single mom in my experience Invega gives me a fuller lifestyle my condition is stable and controlled with  Invega so I can live with a balanced happier mind. The only downside is the weight gain and some minor side effects like milk production in my breasts. However the benefit to my mind are greater than some minor and trivial side effects.,0,38
Paliperidone,<b>Invega Sustenna (paliperidone):</b>			 I have been on Invega for 5 months now and it has significantly improved my quality of living. Prior to the shot I was on numerous antipsychotics and would begin to stop taking the pills and go into relapse with symptoms. I'm not on the shot and auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoia have decreased dramatically. I like that it is a monthly shot and it cuts down remembering (or wanting) to take a pill once or twice a day.,0,29
Paliperidone,"I have been on Paliperidone for nearly 2 weeks, I was on Ziprasidone before that, even though it was working a charm for me, but I had to change to Paliperidone because Ziprasidone was not licensed in the UK. However, starting the Paliperidone I was a bit skeptic as I was on Resperidone before but it wasn't for me, and taking it with Venlafaxine didn't help either. Anyway, Paliperidone so far works a treat in terms of auditory hallucinations and the weird thinking, even a bit better than Ziprasidone, however, I'm still going through bouts of fatigue, dizziness and extreme demotivation. In addition to a very increased appetite, which is a problem for me since I'm already obese. And also a very rapid hear beating nearly all day. Any info? thx",8,2
Paliperidone,"<b>Invega Sustenna (paliperidone):</b>			 I found this medication to cause side effects of swaying while standing up &amp; sometimes rocking back and forth whilst sitting down.

I am now going to try Abilify and hope I don't have bad side effects but I know that without my medication I would relapse.",0,23

Paliperidone,"I've been taking paliperidone for the last year with good results: a proactive lifestyle including uni and drinking with no delusions, depression or paranoi and few hallucinations at night. However, the prolactin level has increased to where the possibility of breast tissue (gynecomastia) can form. As a preventive measure, my doctors have suggested that I change medication. I have had perceptibly minor side effects (akinesia [which annoys others, but when genuinely interested, I stop], monthly upper lip muscle tightening, sexual dysfunction, broken sleeps, vivid dreams, hypnagogic hallucinations [weird and sometimes scary]). Would recommend. Consult doctor, but if risperidone worked, try this as it's a metabolite of risperidone.",8,2

After taking Invega my positive symptoms vanished completely after a number of weeks, furthermore I don't get an unreal sense (depersonalization) which was the case with Risperdal. Unfortenately I got the following side-effects (discussed with my physician): - weight gain (8 kilo's) - sometimes strange expression around mouth, stiffness - tiredness/weakness, need more sleep - intense dreaming, sometimes nightmares - harder to breath through nose - increase of ALAT blood values (80) - dizziness after sudden activity - heartburn For now the positive effects outweight the negative effects.",0,41

So this is a great medicine, but take as prescribed only.",0,112
